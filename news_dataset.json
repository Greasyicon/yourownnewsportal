And we stand by that. But 16 months into this, we\u2019re convinced that our requests will not be met. And to continue with the same strategy doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Simon said from St. Petersburg, Florida, where the WTA is based.\n\n\u201cSo we needed to look at a different approach. With this, our members believe it\u2019s time to resume the mission in China, where we believe we can continue to make a positive difference, as we have for the last 20 years, while at the same time making sure that Peng is not forgotten. By returning, hopefully more progress can be made.\u201d\n\nAlthough there have been no reports of Peng sightings in public since carefully orchestrated appearances during the Beijing Olympics in February 2022, Simon said the WTA has \u201creceived assurances from people who are close to her, that we\u2019ve been in contact with, that she is safe and living with her family in Beijing.\u201d\n\nHe added that the tour has been assured by the Chinese Tennis Association, the sport\u2019s national governing body, that \u201cthere won\u2019t be any issues with our athletes or our staff while they\u2019re competing within the region.\u201d\n\nHe called the change in course \u201can organizational decision\u201d and noted: \u201cThe great majority of the athletes were supportive and wanted to see a return ... and felt it was time to go back.\u201d\n\nThe tour\u2019s schedule in China should be revealed in the next couple of weeks, Simon said. It will begin in September and include the season-ending WTA Finals in Shenzhen and other stops similar to what was played in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic led to a round of cancellations.\n\nPeng, now 37, won doubles trophies at Wimbledon and the French Open and reached the No. 1 ranking in doubles; in singles, she was a U.S. Open semifinalist and was ranked as high as No. 14. She dropped out of public view after saying in a social media post in November 2021 that former vice premier Zhang Gaoli forced her to have sex. The post was quickly taken down by Chinese authorities.\n\nThe following month, Simon \u2014 with the backing of the WTA Board of Directors, players, tournaments and sponsors \u2014 said the tour would suspend play in China. That was the strongest public stand against China by a sports body and cost the WTA millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nPeng later tried to recant, including in a controlled interview during last year's Winter Games. After the Olympics, the global attention and outrage raised by her case \u2014 \u201c Where is Peng Shuai? \u201d was a popular rallying cry, a T-shirt slogan seen at Grand Slam tournaments, a trending topic on social media \u2014 seems to have lessened.\n\nThe ATP men\u2019s tennis tour and the International Tennis Federation, which oversees the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup along with lower-level tournaments for individual players, recently said they would resume operations in China after staying away because of COVID-19.\n\nThe ITF said Thursday it welcomed the WTA\u2019s decision to resume play in China.\n\n\u201cRegarding Peng Shuai, while she appears safe and well, we will continue to seek assurances about her ongoing safety and welcome all other organizations\u2019 efforts to support her, both publicly and behind the scenes,\u201d ITF President David Haggerty said.\n\nBack when he first delivered the news about leaving China, Simon told the AP: \u201d... the one thing that we can\u2019t do is walk away from this, because if we\u2019re walking away from the key elements \u2014 which is obviously not only her well-being, but the investigation \u2014 then we\u2019re telling the world that not addressing sexual assault with respect to the seriousness it requires is OK, because it\u2019s too difficult. And it\u2019s simply something that we can\u2019t let happen.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Thursday\u2019s move could be construed by some as backing down, Simon replied: \u201cWell, everybody will have their own opinions on that, for sure. I can understand how someone might look at it that way, for sure. But we took a stand that no one else has. And, I think, from that, we did receive some things that we didn\u2019t think we would get, as well,\" citing the assurances about Peng's safety and that of WTA players and staff upon return to China.\n\n___ Follow AP Tennis Writer Howard Fendrich on Twitter at https://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "US jobless claim applications highest in more than a year", "text": "U.S. applications for jobless benefits rose to their highest level in more than a year, but remain at relatively low levels despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and job market in its battle against inflation\n\nU.S. applications for jobless benefits rose to their highest level in more than a year, but remain at relatively low levels despite efforts by the Federal Reserve to cool the economy and job market in its battle against inflation.\n\nJobless claims in the U.S. for the week ending April 8 rose by 11,000 to 239,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department said Thursday.

One day earlier, the government said consumer prices rose just 0.1% from February to March, down from 0.4% from January to February and the smallest increase since December. However, prices are still rising fast enough to keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates at least once more, beginning in May.\n\nLayoffs have been mounting in the technology sector, where many companies hired aggressively during the pandemic. IBM, Microsoft, Salesforce, and DoorDash have all announced layoffs in recent months.

He said many customers are booking flights farther ahead of time, but there is more \u201cnear-term churn\u201d -- cancellations remain elevated since Delta and other carriers relaxed cancellations policies during the pandemic.\n\nDelta said corporate travel has returned only to 85% of pre-pandemic levels. Bastian said some of it will never return but is being replaced because people who aren\u2019t working in the office are taking more trips that combine work with leisure.\n\nDelta's first-quarter revenue jumped 36% from a year earlier, to $12.76 billion, with money from passengers in both economy and premium cabins and income from its refinery near Philadelphia.\n\nDelta is the first big U.S. airline to report first-quarter numbers. The Atlanta-based carrier needs revenue to rise if it is to be profitable because costs are soaring.\n\nIn the first quarter, traditionally the slowest period of the year for travel, Delta spent 28% more on fuel than it did a year earlier, an increase of $584 million. The price of fuel could be heading higher, after OPEC and allies including Russia agreed to cut production of oil.\n\nDelta's labor spending jumped 20%, or $560 million \u2014 and that did not include $864 million to cover signing bonuses for pilots, who ratified a new contract with big pay raises in March. Other expenses, including aircraft maintenance and selling costs, also jumped by double-digit percentages.\n\nDelta's loss was smaller than the $940 million shortfall it recorded in last year's first quarter. Excluding the cost of the pilot bonuses and other one-time items, the Atlanta-based airline said it would have earned $163 million, or 25 cents per share. Analysts predicted adjusted profit of 29 cents per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nDelta forecast that it will earn between $2 and $2.25 per share in the April-through-June quarter. That would smash analysts' expectations \u2014 they are looking for $1.66 per share.\n\nCowen analyst Helane Becker said the outlook was better than she expected and is a \"good sign for other international carriers.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, will depend on a good start to the summer travel season. It promises to be a busy one, with roughly as many passengers as in pre-pandemic 2019 but not as many flights.\n\nFlight cancellations and delays surged last summer. Airlines that were caught short on staffing last year have hired thousands of pilots and other employees. They are counting on the federal government having enough air traffic controllers.\n\n\u201cI think this summer should be significantly better than last summer,\u201d Bastian said. \u201cWe've got another year of experience under the belts of our new employees \u2014 another year of hiring and training of our pilots to ensure they are ready for it.\u201d\n\nShares of Delta were down more than 1% in morning trading. Airline stocks fell the previous day, led by a 9% decline for American Airlines, which gave an earnings outlook that disappointed investors."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "\u2018Embarrassing\u2019: Pentagon leaks damage US security, analysts say", "text": "Public exposure of secret US intelligence assessments could compromise sources and strain ties with allies, experts say.\n\nWashington, DC \u2013 There is plenty of uncertainty about the supposed secret US government intelligence assessments circulating online: Are they authentic? Are they accurate? Who leaked them? And why?\n\nDespite growing questions, experts seemed to agree on one thing: The leaks are damaging to Washington\u2019s intelligence-gathering and foreign policy.\n\nThe documents include details of the Western military support to Ukraine, information about Russia\u2019s war effort and intelligence collected from allied states.\n\nUS officials have not denied the validity of the documents, acknowledging that they \u201cpresent a very serious risk to national security\u201d and appear to be real, though in some cases altered. But they warned that the leaks \u201chave the potential to spread disinformation\u201d.\u200b\n\nAnalysts have said the leaks risk exposing intelligence sources and could cause a diplomatic headache for Washington.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official who also served in the CIA, called the leak \u201cdamaging\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the United States needs to do a better job of securing classified information,\u201d Mulroy said.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest concern\u201d, he added, is the possible compromising of methods of intelligence-gathering, including human sources. Mulroy stressed the importance of the \u201cability to protect our assets, protect our way of doing business, so we know information that goes into making policy\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the intelligence assessments \u2014 which were meant for senior officials at the Pentagon \u2014 did not include the names of possible human sources, experts said the revelations could help US adversaries, particularly Russia, identify American assets in their midst.\n\nGlenn Carle, a former senior US intelligence official, described the leak as a failure \u201cof major magnitude\u201d that \u201csome people may well die from\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny counter-intelligence service will be hastily and thoroughly now working out who has access to that information in their country and reducing the number of possible individuals,\u201d Carle told Al Jazeera\u2019s Inside Story.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s quite possible that they could identify the sources \u2014 and depending on the country, that will damage or destroy their career or get them killed.\u201d\n\nCarle said the leaks were an \u201cunfolding disaster\u201d because intelligence agents have the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d to protect their sources, which could be harmed by the slightest breach.\n\n\u2018Embarrassing\u2019\n\nThe leaked secret documents started making headlines earlier this month, after spreading in some obscure corners of the internet weeks before that. The Pentagon and the Department of Justice are investigating the issue.\n\nA Washington Post report published late on Wednesday traced the files to a single poster in a private server on the online platform Discord. The user, known as OG, told friends that he works on a military base, the newspaper reported.\n\nDavid Silbey, an associate professor at Cornell University who specialises in defence policy and military history, said the fact that the documents were first posted on a private forum indicated that the supposed leaker did not aim to widely spread the information.\n\n\u201cOne of the strange things about the leaks from the very beginning was that this was a really odd place for them to show up,\u201d Silbey told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf it had been a sort of espionage act, why put them on a random Discord server? You wouldn\u2019t reveal it publicly anyway; you\u2019d just pass it back to Russia. If it was a leak to share with the public, it\u2019s about the worst possible way to leak it.\u201d\n\nHe added that the leaker seemed to be \u201cshowing off\u201d. But regardless of the intent, the leak remains \u201csignificant\u201d, Silbey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documents reveal that the US has insider accounts from some countries it considers partners, including South Korea and Egypt, suggesting that Washington could be spying on its allies.\n\nFor example, in South Korea, an opposition leader has called on Seoul to \u201csternly respond to the spying of state secrets\u201d after the leaks.\n\n\u201cIt can cause risks in relationships with our allies, which according to these things, we also collected [intelligence] on; that\u2019s going to be a diplomatic rift,\u201d said Mulroy, the former Pentagon official.\n\nHe added that, while any feud with partners may be repaired quickly because \u201cmany countries collect information on even their friends\u201d, it is still \u201cembarrassing\u201d when that notion becomes public.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nGovernments around the world closely guard information of this nature. US law makes it a crime to divulge \u2014 or even mishandle \u2014 classified information.\n\nBut with numerous intelligence and national security agencies, secret information could go through many hands within the sprawling US defence apparatus, making it susceptible to leakage, experts said.\n\nFor example, although the recently leaked intelligence assessments were meant for the eyes of top officials at the Pentagon, \u201ca lot of people\u201d may have had access to them, Mulroy said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just in the hands of the most senior people. It goes through people who prepare the briefs and staff of multiple senior officials,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nSilbey, the professor, highlighted a dilemma for handling intelligence: The more government officials share information, the more it can boost their understanding of the issues and lead to better decision-making, but it also makes secrets more prone to leaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has seen multiple major leaks and scandals involving classified information in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe US has a weird issue where it both over-classifies things, but also spreads a lot of classified material around very broadly,\u201d Silbey told Al Jazeera.\n\nMulroy said in addition to the investigation into the leaker, he expected a review that will examine \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomebody intentionally stole this information, put it online. And I don\u2019t know why they would do that, but it definitely looks like a crime, and one made to cause serious damage to US national security,\u201d Mulroy said."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Germany approves Poland\u2019s request to send MiG-29 jets to Ukraine", "text": "Ukraine, which hopes to launch a counteroffensive in the coming months, wants fighter jets to defend against air raids.\n\nThe German government has approved Poland\u2019s request to transfer five Soviet-designed MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine defend against the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cI welcome the fact that we in the federal government have reached this decision together,\u201d Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nPoland needs Germany\u2019s consent to send its remaining jets to a third country.\n\nPistorius said the request from Poland had arrived on Thursday, adding that the same-day approval showed that \u201cyou can rely on Germany\u201d.\n\nGermany inherited 24 MiG-29 jets from the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, also widely known as East Germany, during reunification in 1990.

The platform, which allows you to connect accounts linked to game consoles such as PlayStation or Xbox, rapidly carved out a reputation as a niche product for avid gamers.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Discord saw its mainstream popularity skyrocket beyond video-gamers.\n\nThe San Francisco-based site hosts real-time voice, video and text chats for groups and describes itself as a place \u201cwhere you can belong to a school club, a gaming group, or a worldwide art community\u201d.\n\nUsers of Discord can join a server \u2013 or chat room \u2013 by searching for one, accepting an invite, or creating their own. Within each server, members can use single topic-based channels for communication.\n\nHow were the leaks spread on Discord?\n\nIn one of those channels originally created to discuss various topics, members debated the war in Ukraine. According to one member of the chat cited by The Associated Press news agency, an unidentified poster shared documents that the poster claimed were classified.\n\nThe poster would initially mix personal thoughts alongside the documents. Then, as of a few months ago, began uploading images of folded papers.\n\nThe person who said he was a forum member told the AP that another person, identified online only as \u201cLucca\u201d, shared the documents in a different Discord chat.

They also reveal apparent weaknesses in the Ukrainian air defence systems and the size of military battalions.\n\nThey also suggest that the US had penetrated the Russian military forces and the Wagner Group, a mercenary organisation, much more than previously understood.\n\nAnother purported highly classified Pentagon document reveals Russian operatives were building a closer relationship with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which hosts important US military installations. The UAE rejected the allegations, calling them \u201ccategorically false\u201d.\n\nOther leaks have concerned allegations that South Korean leaders were hesitant to ship artillery shells to Ukraine and that Israel\u2019s Mossad spy service opposed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s proposed overhaul of the judiciary.\n\nUS intelligence analysts believed a recent military parade in North Korea \u201cprobably oversells\u201d the threat its intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) pose to the United States, according to another leaked document.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere did the leaks originate?\n\nThe leak may have started on a site called Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games.\n\nThe US Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the incident. Top US officials acknowledge publicly that they are still trying to find answers.\n\n\u201cThey were somewhere in the web, and where exactly, and who had access at that point, we don\u2019t know.

Det er en andel som er fem ganger s\u00e5 h\u00f8y som i andre deler av den tyske h\u00e6ren.\n\nProfessor i internasjonal politikk p\u00e5 Universitet i M\u00fcnchen, Dr. Carlos Masala, sier saken om sersjanten har bidratt til en sv\u00e6rt viktig debatt om holdninger innad i det tyske milit\u00e6ret.\n\n\u2013 Ser man p\u00e5 antall saker sammenlignet med antallet soldater i styrken, er det uten tvil problemer med h\u00f8yreekstremisme i spesialstyrkene. Dette er snakk om sv\u00e6rt godt trente elitesoldater, s\u00e5 det er alarmerende, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-ledelsen har f\u00e5tt beskjed fra tyske myndigheter om at store endringer m\u00e5 gjennomf\u00f8res innen oktober.\n\nOppl\u00f8ste en del av spesialstyrkene\n\nI kj\u00f8lvannet av politiaksjonen mot sersjanten ble det satt ned en komit\u00e9 som skulle unders\u00f8ke utbredelsen av h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger i KSK. Funnene til komiteen f\u00f8rte til at Tysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, i forrige uke ga ledelsen i KSK klar beskjed: Rydd opp i egne rekker innen oktober.\n\n\u2013 KSK kan ikke fortsette i sin n\u00e5v\u00e6rende form, sa Kramp-Karrenbauer p\u00e5 en pressekonferanse.\n\nHun beskrev kulturen i spesialstyrkene som \u00abusunn elitisme\u00bb og med \u00abgiftig lederskap\u00bb, if\u00f8lge BBC.\n\nSpesialstyrkene f\u00e5r ikke dra p\u00e5 internasjonale oppdrag f\u00f8r b\u00e5de rekrutteringen, treningen og ledelsesmetodene har f\u00e5tt en overhaling.\n\nI tillegg kunngjorde forsvarsministeren en reform med drastiske tiltak. Blant annet fjernes en av KSKs fire enheter. Der hadde h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger f\u00e5tt s\u00e5 kraftig fotfeste at det eneste man kunne gj\u00f8re var \u00e5 legge den ned.\n\nTysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, er fast bestemt p\u00e5 \u00e5 f\u00e5 has p\u00e5 h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger innad i landets milit\u00e6rstyrker.\n\nFakta KSK Tysklands elitestyrke med spesialtrente soldater har siden 1996 v\u00e6rt en del av den tyske h\u00e6ren, Bundeswehr. Styrkene fokuserer p\u00e5 operasjoner i forbindelse med antiterror og gisseltagning i farlige omr\u00e5der. Styrkene har blant annet blitt sendt til Afghanistan og Balkan. Operasjonene blir hemmeligholdt. Vis mer\n\nKan v\u00e6re kroken p\u00e5 d\u00f8ren om det ikke gj\u00f8res endringer\n\nDet ble ogs\u00e5 rapportert at spesialstyrkene ikke kunne gj\u00f8re rede for hvor hele 62 kilo med eksplosiver og 48.000 patroner hadde blitt av. Dette var spesielt alarmerende med tanke p\u00e5 funnet i hagen til sersjanten, uttalte Kramp-Karrenbauer. Hun krever n\u00e5 at spesialstyrkene finner ut hvor resten av arsenalet er blitt av.\n\nProfessor Masala tror det kan bli kroken for d\u00f8ren for KSK om man ikke ser konkrete endringer de neste m\u00e5nedene.\n\n\u2013 Vi har en forsvarsminister som er sv\u00e6rt dedikert til saken og \u00f8nsker \u00e5 komme roten av problemet til livs. Hun mener alvor. Jeg tror derfor det vil komme store endringer i styrkene. KSK-ledelsen har ikke noe valg, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-soldat sendte brev om \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb i egen avdeling\n\nAnklager om ekstremisme innad i landets elitestyrke fikk oppmerksomhet allerede i 2017. Da skal flere KSK-soldater ha saluttert med \u00abHitler-hilsen\u00bb og spilt nynazistisk rockemusikk p\u00e5 en avskjedsfest for en av sjefene.\n\nS\u00e5 sent som i juni sendte en ung KSK-soldat brev til forsvarsministeren hvor han innstendig ba henne sette i gang en etterforskning av sin egen avdeling. Han beskrev en \u00abgiftig kultur av aksept\u00bb og \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb,. Ekstreme holdninger blant hans medsoldater ble ignorert, og tidvis, akseptert, if\u00f8lge soldaten, skriver New York Times.\n\nDe tyske spesialstyrkene har i lang tid f\u00e5tt operere frittst\u00e5ende, utenfor resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Det har f\u00f8rt til en form for elitisme, mener eksperter.\n\nElitisme og d\u00e5rlig lederskap preger milj\u00f8et\n\nProfessor Masala mener lojalitet og feilsl\u00e5tt lederskap gj\u00f8r at ekstreme holdninger kan f\u00e5 vokse frem i en tropp med hovedoppgave \u00e5 takle Tysklands farligste oppdrag.\n\n\u2013 Disse spesialstyrkene lever i store perioder helt avsk\u00e5ret fra omverdenen. N\u00e5r man er p\u00e5 hemmelige, livsfarlige oppdrag sammen, er du er n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 kunne stole fullt og helt p\u00e5 sidemannen. Det skaper et helt spesielt b\u00e5nd og lojalitet til hverandre. Det blir en slags milit\u00e6r kult. Da tyster man ikke p\u00e5 hverandre, sier Masala.\n\n\u2013 Du har ogs\u00e5 KSK-ledere som mener milit\u00e6ret og opptrening skal v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt aggressiv og maskulin. I tillegg har KSK frem til n\u00e5 f\u00e5tt operere ganske frittst\u00e5ende fra resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Da utvikler det seg en holdning om at man er mer spesiell enn andre. Mange av soldatene blir i styrken i 15\u201320 \u00e5r, s\u00e5 man f\u00e5r f\u00e5 impulser utenfra, fortsetter professoren.\n\nDet har ogs\u00e5 blitt spekulert i om fremveksten av det h\u00f8yreorienterte partiet Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) p\u00e5 den politiske arenaen, kan linkes til h\u00f8yreekstremisme innad i forsvarsrekkene. I enkelte delstater f\u00e5r det kontroversielle partiet godt over 20 prosent oppslutning.\n\nMasala mener man forel\u00f8pig skal v\u00e6re forsiktig med \u00e5 bruke AfD som en forklarende faktor.\n\n\u2013 Jeg tror hovedproblemet f\u00f8rst og fremst ligger i strukturen til KSK. Det er dette som m\u00e5 endres."}, {"source": "argaam", "title": "\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0629: \u0627\u0646\u062e\u0641\u0627\u0636 \u0645\u0639\u062f\u0644

person in the Western US to have a confirmed infection with a curious bacterium that has lurked in the region for over two decades\u2014and researchers fear the pathogen may finally be emerging there.\n\nThe bacterium is Borrelia miyamotoi, a corkscrew-shaped spirochete that is spread by black-legged ticks and causes a rare disease called hard tick relapsing fever. The spiraled microbe is a relative of the more well-known Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. But B. miyamotoi has many notable differences from its cousin, including its inconspicuous spread.\n\nWhile Lyme disease was first reported in 1975 in the US and B. burgdorferi first identified in 1982, B. miyamotoi was only identified in ticks in 1995 in Japan. But once discovered, it was soon found in many other places, including Europe and many parts of North America. Ticks collected in California as early as 2000 were found to carry the new spirochete, for example. Yet, the first cases of disease caused by B. miyamotoi in the US were only first confirmed in 2013 in the Northeast. Until now, no confirmed cases have been reported in the western part of the country, despite the bacterium's prevalence in adult black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) being similar to that of B. burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete.\n\nShadowy disease\n\nB. miyamotoi disease, or hard tick relapsing fever, is a tricky infection to identify. It is often marked by fevers that come and go, along with nondescript fatigue, chills, and aches and pains. In severe cases, which often affect people with compromised immune systems, the disease can progress to meningoencephalitis, inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissue. But in many cases, the disease resolves on its own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn clinical tests, people infected tend to show low levels of white blood cells and platelets (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), as well as elevated liver enzymes and excess protein in their urine. But there are no simple tests to confirm the disease. Borrelia bacteria share many proteins, so probing for antibodies against the microbe will easily pick up other related bacteria, including the one that causes Lyme disease. The only method to definitively identify a B. miyamotoi infection is to directly probe for fragments of the bacterium's genetic sequence in a person's blood or cerebrospinal fluid, which few laboratories do.\n\nIf an infection is confirmed, there's no well-established treatment. With so few cases clearly identified, researchers have not been able to run clinical trials. But, so far, a two-week course of doxycycline or amoxicillin antibiotics seems to do the trick for most cases, with IV-antibiotic treatments being used in severe cases. A small number of people, however, may experience what's called \"the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction,\" which occurs in the first few hours or days of an antibiotic treatment for spirochete infection. That includes not only B. miyamotoi disease and Lyme disease, but also syphilis, leptospirosis, and others. The reaction is marked by fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, hyperventilation, flushing, and pain. It's unclear exactly what causes this, but researchers hypothesize that as the spirochetes begin to die, they release toxins that spur an acute inflammatory response. The reaction often resolves on its own within a day or so, but it can turn life-threatening for some, and patients need to be monitored closely."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "FTX has recovered $7.3 billion, tells court \u201cthe dumpster fire is out\u201d", "text": "FTX's new leadership has recovered $7.3 billion in assets and is considering whether to restart the cryptocurrency exchange, a company lawyer reportedly said during a hearing at US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware yesterday. The \"$7.3 billion in cash and liquid crypto assets\" is \"an increase of more than $800 million since January,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"The situation has stabilized, and the dumpster fire is out,\" FTX attorney Andy Dietderich said at the hearing. Dietderich was also paraphrased as saying that \"FTX is negotiating with stakeholders about options for restarting its crypto exchange, and it may make a decision on that in the current quarter.\"\n\nFTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is facing 13 criminal charges, is accused of improperly diverting billions of dollars of FTX customer funds to sister company Alameda. Bankman-Fried received about $2.2 billion in payments and loans from FTX entities, FTX said last month. Three other former executives have already pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges.\n\nAccounting mess\n\nThe difficulty of tracking down assets was detailed a few days ago in an interim report filed in court.\n\n\"We sometimes find $50m of assets lying around that we lost track of; such is life,\" Bankman-Fried wrote in an internal message quoted in the report. Bankman-Fried called Alameda \"unauditable\" because \"we are only able to ballpark what its balances are, let alone something like a comprehensive transaction history.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FTX Group had 56 entities that \"did not produce financial statements of any kind,\" while other parts of the corporation \"relied on a hodgepodge of Google documents, Slack communications, shared drives, and Excel spreadsheets and other non-enterprise solutions to manage their assets and liabilities,\" the interim report said.\n\nThe report also detailed security failures such as storing private keys to over $100 million in ethereum assets in plaintext.\n\nReboot details up in the air\n\nFTX's new leadership has said it's trying to figure out how much money it can return to creditors. But in court yesterday, Dietderich \"offered few details on what a reboot [of the crypto exchange] might mean for FTX customers whose crypto deposits have been locked up during the bankruptcy case,\" Reuters wrote.\n\nThere are several questions to be answered before FTX can restart. Reuters wrote:\n\nFTX would need significant capital to restart its crypto exchange, because the existing customer interface had little connection to the movement of money behind the scenes, the lawyer said. \"The app worked beautifully, but in truth it was a facade,\" Dietderich said. It is not clear whether FTX should use its own funds to restart the exchange, rather than using the money to repay customers, Dietderich said. Restarting the exchange might require outside funding or a sale of the exchange's assets.\n\nIn January, FTX's new CEO, John Ray, discussed possibly restarting the exchange. \"Everything is on the table,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. \"If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we'll do it.\"\n\nFTX would examine whether it can return more money to creditors by reviving the exchange than by liquidating or selling all the assets. \"There are stakeholders we're working with who've identified what they see is a viable business,\" Ray said during the January interview."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Microsoft is experimenting with a Steam Deck-friendly \u201chandheld mode\u201d for Windows", "text": "The Steam Deck's default Linux operating system and the Proton translation layer can run a surprising number of PC games well, but to maximize compatibility and flexibility (and to use it like a PC when you're not gaming), installing Windows is always an option. There are also alternate handheld PC designs like the AYA Neo that ship with Windows by default.\n\nBut Windows isn't an ideal operating system for the Steam Deck, at least not out of the box. Its mouse-and-keyboard-oriented user interface isn't comfortable or convenient to use on a small handheld system like the Steam Deck. Windows 11 makes some allowances for touchscreens, but its buttons and menus can still be hard to tap on such a small screen. The controller doesn't work outside of Steam, including on Windows' touchscreen keyboard, and installing drivers and launching games for the first time can be a pain.\n\nMicrosoft is aware of the problems running Windows on the Steam Deck and other similar handheld Windows PCs, and at least some developers inside the company have spent time thinking of ways to address them. That\u2019s the thrust of a leaked presentation (posted in two parts by Twitter user _h0x0d_) about a new \u201cHandheld Mode\u201d for Windows, developed as part of an internal Microsoft hackathon in September 2022.\n\nAs presented, Handheld Mode includes several components: a new first-time setup screen that simplifies driver installation and setup; an improved touchscreen keyboard that fits better on a 7-inch screen and can be controlled Xbox-style with the built-in buttons and joysticks; a simplified Nintendo Switch-esque game launcher; and improved OS-wide controller support thanks to the open source Steamdeck Windows Controller Driver (SWICD) project. The presentation also calls for other changes to Windows' default behaviors, like always opening apps in full-screen mode when in Handheld Mode, better UI scaling for small screens, and \"mapping of controls to common Windows functions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interesting, we have no idea whether Handheld Mode will get buy-in from the rest of the Windows team, and it's not present anywhere in any of the many Windows Insider Preview channels that Microsoft uses to test new features publicly. Windows 11's interface does change in subtle ways when running on a tablet or a convertible PC in tablet mode, but past attempts to graft an entirely separate alternate interface onto Windows\u2014Media Center for TVs, Windows 8's Start screen for tablets\u2014have ended in failure.\n\nStill, the ideas presented are conceptually interesting and thoughtful, and including even basic ideas like better controller support in Windows could meaningfully improve the Steam Deck experience.

The new tires used rubber from a desert shrub called guayule (Parthenium argentatum). Now, Bridgestone is ready to try the rubber in a more practical application and has produced a demonstration run of road-going tires using guayule rubber and a high percentage of recycled materials. The company will conduct tests with automakers to prove the concept.\n\nThe world produces about 2 billion tires each year, and while synthetic rubbers are used in modest amounts, most road tires use a lot of natural rubber from the para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). But 90 percent of para rubber is grown in Southeast Asia and has to be shipped around the world to reach tire factories.\n\nBridgestone has been looking at guayule as an alternative for a little over a decade now. The guayule plant is a short, woody shrub that grows easily in the deserts of the American Southwest and requires much less water than crops like alfalfa or cotton that are also grown there. In Arizona, Bridgestone has been breeding guayule and conducting research and development on its use in tire-making.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than just natural rubber\n\nIn fact, these new tires incorporate more than just guayule rubber. Bridgestone says that 38 percent of the tire's content is biological in origin\u2014there's some para and guayule rubber, but also plant-based oils and resins, biologically derived silica from rice husk ash, and biologically derived carbon black.\n\nAnother 37 percent of the tire's content is from recycled materials. These include recycled steel (for the tire's belt), recycled rubber chemicals, carbon black from both recycled sources and end-of-life tire pyrolysis oil, and synthetic rubber made from sustainable materials like recycled plastic bottles.\n\n\"As we progress in our transformation to a sustainable solutions company, we are making incredible progress in the use of recycled and renewable materials to bring sustainable tire technology from the drawing board to the driveway,\" said Paolo Ferrari, president and CEO of Bridgestone Americas. \"The production and deployment of a 75-percent recycled and renewable materials tire technology marks a significant milestone as we accelerate our progress toward using fully sustainable materials in our products by 2050.\"\n\nBridgestone produced a run of 200 demonstration tires at its Aiken County Passenger/Light Truck Radial Tire Plant in Graniteville, South Carolina, which is the first US tire factory to earn an International Sustainability and Carbon Certification for its transparency and traceability of sustainable raw materials. The plant also uses an eight-acre solar array to help power its operations\u2014tire manufacturing is a very energy-intensive process.\n\nNow the tire company will conduct joint evaluations with automakers to test these tires' suitability for future EVs, and it hopes the good durability of guayule rubber will be well-suited to that application."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "A small town became the center of a QAnon storm.

In March, the only sign that something strange has happened here is the insistence of the groundsman in the local graveyard that he cannot speak to passing journalists.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, this graveyard was overwhelmed with visitors who turned up from out of town to leave flowers and messages of outrage for children buried here, believing they had died at the hands of a satanic pedophile ring involving the prime minister and a Dutch virologist, the Netherlands\u2019 equivalent of Anthony Fauci.\n\nThe conspiracy was a mutation of the QAnon conspiracy, which came out of internet messageboards in the US but has found new life in Europe, piggybacking on local concerns to reach new audiences\u2014with dangerous results. In Germany, 25 people were arrested in December on suspicion of plotting a QAnon-inspired coup to overthrow the country\u2019s government.\n\nHaving found itself at the center of a new conspiracy, the town of Bodegraven turned to the courts to fight back against unfounded accusations of a satanic cover-up. Yesterday, a court in The Hague sentenced Micha Kat, the country\u2019s most famous conspiracy theorist and one of the architects of the libel against Bodegraven, to two and a half years in prison for threats and sedition. His sentencing means all three of the people spearheading this Dutch QAnon offshoot have now been jailed.\n\nKat\u2019s sentencing echoes the case of the US talk show host Alex Jones, who was found liable for defaming the parents of children killed in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, after falsely claiming that the mass shooting was a hoax. The hope is that legal proceedings introduce a chilling effect \u201cin a positive sense,\u201d says Ciar\u00e1n O'Connor, senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate. \u201cOther conspiracy theorists, who engage in dangerous belief systems that might endanger members of the public, might see this action and think twice about spreading lurid conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nThe Bodegraven conspiracy centered around claims made by Joost Knevel, who claimed to remember witnessing a satanic pedophile ring operating in the town when he was a child. \u201cHe initially implicated a local doctor, and it was a local story,\u201d says Sander van der Linden, a professor of psychology at Cambridge University in the UK, who advises governments and companies on how to prevent the spread of misinformation online. But when Knevel teamed up with Kat, a former journalist with a track record of being sued for defamation and making bomb threats, and another conspiracy theorist named Wouter Raatgever, the story morphed to claim that perpetrators also included the country\u2019s prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the head of the Netherlands\u2019 public health institute, Jaap van Dissel, who was at the time the public face of the country\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cThese two other conspiracy theorists helped him craft the narrative in a way that made it really go viral,\u201d says van der Linden.\n\nThe inclusion of more high-profile figures in the story meant the Bodegraven conspiracy more closely echoed the QAnon template, van der Linden adds. Not only did it play into anti-lockdown sentiments circulating at the time, but the idea of mass child abuse was also shocking enough to attract the attention of even ordinary people\u2014prompting the conspiracy to go viral, he adds."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "From the original series to Picard, we\u2019ve ranked every starship Enterprise", "text": "Minor spoilers for this week's Star Trek: Picard are below.\n\nIt's the day Star Trek: Picard fans have been waiting for all season: this week we finally get to Frontier Day! A fleet-wide celebration of the Federation and Starfleet, where everything goes according to plan and nothing surprising happens!\n\nAs part of the festivities, the episode gives us a good look at USS Enterprise-F, a ship which has existed for a decade-plus in Star Trek Online but is only making its first canonical appearance in Picard. It is, depending on how you count, the newest and most advanced version of the Enterprise we've seen in action in any Trek movie or TV show (yes, we talk about the Enterprise-J later).\n\nA new Enterprise means a new opportunity to re-evaluate the many canonical Enterprises that have existed in the last half-century; to that end, we've assembled a completely scientific and objectively correct ranked listing of every starship Enterprise, from the original '60s show to Picard. For good measure, we've also ranked various versions of different Enterprises from reboots, updates, and alternate timelines, plus a few Enterprises that didn't log much screen time but did deserve a quick mention.\n\n#11: Alternate future anti-time Enterprise-D\n\nThe Next Generation has a nearly perfect finale episode, one that nicely wraps up the week-to-week televised adventures of the crew while leaving the door open to what looked like (and, on rare occasions, actually was) a promising movie franchise.\n\nIt also gave us a look at an \"anti-time\" far-future version of the Enterprise-D, where it was still in service after extensive refits rather than being crashed into the surface of a planet. And it... just has a bunch of extra stuff stuck to it? Including a third weird centrally mounted nacelle? It certainly makes it easy to tell the difference between the regular Enterprise and the future Enterprise when they're both in the same shot, but it's just way too busy and slapped-together looking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: The events of Star Trek: Picard are taking place even later than the events of this anti-time future. If anyone sees a Galaxy-class ship with three nacelles flying around, let me know.\n\n#10: Kelvin-timeline Enterprise\n\nThe first of a few different riffs on the original Enterprise that will appear on this list, the J.J. Abrams \"Kelvin-timeline\" version of the Enterprise leaves me cold. I think it's mostly the gigantic, bulbous nacelles, which are each nearly as big as the secondary hull (the part below the saucer with the circular deflector dish attached to the front, for people who don't spend a ton of time on Memory Alpha studying starship designs). They make the whole ship look top-heavy and bug-eyed.\n\nEvery light on the ship is also a glowing whiteish-blue, giving it a monochromatic appearance that just isn't as fun to look at. It's a slick, sterile, Apple Store Enterprise. I don't hate it, but I can't defend it, either.\n\n#9: NX-01 Enterprise\n\nThe retconned \u201cfirst starship Enterprise\u201d is a flat little thing. It does look like an old, simple predecessor of the starships that would come later, and the red tips on the nacelles do a little spinny thing that calls forward to the nacelles on the '60s Enterprise model.\n\nI understand that they couldn't make this forerunner to Kirk's Enterprise look more fancy and advanced than the ship that replaced it, but understanding why the NX-class Enterprise looks the way it does isn\u2019t enough to make me fall in love with it."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Iconic image of M87 black hole just got a machine-learning makeover", "text": "The iconic image of a supermassive black hole in the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy\u2014described by astronomers as a \"fuzzy orange donut\"\u2014was a stunning testament to the capabilities of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). But there were still gaps in the observational data, limiting the resolution the EHT was able to achieve. Now four members of the EHT collaboration have applied a new machine-learning technique dubbed PRIMO (principal-component interferometric modeling) to the original 2017 data, giving that famous image its first makeover. They described their achievement in a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\u201cPRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,\u201d said co-author Tod Lauer (NOIRLab). \u201cIt provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.\u201d\n\nAs we've reported previously, the EHT isn't a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe, including hardware from Hawaii to Europe, and from the South Pole to Greenland, though not all of these were active during the initial observations. The telescope is created by a process called interferometry, which uses light captured at different locations to build an image with a resolution that is the equivalent of a giant telescope (a telescope so big, it\u2019s as if it were as large as the distance between the most distant locations of the individual telescopes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in 2019, the EHT made headlines with its announcement of the first direct image of a black hole, located in the constellation of Virgo, some 55 million light years away. It was a feat that would have been impossible a mere generation ago, made possible by technological breakthroughs, innovative new algorithms, and of course, connecting several of the world's best radio observatories. Science magazine named the image its Breakthrough of the Year.\n\nThe EHT captured photons trapped in orbit around the black hole, swirling around at near the speed of light, creating a bright ring around it. From this, astronomers deduced that the black hole is spinning clockwise. The imaging also revealed the shadow of the black hole, a dark central region within the ring. That shadow is as close as astronomers can get to taking a picture of the actual black hole, from which light cannot escape once it crosses the event horizon. And just as the size of the event horizon is proportional to the black hole's mass, so, too, is the black hole's shadow: the more massive the black hole, the larger the shadow. It was a stunning confirmation of the general theory of relativity, showing that those predictions hold up even in extreme gravitational environments.\n\nTwo years later, the EHT released a new image of the same black hole, this time showing how it looked in polarized light. The ability to measure that polarization for the first time\u2014a signature of magnetic fields at the black hole's edge\u2014yielded fresh insight into how black holes gobble up matter and emit powerful jets from their cores. That polarization enabled astronomers to map the magnetic field lines at the inner edge and to study the interaction between matter flowing in and being blown outward."}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0646\u06d2 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0679\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0646\u0627\u0642\u0635 \u06c1\u06d2: \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u06c1", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0688 \u0631\u06cc\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633 \u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a 22 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0686 \u062a\u06a9 \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0648\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631 \u06c1\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0679 \u0646\u06d2 \u0646\u0646\u06be\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0646\u0628 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u062d\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062c \u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u06af\u0632\u0631\u062a\u06d2 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0632\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u0686\u06cc\u0641 \u062c\u0633\u0679\u0633 \u06a9\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0679\u0633", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06c1 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u06cc\u0648\u0631\u067e\u06cc \u06cc\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2\u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u06af\u0632\u0679 \u067e\u0631\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0637\u06d2\u067e\u0627\u06af\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0627\u06c1\u062f \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u067e\u0631 3\u0645\u0627\u06c1 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u0626\u06d2  \u067e\u0631\u0648\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u067e\u0627\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u062e\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0646 \u067e\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u0631\u06c1\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u06be\u06cc\u06ba", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a: \u063a\u0641\u0644\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06c1\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0633\u067e\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0632\u062e\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0679\u06cc \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0679\u0627\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0648 \u06c1\u06cc \u062a\u06a9\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u06af\u0648\u06af\u0644 \u0627\u067e\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0646 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0648 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u062d \u062f\u06cc\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2\u061f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0641\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0679\u0644\u060c \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06c1 \u0635\u0631\u0641 35 \u0688\u0627\u0644\u0631", "text": ""}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "AP source: Dan Snyder agrees to $6B sale of NFL's Commanders", "text": "FILE - Washington Commanders' Dan Snyder poses for photos during an event to unveil the NFL football team's new identity, Feb. 2, 2022, in Landover, Md.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nDan Snyder has a deal in place to sell the NFL\u2019s Washington Commanders for the biggest price paid for a North American professional sports team.\n\nA group led by Josh Harris and Mitchell Rales that includes Magic Johnson has an agreement in principle to buy the team for a record $6.05 billion, two people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nThe people confirmed the deal was a fully financed, nonexclusive agreement that was not yet signed. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal hasn\u2019t been finalized.\n\nAnother person told The AP a deal hasn\u2019t been sent to the NFL for approval yet. The league declined to comment.\n\nOnce the deal is approved, Harris would own controlling stakes in teams in three of the four major North American pro sports leagues. He and David Blitzer have owned the NBA\u2019s Philadelphia 76ers since 2011 and the NHL\u2019s New Jersey Devils since 2013.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHarris has owned a piece of the Pittsburgh Steelers, which he needs to sell before getting the Commanders.\n\nThe price for the Commanders tops the previous record of $4.65 billion set when Walmart heir Rob Walton\u2019s group bought the Denver Broncos last year. Johnson, the basketball Hall of Famer who also owns part of Major League Baseball\u2019s Los Angeles Dodgers, was also part of Harris\u2019 bid for the Broncos.\n\nRales, co-founder of the Danaher Corp. and a Maryland resident, and Johnson were relatively late additions to the group. Rales and Harris grew up in Bethesda in the Washington suburbs and give the team local ownership roots.\n\nThe sale of the Commanders is pending the execution of a contract and then approval from the rest of the league\u2019s owners, which could happen as soon as their next meeting in Minnesota in May but may take longer. It would need 24 of 32 votes to pass, which is not expected to be a problem after the Broncos sale was unanimously approved and given that Snyder was beginning to fall out of favor with the group.\n\nSnyder bought his boyhood favorite team in 1999 for $750 million and despite mounting criticism repeatedly said he\u2019d never sell. That changed after multiple investigations by the league and Congress into Washington\u2019s workplace misconduct and potential improprieties. The congressional investigation found Snyder played a role in a toxic culture.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIndianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay in October became the first to suggest there was \u201cmerit to remove\u201d Snyder, a nearly unprecedented move that would have also taken a three-quarters majority to happen . Instead, two weeks later, Snyder and wife Tanya hired Bank of America Securities to explore a possible sale of the team.\n\nIt quickly became apparent the Snyders, who bought out the previous minority owners in 2021, were not looking to maintain a controlling interest. Canadian investor Steve Apostolopoulos and Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta were among the other bidders after early interest from Washington-area businessman Todd Boehly and mortgage executive Mat Ishbia, who instead paid $4 billion for the NBA\u2019s Phoenix Suns and WNBA\u2019s Mercury.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe group led by Apostolopoulos was the only other one to submit a fully financed bid.\n\nLawyers representing over 40 former team employees hailed the news of an agreement in principle, saying it \u201cmarks the end of a long, difficult chapter\u201d for their clients and fans. Lisa Banks and Debra Katz welcomed the new owners and said they \u201chope a new chapter can truly begin\u201d within the organization.\n\nHarris and Rales will soon assume control of a once-storied franchise that has fallen far from its 1980s and early \u201990s glory days, when Washington won the Super Bowl three times. With Snyder in charge, the team made the playoffs just six times in 24 seasons, only twice won a postseason game and went 166-226-2 overall.\n\nThe new owners will inherit coach Ron Rivera, who has run Washington\u2019s football operations for three seasons, none with a winning record , including an NFC East title at 7-9 in 2020 followed by a first-round loss.\n\nTheir biggest immediate challenge for the long-term future of the organization is a new stadium to replace FedEx Field, the rushed-to-completion home of the team since 1997 in Landover, Maryland, that has not aged well. Virginia abandoned a stadium bill last spring given the number of off-field controversies swirling around the team.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGetting fans back is a major priority after Washington ranked last in the league in attendance in 2022 and were second-last in 2021. The team rebranded last year as the Commanders after dropping the name Redskins in the summer of 2020 and going by the Washington Football Team for two seasons.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what latitude Harris and Rales might have to make their own changes to the team name, logo or other aspects of design, or if they have any interest in changing course when they take over.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Pitcher criticizes MLB teams for extending alcohol sales", "text": "A baseball fan looks at the offerings in a beer cooler at PNC Park before a baseball game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Houston Astros in Pittsburgh, Wednesday, April 12, 2023.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 A pitcher with the Philadelphia Phillies is criticizing some Major League Baseball teams for extending alcohol sales with games running around 30 minutes shorter due to the sport\u2019s new pitch clock .\n\nMatt Strahm said Thursday on the Baseball Isn\u2019t Boring podcast that teams should be moving the cutoff for beer sales up to the sixth inning, rather than stretching to the eighth or later , since fans will have less time to sober up and drive home.\n\nAt least five teams \u2014 the Houston Astros, Arizona Diamondbacks, Texas Rangers, Minnesota Twins and Milwaukee Brewers \u2014 have extended alcohol sales past the traditional seventh-inning cutoff. The Baltimore Orioles had already allowed sales into the eighth.\n\nOther teams haven\u2019t ruled out changes.\n\n\u201cThe reason we stopped it in the seventh before was to give our fans time to sober up and drive home safe, correct?\u201d Strahm said. \u201cSo now with a faster pace game, and me just being a man of common sense, if the game is going to finish quicker, would we not move the beer sales back to the sixth inning to give our fans time to sober up and drive home?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cInstead, we\u2019re going to the eighth, and now you\u2019re putting our fans and our family at risk driving home with people who have just drank beers 22 minutes ago.\u201d\n\nStrahm suggested team owners should re-evaluate whether the extension of beer sales looks out for the safety of fans, or whether it\u2019s a \u201cway to make their dollars back.\u201d\n\nThrough the first 1 1/2 weeks of the season, the average MLB game time has been down 31 minutes because of the rule changes, particularly the new pitch clock.\n\nThat means fans are spending less time \u2014 and perhaps less money \u2014 at stadiums.\n\nFor the nonprofit Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the extension of beer sales doesn\u2019t change much. The goal remains keeping drunk people off the road.\n\n\u201cIf it cuts off sales in the seventh inning, the eighth inning or the ninth inning, that really doesn\u2019t affect our stance because regardless, we just don\u2019t want people to drink alcohol and then drive home from the game,\u201d Erin Payton, regional executive director of MADD, told The Associated Press in a statement.\n\nYankees reliever Michael King also believes \u201cthere\u2019s a responsibility on everybody\u201d to prevent drunk driving, \u201cregardless if you\u2019re getting served in the seventh or eighth inning.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Astros were the latest team to announce an extension of alcohol sales. The team said Thursday fans would be able to purchase alcohol at limited locations through the end of the game.\n\nThe Rangers allowed some alcohol sales in the eighth inning last season, but have made that option more widely available in 2023. The team said the move to offer in-seat service to everyone \u2014 fans can order on their phones \u2014 was done partly in reaction to the pitch clock and the potential of shorter game times so fans would not have to miss extended action waiting in lines at concession stands.\n\nBrewers President of business operations Rick Schlesinger confirmed to MLB.com that their team\u2019s move to extend alcohol sales through the eighth was an experiment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that this is causing an issue or we feel that it might cause an issue, then we\u2019ll revert to what we have done previously,\u201d Schlesinger said.\n\nMLB says it does not regulate when teams sell alcohol. Most franchises have used the seventh inning as a cutoff, at least partly to avoid overserving customers who could then get in their cars and drive home.\n\nBut in reality, most teams already had areas around the ballpark where fans could get alcohol after the seventh, even if the concession stands stopped serving. Many parks are connected to restaurants or have VIP areas where the booze still flows.\n\n___\n\nFreelancer Larry Fleisher contributed.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Jury selection begins in defamation lawsuit against Fox News", "text": "FILE - A headline about President Donald Trump is displayed outside Fox News studios in New York on Nov. 28, 2018.

There were questions, too, concerning Mike Lindell , the MyPillow CEO who has helped spread conspiracy theories related to voting machines.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNews habits were a key focus of the questionnaire given to potential jurors, who were asked whether they regularly watch or avoid Fox News programs and whether that would affect their ability to be fair and impartial.\n\nDavis had made clear that the selection process would be done out of public view to ensure the privacy and safety of potential jurors.\n\n\u201cBecause of the nature of the case and under the statute, I can take those steps to protect jurors,\u201d the judge said, noting the case has received international attention.\n\n\u201cI need to make sure that the jury remains unaffected by this,\u201d Davis added.\n\nJury selection in Delaware is usually done in public but occasionally is closed, such as in high-profile criminal cases or those involving alleged gang activity.\n\nOn Thursday morning, the judge met privately with potential jurors and handed out forms asking several routine questions, including whether those in the jury pool have ever worked for, or know anyone who has worked for Fox or Dominion Voting Systems , the Colorado-based voting machine company that filed the defamation lawsuit .\n\nThey also were asked whether they know any of the potential witnesses for the trial , a list of nearly 120 names.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDavis previously rejected a request by lawyers for Dominion to ask potential jurors whether they believe the 2020 presidential election may have been stolen or illegitimate or whether President Joe Biden was fraudulently elected.\n\nDominion also unsuccessfully sought to have jurors questioned on whether they agreed that the company committed fraud by rigging the election or that Dominion\u2019s software and algorithms manipulated vote counts.\n\nDavis also didn\u2019t allow questions related to some of the claims aired on Fox in the weeks after the election, including whether jurors agreed that Dominion is owned by a company founded in Venezuela to rig elections for the late strongman Hugo Ch\u00e1vez or that it paid kickbacks to government officials who used its machines that year.\n\nDominion is suing Fox for $1.6 billion, alleging it damaged the company by repeatedly airing such allegations. Internal Fox communications produced as part of the lawsuit show that many Fox executives and on-air hosts didn\u2019t believe the claims but broadcast them anyway.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe judge began Thursday\u2019s proceeding by denying a request by certain media outlets for permission to record and rebroadcast a live audio feed of the trial. The outlets sought similar permission for the jury selection, even though it is being done in private without audio access.\n\nDavis told lawyers and media representatives in the courtroom that even providing an audio feed of the trial is unprecedented.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting the most access of any media in a Superior Court case in Delaware,\u201d he said.\n\nThe trial is expected to last six weeks."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Actor Drake Bell found safe after being declared missing", "text": "FILE - Drake Bell appears at the world premiere of \"The Spy Who Dumped Me\" in Los Angeles on July 25, 2018.

Momeni was taken into custody Thursday morning in Emeryville, a San Francisco suburb, and booked on suspicion of murder.\n\nThe stabbing death of Lee shocked the tech industry, with friends and former colleagues mourning the demise of a brilliant and generous man. Police found Lee with stab wounds in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco at 2:30 a.m. April 4. He died at a hospital.\n\nScott declined to give details on how they linked the killing to Momeni. The chief also refused to disclose a possible motive. Investigators served search warrants in San Francisco and Emeryville. Scott would not say whether a weapon has been found.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said in a statement that Momeni has been charged with murder in Lee\u2019s death and is expected to be arraigned Friday. Prosecutors will ask a judge to hold him without bail, she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether Momeni has an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nOn his LinkedIn profile, Momeni describes himself as an \u201cIT Consultant/Entrepreneur\u201d as well as the owner of a company called Expand IT. Business filings with the state list Momeni as the chief executive officer, secretary and chief financial officer of Expand IT INC, described as an information technology consulting business.

Singer described Momeni as \u201cvery welcoming, warm\u201d and his loft as a \u201ctypical Bay Area technology consultant\u2019s office\u201d with a big pool table, gourmet food and high-end stereo system.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLee is known for creating the widely used mobile payment service Cash App while working as chief technology officer of the payment company Square, now known as Block . He was the chief product officer for the cryptocurrency firm MobileCoin at the time of his death.\n\nLee was raised in Missouri and had recently moved to Miami with his father, but was back in San Francisco for business when he was killed.

Attorney General Merrick Garland said he is to be charged with removing or transmitting classified national defense information, a crime under the Espionage Act.\n\nGarland did not reveal a possible motive, but accounts of those in the online private chat group where the documents were disclosed have depicted Teixeira as motivated more by bravado than ideology.\n\nWhile Thursday\u2019s arrest was a pivotal moment in an investigation into the highest-profile intelligence leak in years , the military and Justice Department were still scrutinizing how sensitive government secrets shared in a chat room ended up circulating around the world. The emergence of Teixeira as a primary suspect is bound to raise questions about how such a profound breach, one that the Pentagon termed a \u201cvery serious risk to national security,\u201d could have been caused by such a young, low-ranking service member.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe entrust our members with a lot of responsibility at a very early age. Think about a young combat platoon sergeant, and the responsibility and trust that we put into those individuals to lead troops into combat,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman.\n\nTeixeira was a \u201ccyber transport systems specialist,\u201d essentially an IT specialist responsible for military communications networks, including their cabling and hubs. In that role Teixeira would have had a higher level of security clearance because he would have also been tasked with responsibility for ensuring protection for the networks, a defense official told The Associated Press, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nHours after the arrest, Rep. Mike Turner, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement pledging to \u201cexamine why this happened, why it went unnoticed for weeks, and how to prevent future leaks.\u201d\n\nTeixeira, who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts at the time heavily armed tactical agents took him into custody, is due to have his initial court appearance in Massachusetts on Friday. He could also face charges in a military court.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf, and a phone message left at a number believed to belong to his mother was not returned.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGarland said the investigation is ongoing, but did not say if other suspects were being pursued.\n\nThe Biden administration has scrambled to contain the potential diplomatic and military fallout from the leaks since they were first reported last week, moving to assure allies and assess the scope of damage. Pentagon officials have expressed alarm about the breach. President Joe Biden downplayed the lasting impact of the revelations, telling reporters in Ireland earlier Thursday that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing contemporaneous that I\u2019m aware of that is of great consequence.\u201d\n\nThe classified documents \u2014 which have not been individually authenticated by U.S. officials \u2014 range from briefing slides mapping out Ukrainian military positions to assessments of international support for Ukraine and other sensitive topics, including under what circumstances Russian President Vladimir Putin might use nuclear weapons.\n\nThere\u2019s no clear answer on how many documents were leaked. The Associated Press has viewed approximately 50 documents; some estimates put the total number in the hundreds.\n\nThe leak is believed to have started on a site called Discord, a social media platform popular with people playing online games and where Teixeira is believed to have posted for years about guns, games and his favorite memes \u2014 and, according to some chatting with him, closely guarded U.S. secrets.\n\nThe investigative website Bellingcat and The New York Times first publicly identified Teixeira, minutes before federal officials confirmed he was a subject of interest in the investigation. They reported tracking profiles on other more obscure sites linked to Teixeira.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn previous Associated Press stories, the leaker was identified as \u201cthe O.G.\u201d by a member of the online chat group. The person declined to give his name to the AP, citing concerns for his personal safety.\n\nThe chat group, called Thug Shaker Central, drew roughly two dozen enthusiasts who talked about their favorite types of guns and also shared memes and jokes, some of them racist. The group also held a running discussion on wars that included talk of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn that discussion, \u201cthe O.G.\u201d would for months post material that he said was classified \u2014 originally typing it out with his own notations, then a few months ago switching to posting images of folded-up papers because he felt his writings weren\u2019t being taken seriously, the person said.\n\nDiscord has said it was cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin, in a statement issued after the arrest, said the Pentagon would conduct a review of its \u201cintelligence access, accountability and control procedures\u201d to prevent such a leak from happening again.\n\nThere are only a few ways the classified information that was leaked could have been accessed. Typically in classified briefings with slides like those that were placed on Discord, the information is shared electronically. That can be done either through secure computer terminals where users gain access based on their credentials or through tablets that are distributed for briefings and collected later.\n\nIf the slides need to be printed out instead, they can only be sent to secured printers that are able to handle classified documents \u2014 and that keep a digital record of everyone who has requested a printout.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor those with a security clearance, their handling of classified material is based largely on training and trust that they will safeguard the information.\n\n\u201cWhen you join the military, depending on your position, you may require a security clearance,\u201d Ryder said. \u201cAnd if you are working in the intelligence community, and you require a security clearance, you\u2019re going to go through the proper vetting.\u201d\n\nRyder said each service member who obtains a clearance signs a non-disclosure agreement and is trained on the military\u2019s strict guidelines for handling classified material. The leaks were \u201ca deliberate criminal act, a violation of those guidelines.\u201d\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle R.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department said Thursday that it will again go to the Supreme Court over abortion after a lower court ruling allowed the abortion pill mifepristone to remain available in the U.S. but reimposed past restrictions on getting and using the drug.\n\nAt stake in the accelerating court battle that began in Texas is widespread access to the most common method of abortion in the U.S., less than a year after the reversal of Roe v. Wade prompted more than a dozen states to effectively ban abortion outright.\n\nIn a ruling late Wednesday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans temporarily narrowed a ruling by a lower court judge in Texas that had completely blocked the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone. But a divided three-judge panel still reduced the period of pregnancy when the drug can be taken and said it could not be dispensed by mail.\n\nThe ruling preventing the pill from being sent by mail amounts to another significant constraint of abortion access that could be felt even in states where abortion remains legal, some of which have already begun stockpiling mifepristone over worries that the drug will become unavailable.\n\nThe Justice Department said it would ask the U.S. Supreme Court for an emergency order to stop the lower court ruling from taking effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe are going to continue to fight in the courts, we believe the law is on our side, and we will prevail,\u201d White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Thursday, speaking from Dublin during a visit by President Joe Biden.\n\nMifepristone was approved by the FDA more than two decades ago and is used in combination with a second drug, misoprostol.\n\nAbortion rights groups expressed both relief over FDA approval remaining in place and outrage over the appeals court reinstating restrictions. Whole Woman\u2019s Health, an abortion provider that operates six clinics in five states, said in a tweet it was continuing to offer mifepristone in clinics and through virtual services while reviewing the decision.\n\nIn the 2-1 decision, the judges put on hold changes made by the regulator since 2016 that relaxed the rules for prescribing and dispensing mifepristone. Those included extending the period of pregnancy when the drug can be used from seven weeks to 10 and allowing it to be dispensed by mail, without any need to visit a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe panel\u2019s decision came just days after the Justice Department appealed last week\u2019s far-reaching ruling out of Texas that blocked the FDA\u2019s approval of the pill. The lawsuit was filed by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group that also argued to overturn Roe v. Wade, and is representing a group of anti-abortion doctors.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere is virtually no precedent for a lone judge overturning the regulator\u2019s medical decisions.\n\nAttorneys for the plaintiffs indicated Thursday that they were content with the court\u2019s order and did not plan to seek an appeal that might restore the Texas court\u2019s full ruling.\n\n\u201cThe 5th Circuit\u2019s decision is a significant victory for the doctors we represent, women\u2019s health, and every American who deserves an accountable federal government acting within the bounds of the law,\u201d said Erin Hawley, an attorney for Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe two judges who voted to tighten restrictions, Kurt Engelhardt and Andrew Oldham, are both appointees of former President Donald Trump. The third judge, Catharina Haynes, is an appointee of former President George W. Bush. She said she would have put the lower court ruling on hold entirely for now to allow oral arguments in the case.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, a separate federal judge in Washington state last week ordered the FDA not to do anything that might block mifepristone\u2019s availability in 17 Democrat-led states suing to keep it on the market. The judge in that case clarified Thursday that his order requires the FDA to keep access the same as it was in January in those states, leaving the agency facing conflicting court orders.\n\n\u201cThis is just as much of a binding court order as whatever comes out of Texas,\u201d said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.\n\nThe New Orleans appeals court judges in the majority in Wednesday\u2019s decision noted that the Biden administration and mifepristone\u2019s manufacturer \u201cwarn us of significant public consequences\u201d that would result if mifepristone were withdrawn entirely from the market under the lower court ruling.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the judges suggested FDA changes making mifepristone easier to obtain since 2016 were less consequential than its initial approval of the drug in 2000. It would be \u201cdifficult\u201d to argue the changes were \u201cso critical to the public given that the nation operated \u2014 and mifepristone was administered to millions of women \u2014 without them for 16 years\u201d the judges wrote.\n\nWhen the drug was initially approved, the FDA limited its use to up to seven weeks of pregnancy. It also required three in-person office visits: the first to administer mifepristone, the next to administer the second drug, misoprostol, and the third to address any complications. It also required a doctor\u2019s supervision and a reporting system for any serious consequences of the drug.\n\nIf the appeals court\u2019s action stands, those would again be the terms under which mifepristone could be dispensed for now.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDemocratic leaders in states where abortion remains legal since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year say they are preparing in case mifepristone becomes restricted. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Tuesday that her state would stockpile 150,000 doses of misoprostol.\n\nThe White House also has contingency plans in place, but Jean-Pierre held off detailing them while legal action continued. Instead, she described a proposed new federal rule to limit how law enforcement and state officials collect medical records if they investigate women who flee their home states to seek abortions elsewhere.\n\nAt the core of the Texas lawsuit is the allegation that the FDA\u2019s initial approval of mifepristone was flawed because the agency did not adequately review safety risks.\n\nMifepristone has been used by millions of women over the past 23 years. While less drastic than completely overturning the drug\u2019s approval, the latest ruling still represents a stark challenge to the FDA\u2019s authority overseeing how prescription drugs are used in the U.S. The panel overturned multiple decisions made by FDA regulators after years of scientific review.\n\nCommon side effects with mifepristone include cramping, bleeding, nausea, headache and diarrhea. In rare cases, women can experience excess bleeding that requires surgery to stop.\n\nStill, in loosening restrictions on mifepristone, FDA regulators cited \u201cexceedingly low rates of serious adverse events.\u201d\n\nMore than 5.6 million women in the U.S. had used the drug as of June 2022, according to the FDA. In that period, the agency received 4,200 reports of complications in women, or less than one-tenth of 1% of women who took the drug.\n\n___\n\nGresko reported from Washington.

The move exasperated Democrats, who immediately pointed out that cutting off debate and silencing dissenters was what led the so-called Tennessee three to break House rules after being cut off from previous debates.\n\nThe Nashville Metropolitan Council took only a few minutes Monday to restore Jones to office. He was quickly reinstated to his House seat that day.\n\nThe appointments are interim, though both Jones and Pearson plan to run in special elections for the seats later this year.\n\nThe House\u2019s vote to remove Pearson and Jones but keep white state Rep.

The scene unfolded days after the shooting at the Covenant School, a private Christian school.

(April 13)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Former President Donald Trump answered questions for nearly seven hours Thursday during his second deposition in a legal battle with New York\u2019s attorney general over his company\u2019s business practices , reversing an earlier decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and remain silent.\n\nThe Republican met all day with lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump last year. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his family misled banks and business associates by giving them false information about his net worth and the value of assets such as hotels and golf courses.\n\nShortly after Trump entered the Manhattan skyscraper that houses James\u2019 offices, his attorney, Alina Habba, said he was \u201cnot only willing but also eager to testify.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAfter the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump\u2019s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours \u201cdescribing in detail his extraordinary business success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,\u201d Kise said. \u201cWhen the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment , the first for a former president.\n\nJames declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.\n\nTrump previously met with James\u2019 lawyers Aug. 10 , but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.\n\n\u201cAnyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,\u201d he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly.

The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.\n\nIn a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit \u201cridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.\u201d\n\nHe raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general\u2019s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.\n\nThe lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October.

The government may want to redefine casual work in the wake of a 2021 High Court ruling in the Rossato case.

The level of casual employment has not changed for 30 years, sitting between 21 per cent and 25 per cent of the workforce. In August, 23.5 per cent of employees worked casually. Relatively few workers have taken up the option of converting to full time because they prefer the higher pay over holidays and other benefits, and the freedom to quickly move on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Albanese government has also promised that it will force so-called same work, same pay rules onto labour hire companies used by major employers like BHP and Qantas.

Pendal estimates the headline number could fall in a range of 1 per cent to 1.8 per cent because of the difficulty in predicting utility prices.\n\nThe interbank futures market pushed back the timing of speculated interest rate cuts to May next year, from March before the data.\n\nBut Vimal Gor, chief investment officer at Trovio, believes it will happen sooner.\n\n\u201cIn line with the US, the RBA has over-tightened interest rates and the next move will be material cuts later this year and next,\u201d he said.\n\nUS inflation growth slowed to just 0.1 per cent in March, giving the Federal Reserve some breathing room, but not enough to prevent another US rate rise in May. The headline consumer price index rose 5 per cent in annual terms, down from 6 per cent in February, representing the smallest year-on-year gain since May 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClosing in\n\nMinutes from the Fed\u2019s March meeting also showed some policymakers considered pausing interest rate increases, before agreeing to last month\u2019s 0.25 percentage point rise.\n\nThat, combined with the softening in inflation, suggested the US tightening cycle is nearing its end.\n\nFed funds futures imply a 71 per cent chance of just one more increase in May to a range of 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent. Rate cuts are expected by November.\n\nMr Gor is pessimistic about the US economy, disputing the Fed\u2019s view that the turmoil in regional banks is contained: \u201cThe US economy is experiencing a credit crunch and this should result in significant rate cuts later this year.\u201d"}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "Anthony Albanese: NATO visit should be a slam dunk for the prime minister", "text": "In one respect, China\u2019s hand had been forced. Australian and Chinese officials received late last month the WTO panel\u2019s ruling on the case, which was due to be made public any day. By offering to do a review and gaining Australia\u2019s acquiescence to pause the WTO challenge, China avoids a potentially adverse ruling.\n\nWhile coal was by far the biggest by dollar value of the commodities hit by China\u2019s trade sanctions against $20 billion of Australian goods when the bilateral relationship soured, barley was highly symbolic.\n\nAny excuse to sit around the same table as the US, UK, France and Germany should not be sneezed at.\n\nBarley was the first product to feel China\u2019s wrath, with tariffs imposed on May 18, 2020, one day short of a month since then-foreign minister Marise Payne declared the Morrison government\u2019s push to set up an international inquiry into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tariffs on wine soon followed, as did de facto bans on other goods including beef, lobsters, timber and coal.\n\nChina\u2019s had kept its \u201cgrievance\u201d over barley in its back pocket for some time. An investigation into claims barley had been dumped was initiated in 2018, giving China the cover to go ahead with its tariffs.\n\nThe second positive gesture from China this week was the visit to Sydney and Canberra by Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu, a former ambassador to Australia. Ma is the most senior Chinese official to meet visit Australia since then-premier Li Keqiang came in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Ma has the rank of vice minister, within the Chinese system he is a bureaucrat rather than politician. That\u2019s why he was here for officials-level talks, including with DFAT secretary Jan Adams, rather than to meet Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\nThe visit and movement over tariffs vindicates the \u201cstabilisation\u201d approach taken by Anthony Albanese, Trade Minister Don Farrell and Wong. Dialogue has resumed at both political and bureaucratic levels, while Australia has remained firm on issues such as foreign investment, the Pacific and AUKUS.\n\nDespite successfully lowering the temperature with China, a suggestion Albanese may not accept an invitation to attend the NATO summit in July is worrying.\n\nBizarrely, Albanese\u2019s office is not commenting on whether he will accept NATO\u2019s invitation following The Sydney Morning Herald\u2019s story, even though the answer can only be \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, or \u201cstill under consideration\u201d.\n\nIt would be a mistake for Albanese not to go, for a myriad of reasons. First, it would go against the deliberate foreign policy thrust Australia has embraced in recent years to build a web or network of alliances and partnerships.\n\nWhether it is reinvigorating the Quad, keeping Trans-Pacific Partnership going, creating AUKUS or patching up the Pacific Islands Forum, it\u2019s in Australia\u2019s interest to participate in minilateral and multilateral bodies where possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlbanese\u2019s attendance at the NATO summit would be the second year running Australia has been invited, alongside fellow Asia-Pacific nations Japan, South Korea and New Zealand. If we don\u2019t show up, we\u2019ll stop getting asked.\n\nLook at the G7. Albanese\u2019s attendance at the Hiroshima meeting next month would be the third time in four years an Australian leader has been a participant. It\u2019s almost at the stage where if Australia didn\u2019t get invited in the future it would be disappointing, especially given the ambitions of some to turn the body into the D-10, D standing for democracy.\n\nAny excuse to sit around the same table as the US, UK, France and Germany should not be sneezed at. NATO also offers the opportunity to get to know the leaders of Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nThis year\u2019s NATO summit has added salience given the ongoing war in Ukraine. Hosting it in Lithuania, which borders both the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, will put pressure on leaders to continue to send arms to Ukraine. Australia, as a major donor, has a stake in those discussions.\n\nArguably the most important reason for Albanese to go is shore up the stance of Indo-Pacific leaders that stability in our region matters to Europe, too.\n\nEmmanuel Macron\u2019s comments this week about not being a US vassal following his visit to China have been subject of much debate. Some analysts argue the way they have been interpreted has been a literal case of lost in translation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNevertheless, it has created a perception at least that France, and by extension perhaps Europe, is wobbly over China and Taiwan. Macron appeared to dismiss the fate of Taiwan as none of Europe\u2019s business.\n\nSuch a sentiment plays into China\u2019s demands for non-interference in \u201cdomestic\u201d matters. And while there is little European forces would be able to do militarily to repel an invasion of Taiwan in the opening days of conflict, the US, Japan and Australia would look to the continent to buttress any sanctions.\n\nThere may be some reluctance to go to NATO because Albanese has a busy travel schedule this year. He has already been to Papua New Guinea, India and the US, and will head to London next month for the coronation.\n\nPost budget, Albanese will head to the G7 in Japan, then host the Quad leaders meeting in Sydney on May 23-24 (strangely, his office is yet to confirm those dates, although Indian media is reporting it as fact and preparations are under way in Canberra to welcome Joe Biden and the large presidential entourage).\n\nHe also has PIF in the Cook Islands (now a must for a PM), Singapore to speak at a security conference, the G20 and APEC. Throw in a potential United Nations visit, a China trip and other bilaterals.\n\nBut Europe has over the past few years woken up to the challenge China poses to the international rules-based order.

Funnene til komiteen f\u00f8rte til at Tysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, i forrige uke ga ledelsen i KSK klar beskjed: Rydd opp i egne rekker innen oktober.\n\n\u2013 KSK kan ikke fortsette i sin n\u00e5v\u00e6rende form, sa Kramp-Karrenbauer p\u00e5 en pressekonferanse.\n\nHun beskrev kulturen i spesialstyrkene som \u00abusunn elitisme\u00bb og med \u00abgiftig lederskap\u00bb, if\u00f8lge BBC.\n\nSpesialstyrkene f\u00e5r ikke dra p\u00e5 internasjonale oppdrag f\u00f8r b\u00e5de rekrutteringen, treningen og ledelsesmetodene har f\u00e5tt en overhaling.\n\nI tillegg kunngjorde forsvarsministeren en reform med drastiske tiltak.

Dette var spesielt alarmerende med tanke p\u00e5 funnet i hagen til sersjanten, uttalte Kramp-Karrenbauer. Hun krever n\u00e5 at spesialstyrkene finner ut hvor resten av arsenalet er blitt av.\n\nProfessor Masala tror det kan bli kroken for d\u00f8ren for KSK om man ikke ser konkrete endringer de neste m\u00e5nedene.\n\n\u2013 Vi har en forsvarsminister som er sv\u00e6rt dedikert til saken og \u00f8nsker \u00e5 komme roten av problemet til livs. Hun mener alvor.

I tillegg har KSK frem til n\u00e5 f\u00e5tt operere ganske frittst\u00e5ende fra resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Da utvikler det seg en holdning om at man er mer spesiell enn andre.

Are they accurate? Who leaked them? And why?\n\nDespite growing questions, experts seemed to agree on one thing: The leaks are damaging to Washington\u2019s intelligence-gathering and foreign policy.\n\nThe documents include details of the Western military support to Ukraine, information about Russia\u2019s war effort and intelligence collected from allied states.\n\nUS officials have not denied the validity of the documents, acknowledging that they \u201cpresent a very serious risk to national security\u201d and appear to be real, though in some cases altered. But they warned that the leaks \u201chave the potential to spread disinformation\u201d.\u200b\n\nAnalysts have said the leaks risk exposing intelligence sources and could cause a diplomatic headache for Washington.\n\nMick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official who also served in the CIA, called the leak \u201cdamaging\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think the United States needs to do a better job of securing classified information,\u201d Mulroy said.\n\nThe \u201cbiggest concern\u201d, he added, is the possible compromising of methods of intelligence-gathering, including human sources. Mulroy stressed the importance of the \u201cability to protect our assets, protect our way of doing business, so we know information that goes into making policy\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the intelligence assessments \u2014 which were meant for senior officials at the Pentagon \u2014 did not include the names of possible human sources, experts said the revelations could help US adversaries, particularly Russia, identify American assets in their midst.\n\nGlenn Carle, a former senior US intelligence official, described the leak as a failure \u201cof major magnitude\u201d that \u201csome people may well die from\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny counter-intelligence service will be hastily and thoroughly now working out who has access to that information in their country and reducing the number of possible individuals,\u201d Carle told Al Jazeera\u2019s Inside Story.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s quite possible that they could identify the sources \u2014 and depending on the country, that will damage or destroy their career or get them killed.\u201d\n\nCarle said the leaks were an \u201cunfolding disaster\u201d because intelligence agents have the \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d to protect their sources, which could be harmed by the slightest breach.\n\n\u2018Embarrassing\u2019\n\nThe leaked secret documents started making headlines earlier this month, after spreading in some obscure corners of the internet weeks before that. The Pentagon and the Department of Justice are investigating the issue.\n\nA Washington Post report published late on Wednesday traced the files to a single poster in a private server on the online platform Discord. The user, known as OG, told friends that he works on a military base, the newspaper reported.\n\nDavid Silbey, an associate professor at Cornell University who specialises in defence policy and military history, said the fact that the documents were first posted on a private forum indicated that the supposed leaker did not aim to widely spread the information.\n\n\u201cOne of the strange things about the leaks from the very beginning was that this was a really odd place for them to show up,\u201d Silbey told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cIf it had been a sort of espionage act, why put them on a random Discord server? You wouldn\u2019t reveal it publicly anyway; you\u2019d just pass it back to Russia. If it was a leak to share with the public, it\u2019s about the worst possible way to leak it.\u201d\n\nHe added that the leaker seemed to be \u201cshowing off\u201d. But regardless of the intent, the leak remains \u201csignificant\u201d, Silbey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe documents reveal that the US has insider accounts from some countries it considers partners, including South Korea and Egypt, suggesting that Washington could be spying on its allies.\n\nFor example, in South Korea, an opposition leader has called on Seoul to \u201csternly respond to the spying of state secrets\u201d after the leaks.\n\n\u201cIt can cause risks in relationships with our allies, which according to these things, we also collected [intelligence] on; that\u2019s going to be a diplomatic rift,\u201d said Mulroy, the former Pentagon official.\n\nHe added that, while any feud with partners may be repaired quickly because \u201cmany countries collect information on even their friends\u201d, it is still \u201cembarrassing\u201d when that notion becomes public.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nGovernments around the world closely guard information of this nature. US law makes it a crime to divulge \u2014 or even mishandle \u2014 classified information.\n\nBut with numerous intelligence and national security agencies, secret information could go through many hands within the sprawling US defence apparatus, making it susceptible to leakage, experts said.\n\nFor example, although the recently leaked intelligence assessments were meant for the eyes of top officials at the Pentagon, \u201ca lot of people\u201d may have had access to them, Mulroy said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just in the hands of the most senior people. It goes through people who prepare the briefs and staff of multiple senior officials,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nSilbey, the professor, highlighted a dilemma for handling intelligence: The more government officials share information, the more it can boost their understanding of the issues and lead to better decision-making, but it also makes secrets more prone to leaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has seen multiple major leaks and scandals involving classified information in recent years.\n\n\u201cThe US has a weird issue where it both over-classifies things, but also spreads a lot of classified material around very broadly,\u201d Silbey told Al Jazeera.\n\nMulroy said in addition to the investigation into the leaker, he expected a review that will examine \u201cwhat went wrong\u201d.\n\n\u201cSomebody intentionally stole this information, put it online. And I don\u2019t know why they would do that, but it definitely looks like a crime, and one made to cause serious damage to US national security,\u201d Mulroy said."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Germany approves Poland\u2019s request to send MiG-29 jets to Ukraine", "text": "Ukraine, which hopes to launch a counteroffensive in the coming months, wants fighter jets to defend against air raids.\n\nThe German government has approved Poland\u2019s request to transfer five Soviet-designed MiG-29 fighter jets to help Ukraine defend against the Russian invasion.\n\n\u201cI welcome the fact that we in the federal government have reached this decision together,\u201d Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nPoland needs Germany\u2019s consent to send its remaining jets to a third country.\n\nPistorius said the request from Poland had arrived on Thursday, adding that the same-day approval showed that \u201cyou can rely on Germany\u201d.\n\nGermany inherited 24 MiG-29 jets from the German Democratic Republic, or GDR, also widely known as East Germany, during reunification in 1990.

The spiraled microbe is a relative of the more well-known Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. But B. miyamotoi has many notable differences from its cousin, including its inconspicuous spread.\n\nWhile Lyme disease was first reported in 1975 in the US and B. burgdorferi first identified in 1982, B. miyamotoi was only identified in ticks in 1995 in Japan. But once discovered, it was soon found in many other places, including Europe and many parts of North America. Ticks collected in California as early as 2000 were found to carry the new spirochete, for example. Yet, the first cases of disease caused by B. miyamotoi in the US were only first confirmed in 2013 in the Northeast. Until now, no confirmed cases have been reported in the western part of the country, despite the bacterium's prevalence in adult black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) being similar to that of B. burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete.\n\nShadowy disease\n\nB. miyamotoi disease, or hard tick relapsing fever, is a tricky infection to identify. It is often marked by fevers that come and go, along with nondescript fatigue, chills, and aches and pains. In severe cases, which often affect people with compromised immune systems, the disease can progress to meningoencephalitis, inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissue. But in many cases, the disease resolves on its own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn clinical tests, people infected tend to show low levels of white blood cells and platelets (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), as well as elevated liver enzymes and excess protein in their urine. But there are no simple tests to confirm the disease. Borrelia bacteria share many proteins, so probing for antibodies against the microbe will easily pick up other related bacteria, including the one that causes Lyme disease. The only method to definitively identify a B. miyamotoi infection is to directly probe for fragments of the bacterium's genetic sequence in a person's blood or cerebrospinal fluid, which few laboratories do.\n\nIf an infection is confirmed, there's no well-established treatment. With so few cases clearly identified, researchers have not been able to run clinical trials. But, so far, a two-week course of doxycycline or amoxicillin antibiotics seems to do the trick for most cases, with IV-antibiotic treatments being used in severe cases. A small number of people, however, may experience what's called \"the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction,\" which occurs in the first few hours or days of an antibiotic treatment for spirochete infection. That includes not only B. miyamotoi disease and Lyme disease, but also syphilis, leptospirosis, and others. The reaction is marked by fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, headache, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, hyperventilation, flushing, and pain. It's unclear exactly what causes this, but researchers hypothesize that as the spirochetes begin to die, they release toxins that spur an acute inflammatory response. The reaction often resolves on its own within a day or so, but it can turn life-threatening for some, and patients need to be monitored closely."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "FTX has recovered $7.3 billion, tells court \u201cthe dumpster fire is out\u201d", "text": "FTX's new leadership has recovered $7.3 billion in assets and is considering whether to restart the cryptocurrency exchange, a company lawyer reportedly said during a hearing at US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware yesterday.

But in court yesterday, Dietderich \"offered few details on what a reboot [of the crypto exchange] might mean for FTX customers whose crypto deposits have been locked up during the bankruptcy case,\" Reuters wrote.\n\nThere are several questions to be answered before FTX can restart. Reuters wrote:\n\nFTX would need significant capital to restart its crypto exchange, because the existing customer interface had little connection to the movement of money behind the scenes, the lawyer said. \"The app worked beautifully, but in truth it was a facade,\" Dietderich said. It is not clear whether FTX should use its own funds to restart the exchange, rather than using the money to repay customers, Dietderich said. Restarting the exchange might require outside funding or a sale of the exchange's assets.\n\nIn January, FTX's new CEO, John Ray, discussed possibly restarting the exchange. \"Everything is on the table,\" he told The Wall Street Journal. \"If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we'll do it.\"\n\nFTX would examine whether it can return more money to creditors by reviving the exchange than by liquidating or selling all the assets. \"There are stakeholders we're working with who've identified what they see is a viable business,\" Ray said during the January interview."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Microsoft is experimenting with a Steam Deck-friendly \u201chandheld mode\u201d for Windows", "text": "The Steam Deck's default Linux operating system and the Proton translation layer can run a surprising number of PC games well, but to maximize compatibility and flexibility (and to use it like a PC when you're not gaming), installing Windows is always an option. There are also alternate handheld PC designs like the AYA Neo that ship with Windows by default.\n\nBut Windows isn't an ideal operating system for the Steam Deck, at least not out of the box. Its mouse-and-keyboard-oriented user interface isn't comfortable or convenient to use on a small handheld system like the Steam Deck. Windows 11 makes some allowances for touchscreens, but its buttons and menus can still be hard to tap on such a small screen.

The presentation also calls for other changes to Windows' default behaviors, like always opening apps in full-screen mode when in Handheld Mode, better UI scaling for small screens, and \"mapping of controls to common Windows functions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile interesting, we have no idea whether Handheld Mode will get buy-in from the rest of the Windows team, and it's not present anywhere in any of the many Windows Insider Preview channels that Microsoft uses to test new features publicly.

The new tires used rubber from a desert shrub called guayule (Parthenium argentatum). Now, Bridgestone is ready to try the rubber in a more practical application and has produced a demonstration run of road-going tires using guayule rubber and a high percentage of recycled materials. The company will conduct tests with automakers to prove the concept.\n\nThe world produces about 2 billion tires each year, and while synthetic rubbers are used in modest amounts, most road tires use a lot of natural rubber from the para rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). But 90 percent of para rubber is grown in Southeast Asia and has to be shipped around the world to reach tire factories.\n\nBridgestone has been looking at guayule as an alternative for a little over a decade now. The guayule plant is a short, woody shrub that grows easily in the deserts of the American Southwest and requires much less water than crops like alfalfa or cotton that are also grown there. In Arizona, Bridgestone has been breeding guayule and conducting research and development on its use in tire-making.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore than just natural rubber\n\nIn fact, these new tires incorporate more than just guayule rubber.

His sentencing means all three of the people spearheading this Dutch QAnon offshoot have now been jailed.\n\nKat\u2019s sentencing echoes the case of the US talk show host Alex Jones, who was found liable for defaming the parents of children killed in a massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, after falsely claiming that the mass shooting was a hoax. The hope is that legal proceedings introduce a chilling effect \u201cin a positive sense,\u201d says Ciar\u00e1n O'Connor, senior analyst with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank that researches online hate. \u201cOther conspiracy theorists, who engage in dangerous belief systems that might endanger members of the public, might see this action and think twice about spreading lurid conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nThe Bodegraven conspiracy centered around claims made by Joost Knevel, who claimed to remember witnessing a satanic pedophile ring operating in the town when he was a child. \u201cHe initially implicated a local doctor, and it was a local story,\u201d says Sander van der Linden, a professor of psychology at Cambridge University in the UK, who advises governments and companies on how to prevent the spread of misinformation online. But when Knevel teamed up with Kat, a former journalist with a track record of being sued for defamation and making bomb threats, and another conspiracy theorist named Wouter Raatgever, the story morphed to claim that perpetrators also included the country\u2019s prime minister, Mark Rutte, and the head of the Netherlands\u2019 public health institute, Jaap van Dissel, who was at the time the public face of the country\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cThese two other conspiracy theorists helped him craft the narrative in a way that made it really go viral,\u201d says van der Linden.\n\nThe inclusion of more high-profile figures in the story meant the Bodegraven conspiracy more closely echoed the QAnon template, van der Linden adds. Not only did it play into anti-lockdown sentiments circulating at the time, but the idea of mass child abuse was also shocking enough to attract the attention of even ordinary people\u2014prompting the conspiracy to go viral, he adds."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "From the original series to Picard, we\u2019ve ranked every starship Enterprise", "text": "Minor spoilers for this week's Star Trek: Picard are below.\n\nIt's the day Star Trek: Picard fans have been waiting for all season: this week we finally get to Frontier Day! A fleet-wide celebration of the Federation and Starfleet, where everything goes according to plan and nothing surprising happens!\n\nAs part of the festivities, the episode gives us a good look at USS Enterprise-F, a ship which has existed for a decade-plus in Star Trek Online but is only making its first canonical appearance in Picard. It is, depending on how you count, the newest and most advanced version of the Enterprise we've seen in action in any Trek movie or TV show (yes, we talk about the Enterprise-J later).\n\nA new Enterprise means a new opportunity to re-evaluate the many canonical Enterprises that have existed in the last half-century; to that end, we've assembled a completely scientific and objectively correct ranked listing of every starship Enterprise, from the original '60s show to Picard. For good measure, we've also ranked various versions of different Enterprises from reboots, updates, and alternate timelines, plus a few Enterprises that didn't log much screen time but did deserve a quick mention.\n\n#11: Alternate future anti-time Enterprise-D\n\nThe Next Generation has a nearly perfect finale episode, one that nicely wraps up the week-to-week televised adventures of the crew while leaving the door open to what looked like (and, on rare occasions, actually was) a promising movie franchise.\n\nIt also gave us a look at an \"anti-time\" far-future version of the Enterprise-D, where it was still in service after extensive refits rather than being crashed into the surface of a planet. And it... just has a bunch of extra stuff stuck to it? Including a third weird centrally mounted nacelle? It certainly makes it easy to tell the difference between the regular Enterprise and the future Enterprise when they're both in the same shot, but it's just way too busy and slapped-together looking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFun fact: The events of Star Trek: Picard are taking place even later than the events of this anti-time future. If anyone sees a Galaxy-class ship with three nacelles flying around, let me know.\n\n#10: Kelvin-timeline Enterprise\n\nThe first of a few different riffs on the original Enterprise that will appear on this list, the J.J. Abrams \"Kelvin-timeline\" version of the Enterprise leaves me cold. I think it's mostly the gigantic, bulbous nacelles, which are each nearly as big as the secondary hull (the part below the saucer with the circular deflector dish attached to the front, for people who don't spend a ton of time on Memory Alpha studying starship designs). They make the whole ship look top-heavy and bug-eyed.\n\nEvery light on the ship is also a glowing whiteish-blue, giving it a monochromatic appearance that just isn't as fun to look at. It's a slick, sterile, Apple Store Enterprise. I don't hate it, but I can't defend it, either.\n\n#9: NX-01 Enterprise\n\nThe retconned \u201cfirst starship Enterprise\u201d is a flat little thing. It does look like an old, simple predecessor of the starships that would come later, and the red tips on the nacelles do a little spinny thing that calls forward to the nacelles on the '60s Enterprise model.\n\nI understand that they couldn't make this forerunner to Kirk's Enterprise look more fancy and advanced than the ship that replaced it, but understanding why the NX-class Enterprise looks the way it does isn\u2019t enough to make me fall in love with it."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Iconic image of M87 black hole just got a machine-learning makeover", "text": "The iconic image of a supermassive black hole in the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy\u2014described by astronomers as a \"fuzzy orange donut\"\u2014was a stunning testament to the capabilities of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). But there were still gaps in the observational data, limiting the resolution the EHT was able to achieve. Now four members of the EHT collaboration have applied a new machine-learning technique dubbed PRIMO (principal-component interferometric modeling) to the original 2017 data, giving that famous image its first makeover. They described their achievement in a new paper published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n\u201cPRIMO is a new approach to the difficult task of constructing images from EHT observations,\u201d said co-author Tod Lauer (NOIRLab). \u201cIt provides a way to compensate for the missing information about the object being observed, which is required to generate the image that would have been seen using a single gigantic radio telescope the size of the Earth.\u201d\n\nAs we've reported previously, the EHT isn't a telescope in the traditional sense. Instead, it's a collection of telescopes scattered around the globe, including hardware from Hawaii to Europe, and from the South Pole to Greenland, though not all of these were active during the initial observations. The telescope is created by a process called interferometry, which uses light captured at different locations to build an image with a resolution that is the equivalent of a giant telescope (a telescope so big, it\u2019s as if it were as large as the distance between the most distant locations of the individual telescopes).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBack in 2019, the EHT made headlines with its announcement of the first direct image of a black hole, located in the constellation of Virgo, some 55 million light years away. It was a feat that would have been impossible a mere generation ago, made possible by technological breakthroughs, innovative new algorithms, and of course, connecting several of the world's best radio observatories. Science magazine named the image its Breakthrough of the Year.\n\nThe EHT captured photons trapped in orbit around the black hole, swirling around at near the speed of light, creating a bright ring around it. From this, astronomers deduced that the black hole is spinning clockwise. The imaging also revealed the shadow of the black hole, a dark central region within the ring. That shadow is as close as astronomers can get to taking a picture of the actual black hole, from which light cannot escape once it crosses the event horizon. And just as the size of the event horizon is proportional to the black hole's mass, so, too, is the black hole's shadow: the more massive the black hole, the larger the shadow. It was a stunning confirmation of the general theory of relativity, showing that those predictions hold up even in extreme gravitational environments.\n\nTwo years later, the EHT released a new image of the same black hole, this time showing how it looked in polarized light. The ability to measure that polarization for the first time\u2014a signature of magnetic fields at the black hole's edge\u2014yielded fresh insight into how black holes gobble up matter and emit powerful jets from their cores. That polarization enabled astronomers to map the magnetic field lines at the inner edge and to study the interaction between matter flowing in and being blown outward."}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0646\u06d2 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0679\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0646\u0627\u0642\u0635 \u06c1\u06d2: \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u06c1", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0688 \u0631\u06cc\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633 \u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a 22 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0686 \u062a\u06a9 \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0648\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631 \u06c1\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0679 \u0646\u06d2 \u0646\u0646\u06be\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0646\u0628 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u062d\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062c \u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u06af\u0632\u0631\u062a\u06d2 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0632\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u0686\u06cc\u0641 \u062c\u0633\u0679\u0633 \u06a9\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0679\u0633", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06c1 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u06cc\u0648\u0631\u067e\u06cc \u06cc\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2\u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u06af\u0632\u0679 \u067e\u0631\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0637\u06d2\u067e\u0627\u06af\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0627\u06c1\u062f \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u067e\u0631 3\u0645\u0627\u06c1 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u0626\u06d2  \u067e\u0631\u0648\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u067e\u0627\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u062e\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0646 \u067e\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u0631\u06c1\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u06be\u06cc\u06ba", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a: \u063a\u0641\u0644\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06c1\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0633\u067e\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0632\u062e\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0679\u06cc \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0679\u0627\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0648 \u06c1\u06cc \u062a\u06a9\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u06af\u0648\u06af\u0644 \u0627\u067e\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0646 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0648 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u062d \u062f\u06cc\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2\u061f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0641\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0679\u0644\u060c \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06c1 \u0635\u0631\u0641 35 \u0688\u0627\u0644\u0631", "text": ""}, {"source": "axios", "title": "Senior U.S. officials visit Saudi Arabia in sign of improving relations", "text": "President Biden\u2019s senior Middle East adviser Brett McGurk and U.S. envoy for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security Amos Hochstein traveled to Saudi Arabia this week for talks with senior Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the White House told Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: McGurk and Hochstein are the most senior U.S. officials to visit Saudi Arabia since a crisis erupted between the two countries after the Saudi-led decision to cut oil production last October.

They include New York-based Peruvian American Erik Ramirez for the \"outstanding chef\" prize and a Kansas City, Missouri, tortiller\u00eda for \"outstanding bakery.\"\n\nAmong the best regional chef nominees are Venezuelan American Gregory Le\u00f3n, who runs Amilinda in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Natalia Vallejo for San Juan's Cocina Al Fondo (the first female Puerto Rican nominee in the awards' history); and Mexican-born Dionicio Jim\u00e9nez for his Philadelphia cantina, La Martina.\n\nCora Cora, a Peruvian restaurant run by sisters Grecia and Macarena Ludena, is competing for \"outstanding restaurant.\" It's the first Connecticut-based finalist in over a decade.\n\nThe only finalist from Colorado is Michael Diaz de Leon, executive director of Denver's BRUT\u00d8.\n\nTatem\u00f3, a Houston joint that centers Mexican corn varieties in different presentations, and Causa, with a Peruvian tasting menu in Washington D.C., are in the running for best new restaurant.\n\nWhat they're saying: \"I think as years have gone by the foundation has realized that amazing food really can come from all over and not just restaurants with, like, a white-tie look and French-trained cooks,\" Le\u00f3n, who opened Amilinda (an amalgamation of his parents' names) in 2015, tells Axios Latino.\n\nThe Ludena sisters from Cora Cora say the nominations, regardless of who wins, will open the door for more people to see the richness of the Latino community.\n\n\"When we got here many people didn't even know where Peru is or what quinoa was\u2026 now we feel seen because this major prize has noticed that Latin American cuisines have so much to offer here in the U.S. as well,\" says Grecia Ludena.\n\nThe big picture: Before the last couple of years, most James Beard award winners were white non-Hispanic men, and less than a quarter of all nominees had been people of color, according to a review from media company MIC.\n\nThe foundation suspended its 2020 and 2021 awards to audit potential systemic bias and overhaul its nomination process, eventually setting a goal to have at least half of its members and judges be people of color by later this year.\n\nExperts who help make nominations now get DEI training, and judges consider recommendations from the public.\n\nWhat to watch: Winners will be announced on June 5.\n\nSubscribe to Axios Latino to get vital news about Latinos and Latin America, delivered to your inbox on Tuesdays and Thursdays."}, {"source": "axios", "title": "China sanctions senior U.S. lawmaker McCaul for visiting Taiwan", "text": "China on Thursday sanctioned Rep.
