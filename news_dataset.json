For years, he delivered mail and all manner of packages: a car bumper, a mini refrigerator, a 70-pound box of horseshoes for a blacksmith. But when an Amazon.com contract with the United States Postal Service required carriers to start delivering packages on Sundays, Groff balked. A Christian, he told his employers that he couldn't deliver packages on the Lord's Day.\n\nNow Groff's dispute with the Postal Service has reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which will consider his case Tuesday. Lower courts have sided with the Postal Service, which says Groff's demand for Sundays off meant extra work for other employees and caused tension. Groff, for his part, argues employers can too easily reject employees' requests for religious accommodations, and if he wins, that could change.\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t go back and change what happened to me,\u201d said Groff, who ultimately quit his job over the Sunday shifts. But he says that other people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between their job and their faith.\u201d\n\nGroff\u2019s case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious discrimination in employment. The law requires employers to accommodate employees\u2019 religious practices unless doing so would be an \u201cundue hardship\u201d for the business.\n\nGroff grew up in Lancaster County, where he attended Mennonite schools and lived in a home across the street from his grandparents' farm. His grandfather's death around the time he graduated from high school was a turning point for him, he said, and helped motivate him to work as a missionary. While he has a college degree in biology, over the years he has gone on eight mission trips lasting anywhere from two months to two years that took him to Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe did different jobs in between but in 2012 he found a job at the Postal Service, regularly filling in as a mail carrier when other carriers were off or sick.\n\n\u201cI just really enjoyed the job from the very beginning. You get to be out in the countryside, in the fresh air ... It\u2019s a beautiful place to live and work and I just really enjoyed it and planned to make a career of it unless God called me back to the mission field somewhere,\u201d said Groff of his job as a rural carrier associate.\n\nAs a fill-in mail carrier he ultimately learned 22 different routes, which he would drive in his Honda CR-V, hitting 500 to 800 mailboxes a day. Eventually, he hoped to become a regular mail carrier, with a set route of his own.\n\nSoon after Groff joined the Postal Service, however, it signed a contract with Amazon to deliver packages on Sundays. And about four years into the job Groff was told he'd have to start working his share of Sunday shifts. Groff said no. Sunday, he says, is \u201ca day we come together as Christian believers and we honor the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so to give that up, to deliver Amazon packages would be to give up everything that we believe in,\u201d Groff said.\n\nTo avoid Sunday work, Groff gave up his seniority at the post office in rural Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where the parking lot includes two spaces labeled \u201cHORSE AND CARRIAGE ONLY.\u201d He transferred to a smaller office in nearby Holtwood, which was not yet doing Sunday deliveries. Eventually, however, Sunday deliveries were required there too.\n\nGroff told his supervisor he'd work extra shifts and holidays to avoid Sundays. The supervisor tried to find other carriers for Groff's Sunday shifts, even though finding substitutes was time consuming and not always possible. Groff's absences, meanwhile, created a tense environment, led to resentment toward management and contributed to morale problems, officials said. It also meant other carriers had to work more Sundays or sometimes deliver more Sunday mail than they otherwise would. One carrier transferred and another resigned in part because of the situation, Groff's supervisor said.\n\nEventually, however, Groff missed enough Sundays that he was disciplined. He resigned in 2019 rather than wait to be fired, he said, and then filed a religious discrimination lawsuit.\n\nGroff says that under a 1977 Supreme Court case, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, employers don't have to show much to prove an undue hardship and can deny religious accommodations to employees when they impose \u201cmore than a de minimis cost\u201d on the business. The case was 7-2 in favor of TWA with both liberals and conservatives in the majority.\n\nBut Groff's lawyer Hiram Sasser of the First Liberty Institute says the Hardison case \u201csort of stacked the deck against employees and the common folk.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to try to win one of their cases, and, I mean, that's not right,\u201d he said.\n\nGroff wants the Supreme Court to say that employers must show \u201csignificant difficulty or expense\u201d if they want to reject a religious accommodation.\n\nBiden administration lawyers representing the Postal Service say Hardison should be clarified to make clear it gives substantial protection for religious observance. But the administration also says that when accommodating the religious practices of one employee negatively impacts other employees, that can be an undue hardship on a business.\n\nGroff would seem to have the upper hand. Three current justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 have said the court should reconsider Hardison. And in recent years the court's conservative majority has been particularly sympathetic to the concerns of religious plaintiffs.\n\nLast year, for example, the court sided with another one of First Liberty's clients, a football coach at a public high school who wanted to be able to kneel and pray on the field after games.\n\nGroff, for his part, has found other work since leaving the Postal Service. These days, he's essentially the postmaster for a retirement community with several thousand residents. He oversees a staff of volunteer residents that sorts mail and puts it in mailboxes every day except Sunday.\n\nThere are no Sunday deliveries to Groff's home either. He says he went in and disabled them on Amazon.\n\n\u201cI can wait for that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I need it that bad, I\u2019ll go to the store and get it.\u201d", "tags": ["tuesday", "mennonite", "sunday"]}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "Ex-Cardinal McCarrick charged in Wisconsin with sex abuse", "text": "The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church\u2019s clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church's clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago, court records show.\n\nA criminal complaint filed Friday alleges that Theodore McCarrick, who was removed from the priesthood in 2019 after a Vatican investigation found he had sexually molested adults and children, fondled a man in 1977 while staying at a cabin on Geneva Lake in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nThe alleged victim, who is not named, told investigators that McCarrick had repeatedly sexually assaulted him since he was 11 and even brought him to parties where other adult men sexually assaulted him, according to the complaint.\n\nMcCarrick became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic official in the U.S. to face criminal charges for sexual abuse when he was accused in 2021 of sexually assaulting a teenage boy in Massachusetts at a wedding reception in 1974. His attorneys asked the judge in that case earlier this year to dismiss the charges, saying that McCarrick, now 92 and suffering from dementia, is not competent to stand trial.\n\nThe once-powerful priest was ordained in 1958 and became archbishop in Newark, New Jersey, in 1986 and then archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000. He rose to power despite church officials' knowledge of accusations against him. A two-year Vatican investigation into McCarrick's tenure found credible reports of his problematic behavior dating back to 1999, including an inquiry confirming that McCarrick had slept with seminarians.\n\nThe church has confirmed it made financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct. McCarrick retired in 2006 but continued to be active in political circles until he was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019.\n\nWisconsin prosecutors learned of the alleged 1977 assault through a program dedicated to prosecuting instances of abuse by faith leaders, according to a news release. Officials were able to charge McCarrick because the statute of limitations does not apply to people who are not residents of the state. A similar law allowed Massachusetts prosecutors to bring their case against McCarrick more than 40 years later.\n\nMcCarrick's attorney in Massachusetts, William Fick, did not immediately return a phone call or email sent Monday. An attorney for McCarrick has not yet been listed in the Wisconsin case.\n\n___\n\nHarm Venhuizen is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

He also argued that legal and procedural errors deprived Chauvin of a fair trial. But the three-judge panel sided with prosecutors who said Chauvin got a fair trial and just sentence.\n\nFloyd died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, used his knee to pin the Black man\u2019s neck to the ground for 9 1/2 minutes. A bystander video captured Floyd\u2019s fading cries of \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Floyd\u2019s death touched off protests around the world, some of which turned violent, and forced a national reckoning with police brutality and racism.\n\n\u201cPolice officers undoubtedly have a challenging, difficult, and sometimes dangerous job. However, no one is above the law,\" Appeals Judge Peter Reyes wrote for the panel. \"When they commit a crime, they must be held accountable just as those individuals that they lawfully apprehend. The law only permits police officers to use reasonable force when effecting a lawful arrest. Chauvin crossed that line here when he used unreasonable force on Floyd.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who assembled the prosecution team, said in a statement that he was \u201cgrateful we have a system where everyone, no matter how egregious their offense, is entitled to due process and fair treatment.\"\n\n\u201cThe Court\u2019s decision today shows once again no one is above the law \u2014 and no one is beneath it,\u201d Ellison said.\n\nA voicemail and emails were sent to Chauvin\u2019s attorney, William Mohrman. He argued on appeal that the trial judge should have moved the case out of Minneapolis because of extensive pretrial publicity and unprecedented security precautions due to fears of violence.\n\n\u201cThe primary issue on this appeal is whether a criminal defendant can get a fair trial consistent with constitutional requirements in a courthouse surrounded by concrete block, barbed wire, two armored personnel carriers, and a squad of National Guard troops, all of which or whom are there for one purpose: in the event that the jury acquits the defendant,\u201d Mohrman said in oral arguments in January.\n\nBut Neal Katyal, a special attorney for the state, argued that Chauvin got \u201cone of the most transparent and thorough trials in our nation\u2019s history.\"\n\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill sentenced Chauvin to 22 1/2 years after jurors found him guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin later pleaded guilty to a separate federal civil rights charge and was sentenced to 21 years in federal prison, which he is now serving in Arizona concurrent with his state sentence.\n\n\u201cJudge Cahill managed this trial with enormous care, and even if Chauvin could identify some minor fault, any error is harmless,\u201d Katyal said. \u201cThe evidence of Chauvin\u2019s guilt was captured on video for the world to see.\u201d\n\nMohrman argued that the pretrial publicity was the most extensive of any trial in Minnesota history, and that the judge should have moved the trial and sequestered the jury. He said the publicity and the riots, the city\u2019s $27 million settlement with Floyd\u2019s family announced during jury selection, the unrest over a police killing of a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb during jury selection, and the sealing off of the courthouse, were just some of the factors prejudicing Chauvin\u2019s chance of a fair trial.\n\nHis appeal also focused on one juror who participated in a civil rights event commemorating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s March on Washington, a few months after Floyd\u2019s death. Only after the trial did the juror reveal that he had been there.\n\nBut the appeals court ruled that Cahill did not abuse his discretion in deciding those issues.\n\nLocal defense attorney Mike Brandt, who has followed the case closely, said he was not surprised that the appeals court affirmed Chauvin\u2019s conviction and found no errors that would have changed the outcome. Appellate courts give judges wide discretion and are loath to micromanage how they run trials, he said. He added that Cahill created a solid record to justify the decisions he made in a \u201chigh-pressure case where literally the eyes of the world were on him.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court declined to address whether it was legally permissible to convict Chauvin of third-degree murder. The defense said a 2021 Minnesota Supreme Court decision in a different police killing case that clarified the definition of that crime meant the law no longer fit the facts of Floyd's killing. But the appeals court noted that the trial judge never formally adjudicated that conviction nor did he sentence Chauvin on that count.", "tags": ["murder", "killing", "death"]}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "SpaceX set for Monday test flight of giant Starship rocket", "text": "SpaceX scrubbed the launch of its powerful Starship rocket -- which is expected to eventually carry passengers to the moon and Mars -- that was set for Monday morning.\n\nThe uncrewed launch of the world's largest rocket would have marked the first flight test of a \"fully integrated\" Starship spacecraft and the so-called Super Heavy rocket, SpaceX said.
