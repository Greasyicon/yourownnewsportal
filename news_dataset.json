McFarland lived on a small piece of land on a Native American reservation in Palm Springs he described as a \u201clittle world of its own,\u201d surrounded by the parts of the city that were tourist magnets and depicted in movies.\n\nThe retiree, who now lives in Mississippi, recently recalled seeing houses of the diverse, tight-knit community being torn and burned down in the square-mile area known as Section 14.\n\n\u201cWe thought they were just cleaning up some of the old houses,\u201d he said.\n\nBut eventually his family was told to vacate their home, and McFarland, his mother and his younger brother hopped around from house to house before leaving the area altogether and moving to Cabazon, a small town about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Palm Springs.\n\nDecades later, Palm Springs\u2019 city council is reckoning with those actions, voting in 2021 to issue a formal apology to former residents for the city\u2019s role in displacing them in the 1960s from the neighborhood that many Black and Mexican American families called home. But the former residents say that is not enough.\n\nThose former residents now say the city owes them more than $2.3 billion for the harm caused by their displacement. That would be nearly $1.2 million per family. The dollar amount was disclosed Sunday at a meeting attended by experts such as Cheryl Grills, a member of the state\u2019s reparations task force studying redress proposals for African Americans.\n\nThe effort in Palm Springs is part of a growing push by Black families to seek compensation and other forms of restitution from local and state governments for harms they\u2019ve suffered due to generations of discriminatory policies that continued long after slavery ended.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s statewide reparations task force is evaluating how the state can atone for policies like eminent domain that allowed governments to seize property from Black homeowners and redlining that restricted what neighborhoods Black families could live in. Last year, Los Angeles County officials voted to complete the return of land in Manhattan Beach to a Black family descended from property owners who had it seized by the city through eminent domain in the 1920s. The family decided to sell the property back to the county for $20 million.\n\nPalm Springs officials expect to work with a \u201creparations consultant\u201d to decide whether and how to compensate the families displaced from the area, said Amy Blaisdell, a spokesperson for the city, in an email. The council may take this up for a vote later this month. The city, located about 110 miles (177 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, is home to about 45,000 people today and is largely known as a desert resort community, home to golf courses and ritzy resorts.\n\nThe families are also exploring legal avenues for reparations. Areva Martin, a Los Angeles lawyer representing them, filed a tort claim with the city in November alleging officials hired contractors to bulldoze homes and sent the fire department to burn them. City officials said in response that they would work with former residents and their descendants to try to come up with a solution, Martin said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of the tremendous contributions they made to the city,\u201d she said.\n\nJulianne Malveaux, an economist and dean of the College of Ethnic Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, said the $2.3 billion figure accounts for the displacement of 2,000 families and the trauma caused to them.\n\nLisa Middleton, a city council member and former Palm Springs mayor, said it was important to acknowledge the city\u2019s role in displacing Section 14 residents.\n\n\u201cOur history includes some wonderful moments for which we have every right to be proud,\u201d she said at a meeting. \u201cBut it also includes some moments for which we have every reason to be remorseful, to learn from those mistakes and to make sure that we do not pass those mistakes onto another generation.\u201d\n\nBut the story of displacement at Section 14 is more complicated than some people may realize, said Renee Brown, associate curator and archivist for the Palm Springs Historical Society.\n\nSection 14 is a part of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation. The tribe wanted to open up Section 14 to lease to developers, and the city helped it clear the land over the course of more than a decade, Brown said.\n\n\u201cThe city could never have gone on that land and done anything,\u201d she said, without \u201ctribal permission.\u201d\n\nThe tribe did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe tort claim argues the tragedy was akin to the violence that decimated a vibrant community known as Black Wall Street more than a century ago in Tulsa, Oklahoma, leaving as many as 300 people dead. There were no reported deaths in connection with the displacement of families from Section 14.\n\nThree survivors of the Tulsa massacre are seeking compensation through a lawsuit filed against the city. U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation in 2021 to try to make it easier for survivors and descendants to seek reparations, but the bill never received a hearing.\n\nPalmdale resident Pearl Devers lived in Section 14 with her family until she was 12 years old. She helped spearhead efforts in recent years to create a group to reflect on their time living there and determine next steps.\n\nHer father, a carpenter, helped build their home and many others in Section 14, she said. She recalled how close residents in the neighborhood were, saying her neighbors acted as a \u201csecond set of parents\u201d for her and her brother.\n\nShe recalled smelling and seeing burning homes until one day her mother said their family had to pack their bags and leave.\n\n\u201cWe just felt like we were running from being burned out,\u201d she said.\n\nAlvin Taylor, Devers\u2019 brother, said it\u2019s essential for city officials to listen to displaced residents and descendants before deciding on a course of action for how to best make amends.\n\n\u201cAn apology is not enough,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n___\n\nSophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

For years, he delivered mail and all manner of packages: a car bumper, a mini refrigerator, a 70-pound box of horseshoes for a blacksmith. But when an Amazon.com contract with the United States Postal Service required carriers to start delivering packages on Sundays, Groff balked. A Christian, he told his employers that he couldn't deliver packages on the Lord's Day.\n\nNow Groff's dispute with the Postal Service has reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which will consider his case Tuesday. Lower courts have sided with the Postal Service, which says Groff's demand for Sundays off meant extra work for other employees and caused tension. Groff, for his part, argues employers can too easily reject employees' requests for religious accommodations, and if he wins, that could change.\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t go back and change what happened to me,\u201d said Groff, who ultimately quit his job over the Sunday shifts. But he says that other people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between their job and their faith.\u201d\n\nGroff\u2019s case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious discrimination in employment. The law requires employers to accommodate employees\u2019 religious practices unless doing so would be an \u201cundue hardship\u201d for the business.\n\nGroff grew up in Lancaster County, where he attended Mennonite schools and lived in a home across the street from his grandparents' farm. His grandfather's death around the time he graduated from high school was a turning point for him, he said, and helped motivate him to work as a missionary. While he has a college degree in biology, over the years he has gone on eight mission trips lasting anywhere from two months to two years that took him to Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe did different jobs in between but in 2012 he found a job at the Postal Service, regularly filling in as a mail carrier when other carriers were off or sick.\n\n\u201cI just really enjoyed the job from the very beginning. You get to be out in the countryside, in the fresh air ... It\u2019s a beautiful place to live and work and I just really enjoyed it and planned to make a career of it unless God called me back to the mission field somewhere,\u201d said Groff of his job as a rural carrier associate.\n\nAs a fill-in mail carrier he ultimately learned 22 different routes, which he would drive in his Honda CR-V, hitting 500 to 800 mailboxes a day. Eventually, he hoped to become a regular mail carrier, with a set route of his own.\n\nSoon after Groff joined the Postal Service, however, it signed a contract with Amazon to deliver packages on Sundays. And about four years into the job Groff was told he'd have to start working his share of Sunday shifts. Groff said no. Sunday, he says, is \u201ca day we come together as Christian believers and we honor the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so to give that up, to deliver Amazon packages would be to give up everything that we believe in,\u201d Groff said.\n\nTo avoid Sunday work, Groff gave up his seniority at the post office in rural Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where the parking lot includes two spaces labeled \u201cHORSE AND CARRIAGE ONLY.\u201d He transferred to a smaller office in nearby Holtwood, which was not yet doing Sunday deliveries. Eventually, however, Sunday deliveries were required there too.\n\nGroff told his supervisor he'd work extra shifts and holidays to avoid Sundays. The supervisor tried to find other carriers for Groff's Sunday shifts, even though finding substitutes was time consuming and not always possible. Groff's absences, meanwhile, created a tense environment, led to resentment toward management and contributed to morale problems, officials said. It also meant other carriers had to work more Sundays or sometimes deliver more Sunday mail than they otherwise would. One carrier transferred and another resigned in part because of the situation, Groff's supervisor said.\n\nEventually, however, Groff missed enough Sundays that he was disciplined. He resigned in 2019 rather than wait to be fired, he said, and then filed a religious discrimination lawsuit.\n\nGroff says that under a 1977 Supreme Court case, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, employers don't have to show much to prove an undue hardship and can deny religious accommodations to employees when they impose \u201cmore than a de minimis cost\u201d on the business. The case was 7-2 in favor of TWA with both liberals and conservatives in the majority.\n\nBut Groff's lawyer Hiram Sasser of the First Liberty Institute says the Hardison case \u201csort of stacked the deck against employees and the common folk.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to try to win one of their cases, and, I mean, that's not right,\u201d he said.\n\nGroff wants the Supreme Court to say that employers must show \u201csignificant difficulty or expense\u201d if they want to reject a religious accommodation.\n\nBiden administration lawyers representing the Postal Service say Hardison should be clarified to make clear it gives substantial protection for religious observance. But the administration also says that when accommodating the religious practices of one employee negatively impacts other employees, that can be an undue hardship on a business.\n\nGroff would seem to have the upper hand. Three current justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 have said the court should reconsider Hardison. And in recent years the court's conservative majority has been particularly sympathetic to the concerns of religious plaintiffs.\n\nLast year, for example, the court sided with another one of First Liberty's clients, a football coach at a public high school who wanted to be able to kneel and pray on the field after games.\n\nGroff, for his part, has found other work since leaving the Postal Service. These days, he's essentially the postmaster for a retirement community with several thousand residents. He oversees a staff of volunteer residents that sorts mail and puts it in mailboxes every day except Sunday.\n\nThere are no Sunday deliveries to Groff's home either. He says he went in and disabled them on Amazon.\n\n\u201cI can wait for that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I need it that bad, I\u2019ll go to the store and get it.\u201d", "tags": ["tuesday", "mennonite", "sunday"]}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "Ex-Cardinal McCarrick charged in Wisconsin with sex abuse", "text": "The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church\u2019s clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church's clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago, court records show.\n\nA criminal complaint filed Friday alleges that Theodore McCarrick, who was removed from the priesthood in 2019 after a Vatican investigation found he had sexually molested adults and children, fondled a man in 1977 while staying at a cabin on Geneva Lake in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nThe alleged victim, who is not named, told investigators that McCarrick had repeatedly sexually assaulted him since he was 11 and even brought him to parties where other adult men sexually assaulted him, according to the complaint.\n\nMcCarrick became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic official in the U.S. to face criminal charges for sexual abuse when he was accused in 2021 of sexually assaulting a teenage boy in Massachusetts at a wedding reception in 1974. His attorneys asked the judge in that case earlier this year to dismiss the charges, saying that McCarrick, now 92 and suffering from dementia, is not competent to stand trial.\n\nThe once-powerful priest was ordained in 1958 and became archbishop in Newark, New Jersey, in 1986 and then archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000. He rose to power despite church officials' knowledge of accusations against him. A two-year Vatican investigation into McCarrick's tenure found credible reports of his problematic behavior dating back to 1999, including an inquiry confirming that McCarrick had slept with seminarians.\n\nThe church has confirmed it made financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct. McCarrick retired in 2006 but continued to be active in political circles until he was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019.\n\nWisconsin prosecutors learned of the alleged 1977 assault through a program dedicated to prosecuting instances of abuse by faith leaders, according to a news release. Officials were able to charge McCarrick because the statute of limitations does not apply to people who are not residents of the state. A similar law allowed Massachusetts prosecutors to bring their case against McCarrick more than 40 years later.\n\nMcCarrick's attorney in Massachusetts, William Fick, did not immediately return a phone call or email sent Monday.

The 38-year-old has won four of the six major marathons; Boston is the only one he has competed in and failed to win. (He has never run New York.) He also broke 2 hours in an exhibition in a Vienna park.\n\nFighting a headwind and rain that dampened the roads, Kipchoge ran in the lead pack from the start in Hopkinton until the series of climbs collectively known as Heartbreak Hill. But to the surprise of the fans lined up along Boylston Street for the final kick, he wasn\u2019t among the three leaders.\n\n\u201cI live for the moments where I get to challenge the limits,\u201d Kipchoge said in a statement distributed by the race organizers. \u201cIt's never guaranteed, it's never easy. Today was a tough day for me. I pushed myself as hard as I could, but sometimes, we must accept that today wasn't the day to push the barrier to a greater height.\u201d\n\nHe also congratulated the winners and thanked the fans for their support.\n\n\u201cIn sports you win and you lose and there is always tomorrow to set a new challenge,\u201d said Kipchoge, who has stated a goal to win all six major marathons but did not announce any plans on Monday. \u201cExcited for what's ahead.\u201d\n\nMarcel Hug of Switzerland won the men\u2019s wheelchair race in a course record time \u2013 his sixth victory here. American Susannah Scaroni won her first Boston title despite having to stop early to tighten a wheel that began to wobble on the bumpy pavement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to pull over losing that time tightening it,\" she said. \"The speed you lose when your wheel is (loose) is much greater than the time you would lose by not tightening it. I was disappointed. I just tried to get back to the ... pace as quickly as I could.\u201d\n\nKae Ravichandran finished in 2:38:57 to win the new nonbinary category, which included 27 entrants. Runner-up Cal Calamia, who wore a transgender patch on their singlet, said they heard spectators cheering for them all along the course.\n\n\u201cTo be able to do it in this way, in this category, makes it so much more special,\u201d said Calamia, who was running their sixth marathon and first Boston. \u201cKnowing how much work has gone into getting this category \u2014 in a way, that was already a win.\u201d\n\nAlso running were former Boston Bruins captain Zdeno Chara, who finished in 3:38:23, and celebrity chef Daniel Humm, with a time of 2:58:53. Olympic tennis gold medalist Monica Rakitt, who was known as Monica Puig when she won the Rio Games, wore bib No. 2016 and finished in 3:49:47.\n\nHeisman Trophy winner Doug Flutie, who wore No. 22 at Boston College and No. 2 for much of his NFL career, had bib No. 222 while finishing in 5:28:34.\n\nChara, who wore No. 33 for the Bruins, had bib No. 3333.\n\nNo one was assigned bib No. 2013 in remembrance of the 2013 finish line bombings that killed three people and wounded hundreds more. The race included 264 members of the One Fund community \u2014 those injured by the attack, their friends and family and charities associated with them.\n\nThe city marked the anniversary in a ceremony on Saturday.\n\nA robotic dog named Stompy belonging to the Department of Homeland Security patrolled the start line before the race began, trailed by photographers capturing the peculiar sight. Officials said there were no known threats.\n\nAt 6 a.m., race director Dave McGillivray sent out a group of about 20 from the Massachusetts National Guard that hikes the course on the state holiday of Patriots' Day commemorating the start of the Revolutionary War.\n\nCapt. Kanwar Singh, 33, of Malden, Massachusetts, said the race reminds him of Boston's resilience.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, the city came to a halt. It\u2019s an incredibly strong comeback, as a group together,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell people, never bet against Bostonians.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/hub/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "tags": ["marathoner", "marathons", "marathon"]}]
