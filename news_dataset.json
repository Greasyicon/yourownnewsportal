(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nActors represented by the Hollywood union SAG-AFTRA voted to authorize a strike if the major studios, streamers and production companies don\u2019t meet their demands for a new contract by June 30\n\nActors represented by the Hollywood union SAG-AFTRA voted Monday evening to authorize a strike if they don't agree on a new contract with major studios, streamers and production companies by June 30.\n\nThe strike authorization was approved by an overwhelming margin \u2014 nearly 98% of the 65,000 members who cast votes.\n\nThe guild, which represents over 160,000 screen actors, broadcast journalists, announcers, hosts and stunt performers, begins its negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers on Wednesday, over a month after the Writers Guild of America began striking over its own dispute with AMPTP. If the actors union ultimately moves forward with the strike, it would be limited to television and film productions; news and broadcast work would not be directly affected.\n\nAt stake is increased base compensation, which actors say has been undercut by inflation and the streaming ecosystem, the threat of unregulated use of artificial intelligence, benefit plans and the burden of \u201cself-taped auditions\u201d \u2014 the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production.\n\n\u201cWe are approaching these negotiations with the goal of achieving a new agreement that is beneficial to SAG-AFTRA members and the industry overall,\u201d the AMPTP said in a statement Monday.\n\nThe strike authorization vote, a tool at the bargaining table, comes at a pivotal moment for the industry as 11,500 writers enter their sixth week of striking and the directors guild reviews a recently reached tentative agreement with studios on issues like wages, streaming residuals, and artificial intelligence. Should the actors strike, the industry already hobbled by the writers strike would come to a near-standstill, from production to promoting completed projects.\n\nThe WGA, DGA and SAG-AFTRA have shown solidarity with one another since the writers began walking the picket lines on May 2. Many in Hollywood worried about the very real possibility that all three guilds would strike at the same time, as both the directors and the actors contracts were soon due to expire as well.\n\nThat scenario changed Sunday night when the directors guild, which represents 19,000 film, television and commercial directors, announced that they had reached a \u201ctruly historic\u201d tentative agreement with studios. The terms, which have not been disclosed in detail to the press or the other guilds, will be presented to the DGA board on Tuesday for approval and then to the membership for ratification.\n\nRepresentatives for both the writers guild and the actors guild congratulated the directors group for reaching a tentative deal, though neither commented on specific points of the DGA terms. The WGA also said that its bargaining positions remain the same.\n\nThe DGA deal did not sit well with some individual WGA members, some of whom remembered when the directors negotiated their own contract while the writers were striking in 2007-2008. That deal 15 years ago, some felt, set precedent that forced the writers to fall in line with the terms agreed to by the DGA and end the strike.\n\n\u201cZero surprise. The AMPTP continues to use their tired old playbook. And the DGA sadly continues to toe the line, knowing that they can draft off of the WGA\u2019s resolve to strike for a truly historic deal. Disappointing, but not surprising,\u201d veteran television writer Steven DeKnight, who also wrote and directed \u201cPacific Rim: Uprising,\u201d tweeted.\n\nSeemingly anticipating a repeat, the WGA negotiating committee last week released a letter cautioning that the studios would once again pursue a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d strategy, pitting the guilds against one another.\n\n\u201cOur position is clear: to resolve the strike, the companies will have to negotiate with the WGA on our full agenda,\u201d the WGA letter had said. \u201cWe will continue to march until the companies negotiate fairly with us.\u201d\n\nWhile the unions have appeared more united this time, their aims are also different in many arenas. For the directors, securing international streaming residuals that account for subscriber growth was a key component, as were wages, safety (like banning live ammunition on set), diversity and inclusion and the addition of Juneteenth as a paid holiday.\n\nThe WGA agenda includes increased pay, better residuals and minimum staffing requirements. One key area of overlap between all is artificial intelligence. The DGA said they\u2019d reached a \u201cgroundbreaking agreement confirming that AI is not a person and that generative AI cannot replace the duties performed by members.\u201d\n\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, maintains the needs of the guild's actor members are unique. Hollywood actors haven't gone on strike against AMPTP since 1980, which saw a 95-day strike over terms for paid television and VHS tapes.\n\n\u201cOur bargaining strategy has never relied upon nor been dependent on the outcome or status of any other union\u2019s negotiations, nor do we subscribe to the philosophy that the terms of deals made with other unions bind us,\u201d Crabtree-Ireland said Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, he added that the vote was a \"clear statement that it\u2019s time for an evolution in this contract.\u201d", "summary": ["The strike authorization vote, a tool at the bargaining table, comes at a pivotal moment for the industry as 11,500 writers enter their sixth week of striking and the directors guild reviews a recently reached tentative agreement with studios on issues like wages, streaming residuals, and artificial intelligence.", "(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nActors and comedians Tina Fey, center, and Fred Armisen, right, join striking members of the Writers Guild of America on the picket line, during a rally outside Silvercup Studios, Tuesday May 9, 2023, in New York.", "(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nActors and comedians Tina Fey, center, and Fred Armisen, right, join striking members of the Writers Guild of America on the picket line, during a rally outside Silvercup Studios, Tuesday May 9, 2023, in New York.", "(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)\n\nActors and comedians Tina Fey, center, and Fred Armisen, right, join striking members of the Writers Guild of America on the picket line, during a rally outside Silvercup Studios, Tuesday May 9, 2023, in New York.", "At stake is increased base compensation, which actors say has been undercut by inflation and the streaming ecosystem, the threat of unregulated use of artificial intelligence, benefit plans and the burden of \u201cself-taped auditions\u201d \u2014 the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production."], "tags": ["comedians", "juneteenth", "tuesday", "2023", "wednesday"]}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "Microsoft will pay $20M to settle U.S. charges of illegally collecting children's data", "text": "Microsoft will pay a fine of $20 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it illegally collected and retained the data of children who signed up to use its Xbox video game console\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Microsoft will pay a fine of $20 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it illegally collected and retained the data of children who signed up to use its Xbox video game console.\n\nThe agency charged that Microsoft gathered the data without notifying parents or obtaining their consent, and that it also illegally held onto the data.

In May, Beijing appointed an ambassador to the U.S. after the post was left vacant for months and sent a delegation to Detroit to participate in trade talks.\n\nOfficials from both countries also see the recent visit by U.S. officials to Beijing as an important precursor for rescheduling Secretary of State Antony Blinken's trip the city, which was scrapped in February after a Chinese surveillance balloon was identified over the U.S. mainland.\n\nSources say that getting that trip back on track is something that both countries want to see happen, and that it may be added to the calendar before the end of the summer.\n\nWhile there are examples of progress in the bilateral relationship, American officials have warned that a gap in military-to-military communication may still result in a dangerous blind spot, which could lead to additional close-calls between countries and dangerous escalation.\n\n\"It won't be long before somebody gets hurt,\" Kirby said of the intercepts. \"They can lead to misunderstandings.

Av disse skal omtrent 20 av sakene dreie seg om spesialtrente soldater i h\u00e6rens spesialstyrker, ogs\u00e5 kjent som KSK.

Dette er snakk om sv\u00e6rt godt trente elitesoldater, s\u00e5 det er alarmerende, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-ledelsen har f\u00e5tt beskjed fra tyske myndigheter om at store endringer m\u00e5 gjennomf\u00f8res innen oktober.\n\nOppl\u00f8ste en del av spesialstyrkene\n\nI kj\u00f8lvannet av politiaksjonen mot sersjanten ble det satt ned en komit\u00e9 som skulle unders\u00f8ke utbredelsen av h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger i KSK. Funnene til komiteen f\u00f8rte til at Tysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, i forrige uke ga ledelsen i KSK klar beskjed: Rydd opp i egne rekker innen oktober.\n\n\u2013 KSK kan ikke fortsette i sin n\u00e5v\u00e6rende form, sa Kramp-Karrenbauer p\u00e5 en pressekonferanse.\n\nHun beskrev kulturen i spesialstyrkene som \u00abusunn elitisme\u00bb og med \u00abgiftig lederskap\u00bb, if\u00f8lge BBC.\n\nSpesialstyrkene f\u00e5r ikke dra p\u00e5 internasjonale oppdrag f\u00f8r b\u00e5de rekrutteringen, treningen og ledelsesmetodene har f\u00e5tt en overhaling.\n\nI tillegg kunngjorde forsvarsministeren en reform med drastiske tiltak. Blant annet fjernes en av KSKs fire enheter. Der hadde h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger f\u00e5tt s\u00e5 kraftig fotfeste at det eneste man kunne gj\u00f8re var \u00e5 legge den ned.\n\nTysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, er fast bestemt p\u00e5 \u00e5 f\u00e5 has p\u00e5 h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger innad i landets milit\u00e6rstyrker.\n\nFakta KSK Tysklands elitestyrke med spesialtrente soldater har siden 1996 v\u00e6rt en del av den tyske h\u00e6ren, Bundeswehr. Styrkene fokuserer p\u00e5 operasjoner i forbindelse med antiterror og gisseltagning i farlige omr\u00e5der. Styrkene har blant annet blitt sendt til Afghanistan og Balkan. Operasjonene blir hemmeligholdt. Vis mer\n\nKan v\u00e6re kroken p\u00e5 d\u00f8ren om det ikke gj\u00f8res endringer\n\nDet ble ogs\u00e5 rapportert at spesialstyrkene ikke kunne gj\u00f8re rede for hvor hele 62 kilo med eksplosiver og 48.000 patroner hadde blitt av. Dette var spesielt alarmerende med tanke p\u00e5 funnet i hagen til sersjanten, uttalte Kramp-Karrenbauer. Hun krever n\u00e5 at spesialstyrkene finner ut hvor resten av arsenalet er blitt av.\n\nProfessor Masala tror det kan bli kroken for d\u00f8ren for KSK om man ikke ser konkrete endringer de neste m\u00e5nedene.\n\n\u2013 Vi har en forsvarsminister som er sv\u00e6rt dedikert til saken og \u00f8nsker \u00e5 komme roten av problemet til livs. Hun mener alvor. Jeg tror derfor det vil komme store endringer i styrkene. KSK-ledelsen har ikke noe valg, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-soldat sendte brev om \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb i egen avdeling\n\nAnklager om ekstremisme innad i landets elitestyrke fikk oppmerksomhet allerede i 2017. Da skal flere KSK-soldater ha saluttert med \u00abHitler-hilsen\u00bb og spilt nynazistisk rockemusikk p\u00e5 en avskjedsfest for en av sjefene.\n\nS\u00e5 sent som i juni sendte en ung KSK-soldat brev til forsvarsministeren hvor han innstendig ba henne sette i gang en etterforskning av sin egen avdeling. Han beskrev en \u00abgiftig kultur av aksept\u00bb og \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb,. Ekstreme holdninger blant hans medsoldater ble ignorert, og tidvis, akseptert, if\u00f8lge soldaten, skriver New York Times.\n\nDe tyske spesialstyrkene har i lang tid f\u00e5tt operere frittst\u00e5ende, utenfor resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Det har f\u00f8rt til en form for elitisme, mener eksperter.\n\nElitisme og d\u00e5rlig lederskap preger milj\u00f8et\n\nProfessor Masala mener lojalitet og feilsl\u00e5tt lederskap gj\u00f8r at ekstreme holdninger kan f\u00e5 vokse frem i en tropp med hovedoppgave \u00e5 takle Tysklands farligste oppdrag.\n\n\u2013 Disse spesialstyrkene lever i store perioder helt avsk\u00e5ret fra omverdenen. N\u00e5r man er p\u00e5 hemmelige, livsfarlige oppdrag sammen, er du er n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 kunne stole fullt og helt p\u00e5 sidemannen. Det skaper et helt spesielt b\u00e5nd og lojalitet til hverandre. Det blir en slags milit\u00e6r kult. Da tyster man ikke p\u00e5 hverandre, sier Masala.\n\n\u2013 Du har ogs\u00e5 KSK-ledere som mener milit\u00e6ret og opptrening skal v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt aggressiv og maskulin. I tillegg har KSK frem til n\u00e5 f\u00e5tt operere ganske frittst\u00e5ende fra resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Da utvikler det seg en holdning om at man er mer spesiell enn andre. Mange av soldatene blir i styrken i 15\u201320 \u00e5r, s\u00e5 man f\u00e5r f\u00e5 impulser utenfra, fortsetter professoren.\n\nDet har ogs\u00e5 blitt spekulert i om fremveksten av det h\u00f8yreorienterte partiet Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) p\u00e5 den politiske arenaen, kan linkes til h\u00f8yreekstremisme innad i forsvarsrekkene.

Now, Beijing is reaching for the diplomatic status that matches its position as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy.\n\nIn a speech at a United Nations conference held to mark the 50-year anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s joining the UN, Xi addressed China\u2019s diplomatic rise and spoke of Beijing\u2019s commitment to a world order defined by the pursuit of peace, democracy and human rights as well as the rejection of unilateralism, foreign interference and power politics.\n\nIn mid-March, at a so-called dialogue meeting between global political parties in Beijing, Xi reinforced his commitment to the same principles.\n\nIn his keynote speech, Xi introduced the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) as a way of formalising these principles with the added purpose of encouraging countries to \u201cfully harness the relevance of their histories and cultures\u201d and \u201cappreciate the perceptions of values by different civilizations and refrain from imposing their own values or models on others\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the previously proposed Global Development Initiative (GDI) and Global Security Initiative (GSI), the GCI appears to encapsulate \u2013 although in amorphous terms \u2013 much of the Chinese president\u2019s overall vision for a new international order.\n\nYao Yuan Yeh teaches Chinese Studies at the University of St Thomas in the United States. According to him, such an order would partly supplant and partly remould the international system into a new set of structures that better align with the worldview of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\n\n\u201cIt would be a world order that does not constrain communist China but contributes to its rise,\u201d he said.\n\nAn alternative narrative\n\nThe purpose of the dialogue meeting in March was, to some extent, to act as a Chinese counterpart to the Summit for Democracy that the United States held for a second time that month as part of an effort to rally the world\u2019s democracies.\n\nWhile leaders from Mongolia, Serbia and South Africa were invited to both events, the US summit mostly included traditional Washington allies, while the gathering in Beijing included leaders from Kazakhstan, Russia, Sudan and Venezuela.\n\nThe Chinese leadership and state media portrayed the CCP\u2019s dialogue meeting as part of China\u2019s vision of embracing countries across the world, which includes maintaining or even deepening diplomatic contact with nations like Russia and Myanmar.\n\nThe Chinese government\u2019s willingness to engage with a variety of world actors has indeed been on display in recent months.\n\nChinese diplomacy played a role in the rapprochement between Iran and Saudi Arabia in March. Also in March, the Chinese foreign minister visited Myanmar coup leader Min Aung Hlaing, while Xi travelled to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn April, Xi held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and, last month, his envoy attempted to build support for a Beijing-led plan to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. Beijing has also been mentioned as a potential peace broker in conflict-ravaged Sudan.\n\nAndy Mok, a senior research fellow at the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization, says the Chinese approach to international relations is defined by a live-and-let-live mindset.\n\n\u201cIt is less defined by shared values and more defined by a shared future,\u201d he told Al Jazeera.\n\nThat means that while Western countries sometimes condition interactions and cooperation on adherence to a set of values, China wants to base its engagements on the potential for development and future benefits, Mok said.\n\nThe policy largely follows a CCP conviction that development and prosperity do not have to lead to adopting these \u2013 so-called Western \u2013 values. The Chinese leadership has frequently criticised \u201ccertain countries\u201d for supposedly imposing their principles onto others and lacking respect for the ways non-Western nations with different cultures and traditions run their affairs.\n\nBeijing\u2019s world order would be defined by multipolarity, according to Mok, who says China has no plan to be a dominant power.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a change in the world order being a case of a new boss simply replacing the old boss.\u201d\n\nReconfiguring the existing world order\n\nAlthough the Chinese leadership regularly opposes the imposition of Western values, this does not mean Beijing wants to discard democracy, human rights and the rule of law on the global stage, according to the Chinese government.\n\nUsing China as an example, Xi has claimed that China is \u201cdemocratic\u201d because the CCP and the state represent the people and run the country on behalf of the people to promote the will of the people. Chinese state media have insisted that liberal democracies neglect the needs of the people by measuring democracy \u201conly\u201d on the basis of electoral cycles.\n\nBeijing also points to its poverty alleviation and strategy against COVID-19 as examples of the government\u2019s commitment to human rights.\n\n\u201cThey see these values as more relative terms and have in their own view provided a more inclusive definition of them with freedom from hunger and freedom from fear for your life being seen as examples of more basic human rights,\u201d Mok said.\n\nThe modern understanding of human rights can be traced back to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which details a set of basic rights and freedoms seen as inherent, inalienable and applicable to all people.\n\nAdopted in the early years of the UN, the rights were enshrined into the foundation of the international system. Since then, more than 70 human rights treaties have sprouted from the UDHR, many of which have been signed and ratified by China.\n\nTrying to reinterpret the language on human rights and democracy is therefore not something to be taken lightly, according to Elaine Pearson, the director of the Asia division of the rights organisation Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\n\u201cIt is not up to individual states to redefine human rights as they like,\u201d Pearson told Al Jazeera.\n\n\u201cTotalitarian North Korea also calls itself the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of North Korea \u2013 simply saying something doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d\n\nHRW warned in 2020 that Beijing was trying to bring about change within the UN, not only by trying to redefine established principles but also by hampering investigations and diluting condemnations of human rights abuses around the world.\n\nIts efforts come at a time when international NGOs and UN bodies have expressed deep concern about the violation of basic freedoms and rights in China.\n\nBeijing has fired back at such concerns.\n\nWhen a UN report was released last year detailing possible \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d by the Chinese state against the mostly Muslim Uighurs in the far western Xinjiang region, Beijing responded with a report of its own. It accused alleged anti-China forces in the US and other Western countries of feigning concern for human rights and claimed they wanted to use the Uighur issue to \u201cdestabilise Xinjiang and suppress China\u201d.\n\nA vote in October at the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council to debate the issue, however, was narrowly defeated.\n\nFollowing the vote, human rights group Amnesty International accused the council of failing to uphold its core mission: protecting the victims of human rights violations everywhere.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese government has gained more global influence in recent years and has been able to turn that influence into a greater sway at established international institutions,\u201d Liselotte Odgaard, a professor of China Relations at the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, told Al Jazeera.\n\nAdditionally, Beijing has used its veto power in the UN Security Council to block resolutions and statements condemning the military coup in Myanmar and hinder new sanctions on North Korea, while abstaining from condemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides developing a greater say in traditional global institutions, Beijing has also founded new institutions to further its credibility as an international player.\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road Fund have all been spearheaded by China, have headquarters in China and have been called alternatives to established global institutions such as the UN, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBut they should not necessarily be seen as an attempt by Beijing to replace existing international institutions, according to St Thomas\u2019s Yeh.\n\nAs UN cases show, Beijing has channelled considerable effort into reshaping established institutions as well. At the same time, China is the second-biggest donor of funds to the UN and one of only five members of the security council with permanent veto powers.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing Beijing working both inside and outside established structures, depending on what is most conducive to their goals,\u201d said Yeh.\n\nPursuing the Chinese Dream\n\nThe ultimate goal is achieving the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation also known as the Chinese Dream \u2013 a vision closely associated with President Xi since his early days in office.\n\nThe Chinese Dream represents Beijing\u2019s quest to regain its prestige \u2013 damaged in the \u2018Century of Humiliation\u2019 by the imperial powers in the late 19th and early 20th century \u2013 and turn China into an advanced, world-leading nation by 2049.\n\nThis includes developing China internally but also expanding the territory under the PRC into areas currently beyond its direct control that are nonetheless considered inalienable parts of the Chinese nation.\n\nThis includes disputed territory along the land border with India and Bhutan, the Senkaku islands (that China calls Diaoyudao) administered by Japan in the East China Sea as well as most of the South China Sea where Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam have rival claims.\n\nAbove all else, however, China\u2019s rejuvenation means unification with Taiwan and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this goal.\n\nWhen the Chinese military conducts large-scale exercises around Taiwan or when Chinese vessels intercept ships from other countries in the South China Sea, Beijing argues these are not breaches of China\u2019s international pledges but examples of China upholding sovereignty over territory that rightfully belongs to the Chinese nation.\n\nOn the world stage, the Chinese government has repeatedly condemned violations of national sovereignty, foreign interference in other nations\u2019 affairs and the unilateral use of economic sanctions.\n\nBut at the same time, it reserves the right to look past international rulings that go against it \u2013 such as the 2016 international court ruling that its historic claim to the South China Sea had \u201cno legal basis\u201d \u2013 and take action against those perceived to stand between Beijing and its path towards national rejuvenation.\n\nWhen Lithuania in 2021 allowed the opening of a \u201cTaiwan Representative Office\u201d rather than the usual \u201cTaipei Economic and Cultural Office\u201d in Vilnius, Beijing was furious. Seeing such a naming convention as encouraging Taiwanese independence, it imposed severe economic sanctions on the Baltic state.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even as Beijing touts \u201cnon-interference\u201d for itself and others, it has itself been accused of engaging in interference abroad.\n\nIn Canada, a leaked intelligence report revealed in early May that Chinese authorities had allegedly been involved in an intimidation campaign against a Canadian MP and his family in Hong Kong after he sponsored a successful motion declaring the Chinese treatment of the Uighurs a genocide.\n\nPrevious Canadian intelligence leaks have led to allegations that Beijing attempted to interfere in the Canadian general elections of 2019 and 2021 to secure the defeat of anti-Beijing candidates.\n\nChinese diplomatic staff have also been accused of election interference in Denmark, while consular staff in Manchester, England\u2019s second-biggest city, were accused of employing physical violence to disrupt a demonstration outside the Chinese consulate.\n\nIn all these cases, Chinese officials have denied engaging in any sort of tampering, claiming instead that forces with \u201chidden agendas\u201d were \u201cfabricating lies\u201d to \u201csmear\u201d China. At the same time, the Chinese government says it reserves the right to defend its sovereignty and act against those that attempt to interfere in China\u2019s domestic matters.\n\nAs Xi allegedly told US President Biden regarding US engagement with Taiwan during a phone call last year: \u201cThose that play with fire get burned.\u201d", "summary": ["\u201cTotalitarian North Korea also calls itself the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of North Korea \u2013 simply saying something doesn\u2019t make it true.\u201d\n\nHRW warned in 2020 that Beijing was trying to bring about change within the UN, not only by trying to redefine established principles but also by hampering investigations and diluting condemnations of human rights abuses around the world.", "In a speech at a United Nations conference held to mark the 50-year anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s joining the UN, Xi addressed China\u2019s diplomatic rise and spoke of Beijing\u2019s commitment to a world order defined by the pursuit of peace, democracy and human rights as well as the rejection of unilateralism, foreign interference and power politics.", "But at the same time, it reserves the right to look past international rulings that go against it \u2013 such as the 2016 international court ruling that its historic claim to the South China Sea had \u201cno legal basis\u201d \u2013 and take action against those perceived to stand between Beijing and its path towards national rejuvenation.", "In his keynote speech, Xi introduced the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI) as a way of formalising these principles with the added purpose of encouraging countries to \u201cfully harness the relevance of their histories and cultures\u201d and \u201cappreciate the perceptions of values by different civilizations and refrain from imposing their own values or models on others\u201d.", "\u201cI don\u2019t see a change in the world order being a case of a new boss simply replacing the old boss.\u201d\n\nReconfiguring the existing world order\n\nAlthough the Chinese leadership regularly opposes the imposition of Western values, this does not mean Beijing wants to discard democracy, human rights and the rule of law on the global stage, according to the Chinese government."], "tags": ["beijing", "china", "shanghai", "remould", "reconfiguring"]}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Zelenskyy lauds Ukraine advance amid counteroffensive speculation", "text": "Kyiv has kept silent on start of counteroffensive despite speculation by analysts that campaign is getting under way.\n\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has praised his troops after Ukrainian forces pressed forward in several sections of the front line with Russia amid speculation the increased combat activities may signal that Kyiv\u2019s long-expected counteroffensive is getting under way.\n\nIn his nightly video address on Monday, Zelenskyy mocked what he described as Russia\u2019s hysterical reaction to every operation undertaken by Ukrainian forces and singled out two Ukrainian units who \u201cskilfully, decisively and effectively defend our positions, destroy the occupiers and, most importantly, move forward\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to each of our warriors, to all our defenders who gave us the news we expect.

Shireen Abu Akleh.\n\nDemocrat Chris Van Hollen said on Monday that he had reviewed the report by the US Security Coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority (USSC) \u2014 weeks after he requested it from the State Department.\n\nBut Van Hollen said he now wants it declassified \u201cin its entirety\u201d.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that its public release is vital to ensuring transparency and accountability in the shooting death of American citizen and journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and to avoiding future preventable and wrongful deaths \u2014 goals we should all

West Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, Israeli officials falsely accused Palestinian gunmen of fatally shooting Abu Akleh before acknowledging months later that she was likely killed by an Israeli soldier.\n\nStill, Israel has dismissed the incident as unintentional and has not opened a criminal probe into the killing \u2014 prompting calls for the US, a staunch Israeli ally, to conduct its own investigation and seek accountability in the case.\n\nVan Hollen said on Monday that the USSC, which oversees and encourages security coordination between Israeli and Palestinian officials, was not granted access to key witnesses and was \u201cunable to conduct an independent investigation\u201d into the killing.\n\nStill, the senator said the report provides \u201cvery important insights\u201d into the incident, including on the Israeli unit involved in the operation that led to Abu Akleh\u2019s death, \u201cas well as other [Israeli military] units operating in the West Bank\u201d.\n\nThe report is described as a \u201csummation\u201d document on other investigations of the incident.\n\nIn July 2022, the State Department cited an initial USSC summary of the probes conducted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which said that Israeli gunfire was \u201clikely responsible\u201d for Abu Akleh\u2019s death, though it found no reason to believe the shooting was intentional.\n\nThe assessment angered Palestinian rights supporters who noted that US authorities did not interview witnesses and ignored the PA\u2019s conclusion that the shooting was deliberate.\n\nThe USSC report, which Van Hollen said on Monday he had reviewed, is believed to be a more thorough accounting of the US government\u2019s findings. Specific details of the report, including when it was finalised and what it includes, remain unclear.\n\nSearch for answers\n\nWitnesses, video footage and investigations by numerous media outlets have concluded there was no fighting in the immediate vicinity of where Abu Akleh \u2014 who was in full press gear \u2014 was fatally shot.\n\nIn the months since, Van Hollen and other American legislators have called for a US probe into the incident.\n\nLate last year, Israeli and US media outlets reported that the FBI was investigating the killing, but US authorities \u2014 including the Justice and State departments \u2014 have refused to confirm or deny the existence of the purported probe.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS officials initially called for accountability in the case, including prosecuting Abu Akleh\u2019s killers to the \u201cfullest extent\u201d of the law.\n\nWeeks after the shooting, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also said that Washington was looking for an \u201cindependent\u201d investigation into the killing.\n\nBut Washington appeared to drop that demand last year. Instead, the State Department now says it is seeking accountability by calling on Israel to review its military rules of engagement \u2014 a demand Israeli leaders have openly rejected.\n\n\u201cIn the aftermath of the death of Shireen Abu Akleh, Secretary Blinken has asked the Government of Israel to review the [military] rules of engagement in the West Bank, but he has been rebuffed \u2014 such a review remains necessary,\u201d Van Hollen said in Monday\u2019s statement.\n\nLast month, on the first anniversary of Abu Akleh\u2019s killing, the Al Jazeera journalist\u2019s family met with lawmakers in Washington, DC to renew calls for justice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just that the Biden administration hasn\u2019t done anything to achieve justice for Shireen;

Four years of Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s reactionary politics had undermined Western engagement with Brazil and worried Western liberal democracies about the resurgence of far-right politics in South America.\n\nThe staunch support Lula received from Western capitals, especially from Washington, when Bolsonaro\u2019s followers attacked government buildings in the Brazilian capital shortly after the inauguration, was meant to solidify this \u201creset\u201d in relations.\n\nBut when the United States and its European allies pressed the Brazilian president to take a stance on the raging war in Ukraine, the response they got was not what they had hoped for.\n\nApart from voting in favour of a United Nations resolution condemning the Russian aggression, Brazil under the new administration did not take a clear side in the conflict.\n\nLula refused to enter the anti-Russia camp by joining the sanctions regime or arming Ukraine and continued to toe the neutrality line set by his right-wing predecessor.\n\nTo expect Brazil to fully align with the West on the war in Ukraine is, of course, na\u00efve. From a Global South perspective, Lula\u2019s stance makes sense. He is not only defending vital national interests related to Brazilian agribusiness, but is also ideologically consistent with the neutral position Brazil occupies in global politics.\n\nYet, domestic concerns and diplomatic continuity should not prevent the Brazilian government from extending solidarity to Ukraine, the victim of aggression by a former colonial power.\n\nDomestic considerations\n\nDuring his election campaign in 2022, Lula banked on his previous success and raised hopes among Brazil\u2019s poor that his new administration will repeat past socioeconomic policies.\n\nDuring his first two terms (2003-10), the global boom in commodity prices allowed his government to boost public spending. The extra revenues were redirected to massive income transfer policies, like Bolsa Familia, the social programme which became his trademark and which lifted about 36 million people out of extreme poverty.\n\nBut today, the situation in Brazil is quite different, considering the internal political polarisations and difficult economic situation marked by high inflation, slow growth and a sluggish private sector.\n\nThat is why, when putting together his foreign policy, Lula has to keep in mind the economic interests of industries, which contribute large chunks of state revenue. When examining relations with Russia, one of the key sectors to consider is agribusiness, which accounts for about 25 percent of the Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) and 48 percent of the country\u2019s total exports.\n\nThe productivity of Brazilian agriculture depends on the massive use of fertilisers, especially NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium compounds). Brazil is the largest importer of NPK in the world, and Russia is its biggest seller, meeting 22 percent of Brazilian demand.\n\nJoining the Western sanctions regime on Moscow would certainly disrupt the steady supply of Russian fertilisers and affect agricultural exports. This in turn would not only anger big agribusiness which has a sizable lobby in the Brazilian parliament, but would also affect the government revenue stream from agricultural exports.\n\nLula\u2019s calculations are simple: To finance social policies and recover the electorate that swung to the extreme right, he needs economic stability and sources of revenue; the trade relationship with Russia plays a significant role in this equation.\n\nNon-alignment in the 21st century\n\nBrazil under Lula is not alone in pursuing its own interests when considering its position on the war in Ukraine. Governments across the Global South do not want to get involved because they think they stand to lose a lot if they do.\n\nLast year, the war and the subsequent sanctions took a toll on poorer countries as the prices of grains and fuel skyrocketed. Developing nations can ill afford to stoke the crisis further by taking sides in a war that concerns them little and potentially threatens their supplies of grain.\n\nAcross the Global South, there is a general feeling that Europe and the US are disregarding global economic stability and the wellbeing of poorer nations in their rush to arm and aid Ukraine.\n\nMany also perceive the Western backing for Kyiv as a continuation of the long record of Western interventions across the world. In this sense, the Brazilian government and others in the Global South do not see the West as having the moral authority to demand support for their military efforts in Ukraine. The locus classicus of this line of reasoning is the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Washington launched, despite having no authorisation from the UN Security Council.\n\nIn the context of growing tensions between the West and China and Russia, Lula has attempted to establish a geopolitical ground analogous to the non-aligned movement during the Cold War. In foreign visits, he has emphasised Brazil\u2019s neutrality and has called for South-South solidarity, even calling for the de-dollarisation of international trade.\n\nHe has appealed for peace, proposing a new initiative \u2013 a \u201cpeace club\u201d in an effort to jumpstart negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nMoscow has given a nod to the initiative, but Kyiv has rejected it outright, while the US has accused the Brazilian leader of \u201cparroting Russian and Chinese propaganda\u201d.\n\nLula\u2019s subsequent comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are both to blame for the war and that Ukraine will have to give up its claim on the Crimean Peninsula have not helped. Attempts at damage control by the presidency, clearly condemning the Russian invasion of Ukraine and declining the Russian invitation to participate in the St Petersburg Economic Forum have not worked.\n\nLula\u2019s attempt at conjuring a new non-aligned movement has failed and, in the process, he seems to have lost some of the international standing he had built during his previous terms.\n\nThe pitfall of Third-Worldism\n\nThere is a contradiction in Lula\u2019s appeal for a 21st-century Third-Worldism vis-\u00e0-vis the war in Ukraine. Although he is right to criticise Western interventionism, his critique falls short when considering Ukrainian history and current standing.\n\nThe country, one of the poorest in Europe, has a brutal colonial past similar to Brazil\u2019s and the rest of Latin America\u2019s. It is not, by any means, a nation of the Global North, which has enriched itself through the domination of other peoples.\n\nAt the same time, Ukraine cannot be reduced to a victim of forced Westernisation or a NATO puppet. Doing so would ignore the Ukrainian struggle for national liberation and independence and would legitimise Russian aggression and colonialist pretences.\n\nIn this sense, were Brazil to extend support to Ukraine, it would be an expression of South-South solidarity \u2013 one that sees through the propaganda from Western, but also from Eastern powers.\n\nIn extending a hand to Kyiv, Lula can reject not only the simplistic Western narrative of \u201cWestern liberal democracy vs Eastern authoritarianism\u201d, but also the equally hypocritical discourse of \u201cthe West vs the rest\u201d that turns a blind eye to aggression by regional powers, autocratic brutality, and repression of minorities in the Global South.\n\nThe Brazilian government also cannot ignore the growing evidence of shocking war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, which is refuting any claims of symmetry within this conflict. Lula cannot present himself as a messenger of peace, leading a country historically committed to human rights and social justice, while disregarding major violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.\n\nThe Russian aggression in Ukraine and the apologetic narrative of the Kremlin are challenging the legitimacy of the international legal system that the Brazilian state, a UN founding member, has supported since 1945. Putin\u2019s multi-imperialist vision of the world in which nuclear powers divide it into spheres of influence directly contradicts the multilateralism and egalitarianism that Brazil has defended for the past 75 years.\n\nLula seems to be trapped in old Cold War dilemmas in a world that is no longer bipolar. The alternative to the unilateralism of US President George W Bush that marked the invasion of Iraq in 2003 cannot be the multi-imperialism of Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIf the Brazilian president really wishes to promote multilateralism and uphold international law, then he must unequivocally express solidarity with Ukraine and condemn Russian aggression. From this position, he can then proceed to lead multinational mediation efforts, putting together a coalition of willing partners along with China and India.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial stance", "summary": ["In extending a hand to Kyiv, Lula can reject not only the simplistic Western narrative of \u201cWestern liberal democracy vs Eastern authoritarianism\u201d, but also the equally hypocritical discourse of \u201cthe West vs the rest\u201d that turns a blind eye to aggression by regional powers, autocratic brutality, and repression of minorities in the Global South.", "Lula\u2019s calculations are simple: To finance social policies and recover the electorate that swung to the extreme right, he needs economic stability and sources of revenue; the trade relationship with Russia plays a significant role in this equation.", "Lula\u2019s subsequent comments that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are both to blame for the war and that Ukraine will have to give up its claim on the Crimean Peninsula have not helped.", "The staunch support Lula received from Western capitals, especially from Washington, when Bolsonaro\u2019s followers attacked government buildings in the Brazilian capital shortly after the inauguration, was meant to solidify this \u201creset\u201d in relations.", "When examining relations with Russia, one of the key sectors to consider is agribusiness, which accounts for about 25 percent of the Brazilian gross domestic product (GDP) and 48 percent of the country\u2019s total exports."], "tags": ["president", "2022", "putin", "humanitarian", "brazil"]}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Latest Ukraine updates: Russia hits infiltrators at border", "text": "The live blog is now closed, thank you for joining us.

(June 6)\n\nMANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) \u2014 Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wasted no time going after Donald Trump while launching his presidential campaign on Tuesday, calling the former president and current Republican primary front-runner a \u201clonely, self-consumed, self-serving mirror hog\u201d and arguing that he\u2019s the only one who can stop him.\n\nChristie began his run with a town hall in New Hampshire. The former governor and federal prosecutor ran for president and lost to Trump in 2016 and went on to become a close off-and-on adviser before breaking with the former president over his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election.\n\nNow that Trump is trying again for the White House, Christie is out to do everything in his power to deny him. After criticizing other Republican primary rivals for being afraid to directly challenge Trump, Christie made clear that he had no such concerns.\n\n\u201cThe person I am talking about, who is obsessed with the mirror, who never admits a mistake, who never admits a fault, who always finds someone else and something else to blame for whatever goes wrong \u2014 but finds every reason to take credit for anything that goes right \u2014 is Donald Trump,\u201d he told a small, mostly friendly crowd at Saint Anselm College.\n\n\u201cA lonely, self-consumed, self-serving mirror hog is not a leader,\u201d Christie said, saying Trump \u201cmade us smaller by dividing us even further and pitting us one against the other.\u201d\n\nBut he also said President Joe Biden \u201cis doing the same thing, just on the other side.\u201d He noted that he\u2019d known Biden for decades and said the president is \u201cout of his depth\u201d because \u201che\u2019s not the guy he used to be,\u201d referencing the 80-year-old Biden\u2019s advanced age.\n\nBut Christie\u2019s chief target was Trump.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big argument in our country right now about whether character matters, and we have leaders who have shown us over and over again that not only are they devoid of character, they don\u2019t care.\u201d Christie said. \u201cWe can\u2019t dismiss the question of character anymore, everybody. If we do, we get what we deserve, and we will have to own it.\u201d\n\nChristie enters a growing primary field that already includes Trump, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley and U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Former Vice President Mike Pence will be formally launching his own campaign in Iowa on Wednesday.\n\nDuring his time as governor, Christie established a reputation as a fighter with a knack for creating viral moments of confrontation. But he faces an uphill battle to the nomination in a party that remains closely aligned with the former president, despite Trump\u2019s reelection loss in 2020 and Republicans\u2019 poorer-than-expected showing in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nChristie argues that unless top Republicans dare confront Trump, there will be a repeat of the 2016 GOP primary, when Trump rolled over a host of alternatives with more political experience who split the support of voters opposing him.\n\nChristie said Tuesday that the only way to win the GOP nomination was to topple Trump, but he was in the race to win the White House, not just the primary. He made fun of Trump\u2019s failed promise to wall off the entire southern U.S. border and have Mexico pay for it but said that voters who believed Trump in 2016 now knew better.\n\nAnti-Trump Republicans are particularly eager to see Christie spar with Trump on a debate stage \u2014 if, of course, Trump agrees to participate in primary debates and Christie meets the stringent fundraising criteria set by the Republican National Committee for participation.\n\nJP Marzullo, a former state representative and former vice chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, previously backed Trump but is now supporting Christie.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll actually unite some of the voters, and he\u2019ll get to independents,\u201d Marzullo said of the former governor, adding, \u201cI think it\u2019s time for a change.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign will test the appetite among Republican voters for someone who has expressed support for many of Trump\u2019s policies but has criticized the former president\u2019s conduct. The former governor has rejected Trump\u2019s lies that the 2020 election was stolen and has urged the party to move on or risk future losses.\n\nOther Republicans with similar views, including former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, have opted against their own campaigns, expressing concerns that having more candidates in the race will only benefit Trump.\n\nChristie was at one point seen as one of the Republican Party\u2019s brightest political stars as the popular Republican governor of a Democratic state. But despite persistent urging from top donors and party officials, he declined to run for president in 2012. By the time he announced in 2016, his reputation had been tarnished by the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal in which aides were accused of wreaking traffic havoc in Fort Lee, New Jersey, in an apparent effort to punish the city\u2019s mayor for failing to endorse his reelection bid.\n\nIn the packed 2016 GOP primary, Christie portrayed himself as a brash, tough-talking East Coaster who could \u201ctell it like it is\u201d \u2014 only to be eclipsed by the brasher Trump.\n\nChristie opting to start his 2024 bid at a New Hampshire town hall recalled his first run at the White House, when he focused on the state, holding dozens of New Hampshire town hall events only to finish sixth in its primary. He dropped out of that race afterward.\n\nTwo weeks later, Christie stunned even some former aides when he endorsed Trump , becoming the first sitting governor and former rival to get behind the emerging GOP front-runner. His announcement undercut rival Marco Rubio at a crucial moment \u2014 the day after a debate that had been seen as a possible turning point in the race \u2014 helping to pave the way for Trump\u2019s nomination and eventual win.\n\n\u201cThe line of supporting Donald Trump starts behind me,\u201d Christie has said.\n\nThe former governor, who has known Trump for nearly 20 years, has had a complicated friendship with the former developer and reality TV star. At times, he was one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers: He was on the shortlist to serve as Trump\u2019s vice president, oversaw Trump\u2019s early White House transition efforts, said he was offered \u2014 and turned down \u2014 multiple Cabinet positions, and helped Trump prepare for each of his general election debates in 2016 and 2020. (It was during those debate preparations that Christie believes he caught COVID-19, landing him in intensive care.)\n\nBut Christie also clashed with Trump at times and has described the former president\u2019s refusal to accept his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden as a breaking point. In appearances and interviews, Christie says he was \u201cincredibly disappointed and disillusioned\u201d by Trump\u2019s refusal to concede, which culminated in his followers\u2019 violent storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6 in an effort to halt the certification of Biden\u2019s win.\n\n___\n\nColvin reported from New York.

Being subjected to a torrent of racial abuse on social media in the aftermath made it even worse.\n\nMonkey emojis. Being told to go home. The N-word.\n\nThe even sadder part? Everyone knew it was coming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid,\u201d said Nedum Onuoha, a retired Black player who was in the top divisions of English and U.S. soccer for 16 years. \u201cBut are we surprised?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s the latest form of racism: technology-fueled, visual, permanently intrusive and 24/7 \u2014 a haunting reminder of the 1980s-style monkey chants and banana-throwing in a social media era.\n\nAnd it is spiraling out of control on platforms where anonymity is the golden ticket for racists.\n\n\u201cEvery time it happens, it knocks you back and floors you,\u201d Onuoha told The Associated Press. \u201cJust when you think everything is OK, it\u2019s a reminder that it\u2019s not. It\u2019s a reminder of how some people actually see you.\u201d\n\nRacism is the predominant form of abuse on social media reported to Kick It Out, an anti-discrimination campaigner in soccer, according to statistics compiled over the past three seasons in English soccer.\n\nA report last year from FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, showed that more than 50% of players competing in two international tournaments in 2021 \u2014 the African Cup of Nations and the European Championship \u2014 received some form of discriminatory abuse in more than 400,000 posts on social media. More than a third were of a racist nature.\n\nThe problem is, there\u2019s barely any accountability and it\u2019s so easy. Pull out your phone, find the handle of the player you want to abuse, and fire off a racist message.\n\nFormer Premier League striker Mark Bright, who is Black and regularly suffered racial abuse inside stadiums in the 1980s , was exchanging messages with friends on a WhatsApp group when those three Black players for England \u2014 Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho \u2014 missed penalties in a shootout loss to Italy in the 2020 European Championship final.\n\n\u201cWe all messaged each other and said, \u2018Oh God, here we go.\u2019 Because we know what\u2019s around the corner,\u201d Bright told the AP. \u201cThat\u2019s what we expected and this is where, once again, you say \u2018What can be done about it?\u2019\u201d\n\nLargely speaking, the abuse hasn\u2019t stopped Black players from using social media. It is an essential tool for marketing, leading to the paradox of soccer players using the same platforms on which they are abused.\n\nKylian Mbappe, who has 104 million followers on Instagram and more than 12 million followers on Twitter, was subjected to racial abuse along with fellow Black teammate Kingsley Coman after their French national team lost in the 2022 World Cup final to Argentina.\n\nReal Madrid winger Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior , who has repeatedly been the target of racial insults, is followed by 38 million people on Instagram and nearly 7 million on Twitter.\n\nSaka, who has more than 1 million followers on Twitter, remains on social media despite the abuse after England\u2019s Euro 2020 loss and more just a few weeks ago, when a message posted on Twitter showed the Arsenal winger with his face made to look like a monkey, alongside the words: \u201cThis clown has cost us the league.\u201d Minutes before the message, Saka had missed a penalty in an important Premier League game.\n\nWith social media continuing to fuel abuse, players and teams are coming up with ways to both raise awareness and reduce their exposure to offensive users.\n\nGoBubble is a company that configures AI software to act as a filter to stop discriminatory comments from being seen by a social media user. It has customers from the Premier League down to the fourth division in English soccer, around Europe and in Australia.\n\n\u201cYes, tech has caused the issue,\u201d GoBubble founder Henry Platten told the AP, \u201cbut tech can actually solve the issue and this is what we are seeing as one of those pieces of the jigsaw.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s AI technology is plugged into players\u2019 accounts and scans for toxic and potentially harmful words, images and other types of messages which can be filtered out using a traffic-light system.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about censorship, about sportswashing, about creating that fuzzy world,\u201d Platten said. \u201cThis is about protection, not just for the players and their families but also the wider fan community.\u201d\n\nPlatten said some players who approached him had experienced mental health issues that impacted their performances. Indeed, in January, Liverpool became the first Premier League club to hire a mental health consultant tasked with protecting young players from online trolling.\n\nGoverning bodies are reacting, too . During last year\u2019s World Cup in Qatar, FIFA and players\u2019 union FIFPRO had a dedicated in-tournament moderation service that prevented racist and other forms of hate speech from being seen online by players and their followers. This service will be offered for the upcoming Women\u2019s World Cup .\n\nSoccer authorities in England, including the Premier League, led a four-day social media boycott in 2021 across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram in a protest against racist abuse. It ended up being adopted by many other sports in England, and by FIFA and UEFA, the governing body of European soccer.\n\nStill, the abuse continues on the platforms, which have been accused of being too slow to block racist posts, remove offenders\u2019 accounts, and improve their verification process to ensure users provide accurate identification information and are barred from registering with a new account if banned.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be regulated, you need to be accountable,\u201d Bright said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s been complaining about this for a long time now. Some players have set up meetings with these social media companies. It seems to me that they\u2019re not serious enough about it.\u201d\n\nSo is there appetite for change within the big social media platforms?\n\n\u201cNo one should have to experience racist abuse, and we don\u2019t want it on our apps,\u201d Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, said in a statement to the AP. \u201cWe take action whenever we find it and we\u2019ve launched several ways to help protect people from having to see it in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat includes \u201cHidden Words,\u201d which filters offensive comments and direct messages and is on by default for creator accounts, and \u201cLimits,\u201d which hides comments and DMs from people who don\u2019t follow you or only followed you recently, the statement said.\n\n\u201cWe know no one thing will fix abusive behavior,\u201d Meta said, \u201cbut we\u2019re committed to continuing working closely with the football industry to help keep our apps a safe place for footballers and fans.\u201d\n\nTwitter responded with an automated reply of a poop emoji when the AP reached out for comment.\n\nFor GoBubble founder Platten, platforms are striking a balance between keeping a large user base for revenue purposes while being seen to be tough on racism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be a position where they may move closer to solving the problem,\u201d he said, \u201cbut are never going to go the full hog that we all want them to, in terms of really cracking down and solving it.\u201d\n\nSome teams and athletes are choosing alternative platforms to promote not just themselves but also more ethical behavior online.\n\nThese include Striver, a user-generated content platform backed by Roberto Carlos and Gilberto Silva \u2014 both World Cup winners with Brazil in 2002. And PixStory, a platform with nearly 1 million users which ranks them according to the integrity of their posts and aims to create \u201cclean social\u201d by prioritizing safety in a way big tech companies are not doing.\n\nEngland\u2019s Arsenal club, Italy\u2019s Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s women\u2019s team are collaborating with PixStory, whose founder, Appu Esthose Suresh, says teams and athletes are in a \u201cCatch-22 situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to live in this space because it\u2019s a way to reach out and interact with their fans, but there\u2019s not enough safety,\u201d Suresh told the AP. \u201cThere is an alternative way \u2014 and that\u2019s change the business model.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the biggest change will likely come through legislation. Last month, the European Union clinched an agreement in principle on the Digital Services Act , which will force big tech companies to better protect European users from harmful online content or be punished with billions of dollars in fines for noncompliance. In Britain, the government has proposed the Online Safety Bill, with potential fines amounting to 10% of the platforms\u2019 annual global turnover.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of perpetrators of online racial abuse facing criminal charges has increased. In March, a man who abused England striker Ivan Toney was banned from every soccer stadium in Britain for three years in what police described as a \u201clandmark ruling.\u201d\n\nOnuoha welcomed these developments but he\u2019s still keeping his social media accounts on a private setting.\n\n\u201cThere will be lots of good people who won\u2019t be able to connect with me but it\u2019s a consequence of not having enough trust and faith in enough good people being allowed to enter the account,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the 1% who offset the entire experience.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDouglas reported from Sundsvall, Sweden.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of an Associated Press series examining racism in soccer.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "summary": ["Saka, who has more than 1 million followers on Twitter, remains on social media despite the abuse after England\u2019s Euro 2020 loss and more just a few weeks ago, when a message posted on Twitter showed the Arsenal winger with his face made to look like a monkey, alongside the words: \u201cThis clown has cost us the league.\u201d Minutes before the message, Saka had missed a penalty in an important Premier League game.", "\u201cYes, tech has caused the issue,\u201d GoBubble founder Henry Platten told the AP, \u201cbut tech can actually solve the issue and this is what we are seeing as one of those pieces of the jigsaw.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s AI technology is plugged into players\u2019 accounts and scans for toxic and potentially harmful words, images and other types of messages which can be filtered out using a traffic-light system.", "\u201cWe take action whenever we find it and we\u2019ve launched several ways to help protect people from having to see it in the first place.\u201d\n\nThat includes \u201cHidden Words,\u201d which filters offensive comments and direct messages and is on by default for creator accounts, and \u201cLimits,\u201d which hides comments and DMs from people who don\u2019t follow you or only followed you recently, the statement said.", "Former Premier League striker Mark Bright, who is Black and regularly suffered racial abuse inside stadiums in the 1980s , was exchanging messages with friends on a WhatsApp group when those three Black players for England \u2014 Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho \u2014 missed penalties in a shootout loss to Italy in the 2020 European Championship final.", "England\u2019s Arsenal club, Italy\u2019s Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s women\u2019s team are collaborating with PixStory, whose founder, Appu Esthose Suresh, says teams and athletes are in a \u201cCatch-22 situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to live in this space because it\u2019s a way to reach out and interact with their fans, but there\u2019s not enough safety,\u201d Suresh told the AP."], "tags": ["fifa", "racists", "racist", "racism", "ap_sports"]}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Oregon is invested in Fox Corp. and is investigating its board over bogus election fraud claims", "text": "Oregon is invested in Fox Corp. and is investigating its board over bogus election fraud claims\n\nFILE - Posters of Fox News Channel personalities are displayed at the News Corp. headquarters in New York, April 19, 2017.

George Santos\u2019 lawyer said Monday the indicted New York Republican would risk going to jail to protect the identities of the people who cosigned the $500,000 bond enabling his pretrial release.\n\nThe lawyer, Joseph Murray, urged a judge to deny a request by news outlets to unseal the names of Santos\u2019 bond suretors, or guarantors, suggesting they could \u201csuffer great distress,\u201d including possible job losses and physical harm, if they\u2019re identified publicly.\n\n\u201cMy client would rather surrender to pretrial detainment than subject these suretors to what will inevitably come,\u201d Murray wrote in a letter to U.S. Magistrate Judge Anne Shields.\n\nMurray asked that she give them time to withdraw as cosigners if she decides to unseal their names, which Shields kept off the public court docket at the lawyer\u2019s request.\n\nMurray said he, Santos and Santos\u2019 staff have been receiving threatening and harassing calls and messages, including death threats. The lawyer said he received a call Friday from someone shouting, \u201cWho paid Santos\u2019 bond?\u201d and said he worries Santos\u2019 critics \u201care just waiting to pounce\u201d on the people backing his release.\n\n\u201cWe truly fear for their health, safety and well being,\u201d Murray wrote.\n\nSantos pleaded not guilty on May 10 to a 13-count indictment charging that he duped donors, stole from his campaign, lied to Congress about being a millionaire and cheated to collect unemployment benefits he didn\u2019t deserve. He is due back in court on June 30.\n\nThe 34-year-old, who represents parts of Queens and Long Island, has defied calls to resign and has said he won\u2019t drop his bid for a second term.\n\nProsecutors have not taken a position on the unsealing request.\n\nIn a letter last week, a lawyer for news outlets urged the judge to the release the names of Santos\u2019 bond suretors, citing a \u201ccompelling public interest in maintaining the greatest transparency possible in these proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times first wrote to Shields on May 23 asking to unseal the names. Other news outlets, including The Associated Press, joined the fight a few days later.\n\nSeparately, the House Ethics Committee wrote to Santos on May 16 asking him to identify the people who cosigned his bond.\n\nMurray said Santos originally lined up three financially responsible cosigners as suretors, but one backed out and the other two didn\u2019t show up to his arraignment.\n\nThat forced them to make \u201cother confidential arrangements\u201d to ensure Santos\u2019 release, Murray said.\n\nSantos\u2019 bond is unsecured. That means his cosigners didn\u2019t have put up any money up front, but could be forced to pay the full amount if he doesn\u2019t comply with his release conditions or fails to show up for court.\n\n__\n\nFollow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/ .", "summary": ["Lawyer says Rep.

(AP Photo/Ethan Swope, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Two insurance industry giants have pulled back from California\u2019s home insurance marketplace, saying that increasing wildfire risk and soaring construction costs have prompted them to stop writing new policies in the nation\u2019s most populous state.\n\nState Farm announced last week it would stop accepting applications for all business and personal lines of property and casualty insurance, citing inflation, a challenging reinsurance market and \u201crapidly growing catastrophe exposure.\u201d The decision did not impact personal auto insurance.\n\n\u201cWe take seriously our responsibility to manage risk,\u201d State Farm said. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to take these actions now to improve the company\u2019s financial strength.\u201d\n\nAllstate, another insurance powerhouse, announced in November it would pause new homeowners, condo and commercial insurance policies in California to protect current customers.\n\n\u201cThe cost to insure new home customers in California is far higher than the price they would pay for policies due to wildfires, higher costs for repairing homes and higher reinsurance premiums,\u201d Allstate said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s unsettled market aligns with trends across the country in which companies are boosting rates, limiting coverage or pulling out completely from regions susceptible to wildfires and other natural disasters in the era of climate change. Florida and Louisiana have struggled to keep healthy insurance markets following extensive damage from hurricanes. Premiums are rising in Colorado amid wildfire threats, and an Oregon effort to map wildfire risk was rejected last year because of fears it would cause premiums to skyrocket.\n\nScientists say climate change has made the West warmer and drier over the last three decades and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive. In recent years, California has experienced the largest and most destructive fires in state history.\n\nSome California homeowners already are going without coverage, and a shortage of new policies could make it more difficult to buy a home. A state-run pool that serves as the insurer of last resort for many could face pressure as enrollments surge.\n\nThe state pool \u2014 the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan \u2014 provides basic fire insurance coverage for properties in high-risk areas when traditional insurance companies will not. Enrollments have jumped in recent years to 272,846 homes in 2022.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t have a stable insurance market,\u201d said state Sen. Bill Dodd, a Democrat from Napa, whose Northern California district has been charred by wildfires. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a lot of people in my district and frankly other districts are ... going naked \u2014 they have no insurance.\u201d\n\nAccording to data compiled by the industry-supported Insurance Information Institute, California has more than 1.2 million homes at risk for extreme wildfire, far more than any other state.\n\n\u201cThe number of acres burned in California has grown steadily in recent years, as more people are moving into fire-prone areas of the state,\u201d the institute said in a statement on the company departures from California. \u201cMore homes in harm\u2019s way \u2014 combined with rising costs of repairing or replacing houses either damaged or lost to fire \u2014 leads to increased insured losses.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, which has been hit by devastating wildfires, insurance premiums have been rising significantly, and some smaller insurance companies have been pulling back from covering properties. A study commissioned by state lawmakers found that 76% of carriers decreased their exposures in Colorado in 2022, leaving the five largest insurance companies to dominate the market.\n\nFlorida has struggled to keep the insurance market healthy since 1992, when Hurricane Andrew flattened Homestead, wiped out some insurance carriers and left many remaining companies fearful to write or renew policies in Florida. Risks for carriers also have been growing as climate change increases the strength of hurricanes and intensity of rainstorms.\n\nLouisiana is in the midst of an insurance crisis, exacerbated by hurricanes Delta, Laura, Zeta and Ida in 2020 and 2021. As claims piled up, companies that wrote homeowners policies in the state went insolvent or left, canceling or refusing to renew existing policies.\n\nIn California, the loss of large insurers could create more pressure to loosen consumer-minded policies that have held down rates in the state for years. Voters approved Proposition 103 in 1988, which allows the state insurance commissioner to reject proposed rate increases and order refunds. It has been credited with saving consumers billions of dollars, but the industry says it places constraints on accurate underwriting and pricing risk.\n\nLast year, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara advanced regulations requiring insurers to give discounts to customers if they followed new standards like building fire-resistance roofs and creating defensible space around their homes.\n\nBefore their announcements, State Farm and Allstate both had been seeking significant rate increases.\n\nConsumer Watchdog, a nonpartisan advocacy group, said State Farm\u2019s decision was unlawful.\n\n\u201cInsurance companies can\u2019t just stop selling insurance to consumers in order to make more money for themselves,\u201d Harvey Rosenfield, the author of Proposition 103 and the founder of the group, said in a statement. \u201cThey have to open their books and get the (state) insurance commissioner\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\nLara\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond to an email request for comment.\n\nA state website lists more than 100 companies selling residential insurance, though some offer only limited lines of coverage, such as earthquake or renter insurance.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Coleen Slevin in Denver contributed.", "summary": ["\u201cMore homes in harm\u2019s way \u2014 combined with rising costs of repairing or replacing houses either damaged or lost to fire \u2014 leads to increased insured losses.\u201d\n\nIn Colorado, which has been hit by devastating wildfires, insurance premiums have been rising significantly, and some smaller insurance companies have been pulling back from covering properties.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is a lot of people in my district and frankly other districts are ... going naked \u2014 they have no insurance.\u201d\n\nAccording to data compiled by the industry-supported Insurance Information Institute, California has more than 1.2 million homes at risk for extreme wildfire, far more than any other state.", "(AP Photo/Ethan Swope, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Two insurance industry giants have pulled back from California\u2019s home insurance marketplace, saying that increasing wildfire risk and soaring construction costs have prompted them to stop writing new policies in the nation\u2019s most populous state.", "California\u2019s unsettled market aligns with trends across the country in which companies are boosting rates, limiting coverage or pulling out completely from regions susceptible to wildfires and other natural disasters in the era of climate change.", "State Farm announced last week it would stop accepting applications for all business and personal lines of property and casualty insurance, citing inflation, a challenging reinsurance market and \u201crapidly growing catastrophe exposure.\u201d The decision did not impact personal auto insurance."], "tags": ["wildfires", "wildfire", "rainstorms", "hurricanes", "hurricane"]}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Virginia plane crash investigators ask when pilot became unresponsive and why aircraft flew its path", "text": "Virginia plane crash investigators ask when pilot became unresponsive and why aircraft flew its path\n\nInvestigators in Virginia say a plane that crashed on Sunday after becoming unresponsive is \"no longer distinguishable as an aircraft.\" They also say the plane was not required to have flight recorders, but that it is possible to find information about the flight.

(June 6)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The pilot of a business jet that flew over Washington and crashed in a remote part of Virginia appeared to be slumped over and unresponsive, three U.S. officials said Monday, recounting observations by fighter pilots who intercepted the wayward flight.\n\nThe revelations came as federal investigators trudged through rugged terrain to reach the site where the plane slammed into a mountain Sunday, killing four people. The officials who said that the fighter pilots saw the civilian pilot slumped over had been briefed on the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the military operation.\n\nThe plane\u2019s owner told news outlets that his daughter and 2-year-old granddaughter were aboard.\n\nThe New York-bound plane took an erratic flight path \u2014 inexplicably, turning around over Long Island to fly directly over the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 which prompted the military to scramble fighter jets. This caused a sonic boom heard in Washington, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nRemote terrain around the crash site posed major challenges to the investigation. It took investigators several hours to hike into the rural area near the community of Montebello, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southwest of Charlottesville, said NTSB spokesperson Eric Weiss. They expect to be on the scene for at least three to four days.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing Monday morning, NTSB investigator Adam Gerhardt said the wreckage is \u201chighly fragmented\u201d and investigators will examine the most delicate evidence at the site, after which the wreckage will be moved, perhaps by helicopter, to Delaware, where it can be further examined. The plane is not required to have a flight recorder but it is possible that there are other avionics equipment that will have data that they can examine, Gerhardt said.\n\nThe Virginia State Police issued a statement saying that because of the severity of the crash, human remains will be transported to the state medical examiner\u2019s office for autopsy and identification. The Federal Aviation Administration said that the victims included the pilot and three passengers but didn\u2019t release their names. There were no survivors.\n\nInvestigators will look at when the pilot became unresponsive and why aircraft flew the path that it did, Gerhardt said. They will consider several factors that are routinely examined in such probes including the plane, its engines, weather conditions, pilot qualifications and maintenance records, he said. A preliminary report will be released in 10 days.\n\nAccording to a timetable released late Monday by NTSB spokesperson Jennifer Gabris, the plane took off from Elizabethton Municipal Airport in Tennessee at 1:13 p.m. Sunday, headed for MacArthur Airport in Long Island, N.Y. Air Traffic Control lost communication with the airplane during its ascent.\n\nPreliminary information indicates the last ATC communication attempt with the airplane was at approximately 1:28 p.m., when the plane was at 31,000 feet (9,449 meters). The plane climbed to 34,000 feet (10,363 kilometers), where it remained for the rest of the flight until 3:23 p.m. when it began to descend and crashed about nine minutes later. The plane was flying at 34,000 feet (10,363 kilometers), when it flew over MacArthur Airport at 2:33 p.m., the NTSB said.\n\nThe White House expressed its \u201cdeepest condolences\u201d on Monday to the family of those on board the plane.\n\n\u201cWe need to keep them front and center,\u201d National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said.\n\nKirby deferred questions about a follow-up report on the security response over Washington airspace to the Pentagon and U.S. Secret Service. But he said, \u201cWhat I saw was just a classic, textbook response.\u201d\n\nThe White House was continuously informed as the military jets tried to contact the pilot of the civilian plane and monitored the small aircraft\u2019s path from Washington airspace to rural Virginia, Kirby said.\n\nAir Traffic Control audio from the half-hour before the plane crashed captures voices that identify themselves as military pilots trying to communicate with the pilot of the private plane, according to recordings on LiveATC.net .\n\n\u201cIf you hear this transmission, contact us,\u201d said one pilot who identifies herself as being with the Air National Guard.\n\nSeveral minutes later, a military pilot says: \u201cYou have been intercepted. Contact me.\u201d\n\nThe plane flew directly over the nation\u2019s capital. According to the Pentagon, six F-16 fighter jets were immediately deployed to intercept the plane. Two aircraft from the 113th Fighter Wing, out of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, were the first to reach the Cessna Citation to begin attempts to contact the pilot. Two F-16 aircraft out of New Jersey and two from South Carolina also responded.\n\nFlight tracking sites showed the plane suffered a rapid spiraling descent, dropping at one point at a rate of more than 30,000 feet (9,144 meters) per minute before crashing in the St. Mary\u2019s Wilderness.\n\nIn Fairfax, Virginia, Travis Thornton was settled on a couch next to his wife, Hannah, and had just begun recording himself playing guitar and harmonica when they were startled by a loud rumble and rattling that can be heard on the video . The couple jumped up to investigate. Thornton tweeted that they checked in with their kids upstairs and then he went outside to check the house and talk to neighbors.\n\nThe plane that crashed was registered to Encore Motors of Melbourne Inc, which is based in Florida. John Rumpel, a pilot who runs the company said his family was returning to their home in East Hampton, on Long Island, after visiting his house in North Carolina.\n\nRumpel told the New York Times he didn\u2019t have much information from authorities but suggested the plane could have lost pressurization.\n\n\u201cIt descended at 20,000 feet a minute, and nobody could survive a crash from that speed,\u201d Rumpel told the newspaper.\n\nIn interviews with the Times and Newsday, Rumpel identified his daughter, Adina Azarian, and 2-year-old granddaughter Aria, as two of the victims.\n\nAzarian, 49, was well-known in real estate circles both in New York City and Long Island, described by friends and relatives as a fiercely competitive entrepreneur who started her own brokerage and was raising her daughter as a single parent.\n\n\u201cBeing a mom was everything to her,\u201d said Tara Brivic-Looper, a close friend who grew up with Azarian on the Upper East Side. \u201cThat they were together (at the end) is fitting.\u201d\n\nFriends say Azarian moved to East Hampton fulltime to raise Aria, with the help of a nanny. But she made frequent trips back home, bringing both Aria and the nanny to meet her tight-knit extended family on multiple occasions in recent months.\n\n\u201cShe seemed so happy out there,\u201d her cousin, Andrew Azarian, recalled. \u201cBoth of their lives hadn\u2019t even started.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could this happen?\u201d he continued. \u201cNo one can explain it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBrumfield reported from Silver Spring, Maryland.

As veterans and world dignitaries commemorate the 79th anniversary of the operation , here\u2019s a look at some details about what happened:\n\nWHO TOOK PART\n\nNearly 160,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. Of those, 73,000 were from the United States, 83,000 from Britain and Canada. Forces from several other countries were also involved, including French troops fighting with Gen. Charles de Gaulle against the Nazi occupation.\n\nThey faced around 50,000 German forces.\n\nMore than 2 million Allied soldiers, sailors, pilots, medics and other people from a dozen countries were involved in the overall Operation Overlord, the battle to wrest western France from Nazi control that started on D-Day.\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\nThe sea landings started at 6:30 a.m. local time, just after dawn, targeting five code-named beaches, one after the other: Omaha, Utah, Gold, Sword, Juno.\n\nThe operation also included actions inland, including overnight parachute landings on strategic German sites and U.S. Army Rangers scaling cliffs to take out German gun positions.\n\nAround 11,000 Allied aircraft, 7,000 ships and boats, and thousands of other vehicles were involved in the invasion.\n\nVICTIMS ON ALL SIDES\n\nA total of 4,414 Allied troops were killed on D-Day itself, including 2,501 Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded.\n\nIn the ensuing Battle of Normandy, 73,000 Allied forces were killed and 153,000 wounded. The battle \u2014 and especially Allied bombings of French villages and cities \u2014 killed around 20,000 French civilians.\n\nThe exact German casualties aren\u2019t known, but historians estimate between 4,000 and 9,000 men were killed, wounded or missing during the D-Day invasion alone.

Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday it will hear a case in which a man tried to trademark a phrase mocking former President Donald Trump as \u201ctoo small.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department is supporting President Joe Biden\u2019s once and possibly future rival in urging the court to deny a trademark for the suggestive phrase \u201cTrump too small\u201d that a California man wants to put on T-shirts.\n\nThe case will be argued in the fall, one of two disputes on the court\u2019s upcoming agenda that involve Trump or one of his businesses. Government officials said the phrase \u201cTrump too small\u201d could still be used, just not trademarked because Trump had not consented to its use. But a federal appeals court said refusing trademark registration violated free speech rights.\n\nThe high court has considered a raft of Trump-related cases in recent years. The justices have dealt with cases about Trump\u2019s claims of fraud in the 2000 election and with his efforts to shield his tax records from Congress and to keep other tax records from prosecutors in New York , among other things.\n\nIf the justices are tired of Trump-related cases, however, they aren\u2019t letting on. Just last month, the high court agreed to hear a different Trump-related lawsuit stemming from disputes over what was the Trump International Hotel in Washington . Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee sued over the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to turn over information about the Trump Organization\u2019s lease of the hotel.\n\nThe latest case is unusual in that it has the Biden administration on Trump\u2019s side. The administration is defending government officials\u2019 decision to reject the trademark request from Steve Elster, who tried to register the \u201cTrump too small\u201d phrase.\n\nThe phrase is a reference to a memorable exchange Trump had during the 2016 presidential campaign with Florida senator and GOP presidential rival Marco Rubio.\n\nRubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \u201clittle Marco\u201d but that Trump \u2014 who says he is 6-feet-3-inches tall \u2014 has disproportionately small hands. \u201cHave you seen his hands? ... And you know what they say about men with small hands,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust them.\u201d\n\nTrump then brought up the comment at a televised debate on March 3, 2016.\n\n\u201cLook at those hands. Are they small hands? And he referred to my hands \u2014 if they\u2019re small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there\u2019s no problem. I guarantee you,\u201d he said.\n\nFederal law says that a trademark request should be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \u201cidentifying a particular living individual\u201d unless the person has given \u201cwritten consent.\u201d But Elster says refusing to register a political slogan criticizing Trump without Trump\u2019s consent violates the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech clause. Federal law, Elster\u2019s lawyers say, \u201cmakes it virtually impossible to register a mark that expresses an opinion about a public figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to defending the right to convey core political messages on trademarks,\u201d Elster\u2019s lawyer Jon Taylor wrote in an email. \u201cThe government\u2019s attempt to burden political speech \u2014 by granting public figures a monopoly over speech about them in the marketplace \u2014 is indefensible.\u201d", "summary": ["Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday it will hear a case in which a man tried to trademark a phrase mocking former President Donald Trump as \u201ctoo small.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department is supporting President Joe Biden\u2019s once and possibly future rival in urging the court to deny a trademark for the suggestive phrase \u201cTrump too small\u201d that a California man wants to put on T-shirts.", "Federal law says that a trademark request should be refused if it involves a name, portrait or signature \u201cidentifying a particular living individual\u201d unless the person has given \u201cwritten consent.\u201d But Elster says refusing to register a political slogan criticizing Trump without Trump\u2019s consent violates the First Amendment\u2019s Free Speech clause.", "Federal law, Elster\u2019s lawyers say, \u201cmakes it virtually impossible to register a mark that expresses an opinion about a public figure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look forward to defending the right to convey core political messages on trademarks,\u201d Elster\u2019s lawyer Jon Taylor wrote in an email.", "Rubio began the verbal jousting when he told supporters at a rally that Trump was always calling him \u201clittle Marco\u201d but that Trump \u2014 who says he is 6-feet-3-inches tall \u2014 has disproportionately small hands.", "The justices have dealt with cases about Trump\u2019s claims of fraud in the 2000 election and with his efforts to shield his tax records from Congress and to keep other tax records from prosecutors in New York , among other things."], "tags": ["trump", "president", "2020", "presidential", "lawyer"]}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "Tax refund: Where to invest your tax return", "text": "Smart Investor asked five financial experts how they would invest their 2023 tax return.\n\nSplit it up and have some fun\n\nJessica Brady, founder of The Greenhouse financial literacy program\n\nJessica Brady.
