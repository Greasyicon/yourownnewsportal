McFarland lived on a small piece of land on a Native American reservation in Palm Springs he described as a \u201clittle world of its own,\u201d surrounded by the parts of the city that were tourist magnets and depicted in movies.\n\nThe retiree, who now lives in Mississippi, recently recalled seeing houses of the diverse, tight-knit community being torn and burned down in the square-mile area known as Section 14.\n\n\u201cWe thought they were just cleaning up some of the old houses,\u201d he said.\n\nBut eventually his family was told to vacate their home, and McFarland, his mother and his younger brother hopped around from house to house before leaving the area altogether and moving to Cabazon, a small town about 15 miles (24 kilometers) west of Palm Springs.\n\nDecades later, Palm Springs\u2019 city council is reckoning with those actions, voting in 2021 to issue a formal apology to former residents for the city\u2019s role in displacing them in the 1960s from the neighborhood that many Black and Mexican American families called home. But the former residents say that is not enough.\n\nThose former residents now say the city owes them more than $2.3 billion for the harm caused by their displacement. That would be nearly $1.2 million per family. The dollar amount was disclosed Sunday at a meeting attended by experts such as Cheryl Grills, a member of the state\u2019s reparations task force studying redress proposals for African Americans.\n\nThe effort in Palm Springs is part of a growing push by Black families to seek compensation and other forms of restitution from local and state governments for harms they\u2019ve suffered due to generations of discriminatory policies that continued long after slavery ended.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s statewide reparations task force is evaluating how the state can atone for policies like eminent domain that allowed governments to seize property from Black homeowners and redlining that restricted what neighborhoods Black families could live in. Last year, Los Angeles County officials voted to complete the return of land in Manhattan Beach to a Black family descended from property owners who had it seized by the city through eminent domain in the 1920s. The family decided to sell the property back to the county for $20 million.\n\nPalm Springs officials expect to work with a \u201creparations consultant\u201d to decide whether and how to compensate the families displaced from the area, said Amy Blaisdell, a spokesperson for the city, in an email. The council may take this up for a vote later this month. The city, located about 110 miles (177 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, is home to about 45,000 people today and is largely known as a desert resort community, home to golf courses and ritzy resorts.\n\nThe families are also exploring legal avenues for reparations. Areva Martin, a Los Angeles lawyer representing them, filed a tort claim with the city in November alleging officials hired contractors to bulldoze homes and sent the fire department to burn them. City officials said in response that they would work with former residents and their descendants to try to come up with a solution, Martin said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of the tremendous contributions they made to the city,\u201d she said.\n\nJulianne Malveaux, an economist and dean of the College of Ethnic Studies at California State University, Los Angeles, said the $2.3 billion figure accounts for the displacement of 2,000 families and the trauma caused to them.\n\nLisa Middleton, a city council member and former Palm Springs mayor, said it was important to acknowledge the city\u2019s role in displacing Section 14 residents.\n\n\u201cOur history includes some wonderful moments for which we have every right to be proud,\u201d she said at a meeting. \u201cBut it also includes some moments for which we have every reason to be remorseful, to learn from those mistakes and to make sure that we do not pass those mistakes onto another generation.\u201d\n\nBut the story of displacement at Section 14 is more complicated than some people may realize, said Renee Brown, associate curator and archivist for the Palm Springs Historical Society.\n\nSection 14 is a part of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation. The tribe wanted to open up Section 14 to lease to developers, and the city helped it clear the land over the course of more than a decade, Brown said.\n\n\u201cThe city could never have gone on that land and done anything,\u201d she said, without \u201ctribal permission.\u201d\n\nThe tribe did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe tort claim argues the tragedy was akin to the violence that decimated a vibrant community known as Black Wall Street more than a century ago in Tulsa, Oklahoma, leaving as many as 300 people dead. There were no reported deaths in connection with the displacement of families from Section 14.\n\nThree survivors of the Tulsa massacre are seeking compensation through a lawsuit filed against the city. U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation in 2021 to try to make it easier for survivors and descendants to seek reparations, but the bill never received a hearing.\n\nPalmdale resident Pearl Devers lived in Section 14 with her family until she was 12 years old. She helped spearhead efforts in recent years to create a group to reflect on their time living there and determine next steps.\n\nHer father, a carpenter, helped build their home and many others in Section 14, she said. She recalled how close residents in the neighborhood were, saying her neighbors acted as a \u201csecond set of parents\u201d for her and her brother.\n\nShe recalled smelling and seeing burning homes until one day her mother said their family had to pack their bags and leave.\n\n\u201cWe just felt like we were running from being burned out,\u201d she said.\n\nAlvin Taylor, Devers\u2019 brother, said it\u2019s essential for city officials to listen to displaced residents and descendants before deciding on a course of action for how to best make amends.\n\n\u201cAn apology is not enough,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n___\n\nSophie Austin is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

For years, he delivered mail and all manner of packages: a car bumper, a mini refrigerator, a 70-pound box of horseshoes for a blacksmith. But when an Amazon.com contract with the United States Postal Service required carriers to start delivering packages on Sundays, Groff balked. A Christian, he told his employers that he couldn't deliver packages on the Lord's Day.\n\nNow Groff's dispute with the Postal Service has reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which will consider his case Tuesday. Lower courts have sided with the Postal Service, which says Groff's demand for Sundays off meant extra work for other employees and caused tension. Groff, for his part, argues employers can too easily reject employees' requests for religious accommodations, and if he wins, that could change.\n\n\u201cWe really can\u2019t go back and change what happened to me,\u201d said Groff, who ultimately quit his job over the Sunday shifts. But he says that other people \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between their job and their faith.\u201d\n\nGroff\u2019s case involves Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious discrimination in employment. The law requires employers to accommodate employees\u2019 religious practices unless doing so would be an \u201cundue hardship\u201d for the business.\n\nGroff grew up in Lancaster County, where he attended Mennonite schools and lived in a home across the street from his grandparents' farm. His grandfather's death around the time he graduated from high school was a turning point for him, he said, and helped motivate him to work as a missionary. While he has a college degree in biology, over the years he has gone on eight mission trips lasting anywhere from two months to two years that took him to Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nHe did different jobs in between but in 2012 he found a job at the Postal Service, regularly filling in as a mail carrier when other carriers were off or sick.\n\n\u201cI just really enjoyed the job from the very beginning. You get to be out in the countryside, in the fresh air ... It\u2019s a beautiful place to live and work and I just really enjoyed it and planned to make a career of it unless God called me back to the mission field somewhere,\u201d said Groff of his job as a rural carrier associate.\n\nAs a fill-in mail carrier he ultimately learned 22 different routes, which he would drive in his Honda CR-V, hitting 500 to 800 mailboxes a day. Eventually, he hoped to become a regular mail carrier, with a set route of his own.\n\nSoon after Groff joined the Postal Service, however, it signed a contract with Amazon to deliver packages on Sundays. And about four years into the job Groff was told he'd have to start working his share of Sunday shifts. Groff said no. Sunday, he says, is \u201ca day we come together as Christian believers and we honor the Lord\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so to give that up, to deliver Amazon packages would be to give up everything that we believe in,\u201d Groff said.\n\nTo avoid Sunday work, Groff gave up his seniority at the post office in rural Quarryville, Pennsylvania, where the parking lot includes two spaces labeled \u201cHORSE AND CARRIAGE ONLY.\u201d He transferred to a smaller office in nearby Holtwood, which was not yet doing Sunday deliveries. Eventually, however, Sunday deliveries were required there too.\n\nGroff told his supervisor he'd work extra shifts and holidays to avoid Sundays. The supervisor tried to find other carriers for Groff's Sunday shifts, even though finding substitutes was time consuming and not always possible. Groff's absences, meanwhile, created a tense environment, led to resentment toward management and contributed to morale problems, officials said. It also meant other carriers had to work more Sundays or sometimes deliver more Sunday mail than they otherwise would. One carrier transferred and another resigned in part because of the situation, Groff's supervisor said.\n\nEventually, however, Groff missed enough Sundays that he was disciplined. He resigned in 2019 rather than wait to be fired, he said, and then filed a religious discrimination lawsuit.\n\nGroff says that under a 1977 Supreme Court case, Trans World Airlines v. Hardison, employers don't have to show much to prove an undue hardship and can deny religious accommodations to employees when they impose \u201cmore than a de minimis cost\u201d on the business. The case was 7-2 in favor of TWA with both liberals and conservatives in the majority.\n\nBut Groff's lawyer Hiram Sasser of the First Liberty Institute says the Hardison case \u201csort of stacked the deck against employees and the common folk.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve got to climb Mount Kilimanjaro to try to win one of their cases, and, I mean, that's not right,\u201d he said.\n\nGroff wants the Supreme Court to say that employers must show \u201csignificant difficulty or expense\u201d if they want to reject a religious accommodation.\n\nBiden administration lawyers representing the Postal Service say Hardison should be clarified to make clear it gives substantial protection for religious observance. But the administration also says that when accommodating the religious practices of one employee negatively impacts other employees, that can be an undue hardship on a business.\n\nGroff would seem to have the upper hand. Three current justices \u2014 Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch \u2014 have said the court should reconsider Hardison. And in recent years the court's conservative majority has been particularly sympathetic to the concerns of religious plaintiffs.\n\nLast year, for example, the court sided with another one of First Liberty's clients, a football coach at a public high school who wanted to be able to kneel and pray on the field after games.\n\nGroff, for his part, has found other work since leaving the Postal Service. These days, he's essentially the postmaster for a retirement community with several thousand residents. He oversees a staff of volunteer residents that sorts mail and puts it in mailboxes every day except Sunday.\n\nThere are no Sunday deliveries to Groff's home either. He says he went in and disabled them on Amazon.\n\n\u201cI can wait for that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if I need it that bad, I\u2019ll go to the store and get it.\u201d", "tags": ["tuesday", "mennonite", "sunday"]}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "Ex-Cardinal McCarrick charged in Wisconsin with sex abuse", "text": "The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church\u2019s clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago\n\nMADISON, Wis. -- The defrocked Roman Catholic cardinal who became the face of the church's clergy sex abuse crisis has been charged in Wisconsin with sexually assaulting an 18-year-old man more than 45 years ago, court records show.\n\nA criminal complaint filed Friday alleges that Theodore McCarrick, who was removed from the priesthood in 2019 after a Vatican investigation found he had sexually molested adults and children, fondled a man in 1977 while staying at a cabin on Geneva Lake in southeastern Wisconsin.\n\nThe alleged victim, who is not named, told investigators that McCarrick had repeatedly sexually assaulted him since he was 11 and even brought him to parties where other adult men sexually assaulted him, according to the complaint.\n\nMcCarrick became the highest-ranking Roman Catholic official in the U.S. to face criminal charges for sexual abuse when he was accused in 2021 of sexually assaulting a teenage boy in Massachusetts at a wedding reception in 1974. His attorneys asked the judge in that case earlier this year to dismiss the charges, saying that McCarrick, now 92 and suffering from dementia, is not competent to stand trial.\n\nThe once-powerful priest was ordained in 1958 and became archbishop in Newark, New Jersey, in 1986 and then archbishop of Washington, D.C., in 2000. He rose to power despite church officials' knowledge of accusations against him. A two-year Vatican investigation into McCarrick's tenure found credible reports of his problematic behavior dating back to 1999, including an inquiry confirming that McCarrick had slept with seminarians.\n\nThe church has confirmed it made financial settlements with adults who accused McCarrick of sexual misconduct. McCarrick retired in 2006 but continued to be active in political circles until he was defrocked by Pope Francis in 2019.\n\nWisconsin prosecutors learned of the alleged 1977 assault through a program dedicated to prosecuting instances of abuse by faith leaders, according to a news release. Officials were able to charge McCarrick because the statute of limitations does not apply to people who are not residents of the state. A similar law allowed Massachusetts prosecutors to bring their case against McCarrick more than 40 years later.\n\nMcCarrick's attorney in Massachusetts, William Fick, did not immediately return a phone call or email sent Monday.

Officials said there were no known threats.\n\nAt 6 a.m., race director Dave McGillivray sent out a group of about 20 from the Massachusetts National Guard that hikes the course on the state holiday of Patriots' Day commemorating the start of the Revolutionary War.\n\nCapt. Kanwar Singh, 33, of Malden, Massachusetts, said the race reminds him of Boston's resilience.\n\n\u201cTen years ago, the city came to a halt.

I tillegg har KSK frem til n\u00e5 f\u00e5tt operere ganske frittst\u00e5ende fra resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Da utvikler det seg en holdning om at man er mer spesiell enn andre.

Trump and his allies had claimed Dominion\u2019s voting machines were used to rig the 2020 election, resulting in his loss to Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe voting machine company initially sought $1.6bn from Fox for \u201cintentionally and falsely blaming Dominion for President Trump\u2019s loss\u201d.

Hundreds of people here are dead and they haven\u2019t been buried yet,\u201d said Othman, who is from North Darfur\u2019s capital, el-Fasher.\n\n\u201cBoth the armed forces and the RSF have casualties, but the RSF has suffered more,\u201d the 39-year-old added.\n\nOthman later told Al Jazeera that three people in his neighbourhood had been killed by a bomb, after which the mobile network in his area cut out.\n\nIn South Darfur\u2019s capital, Nyala, local monitors say at least 22 people were killed on the first day of fighting. The violence has since escalated, causing significant civilian casualties. Witnesses told Al Jazeera the army has indiscriminately bombed RSF positions, while the RSF has raided people\u2019s homes, looted markets and engaged in ground battles with army troops.\n\nTwo decades of conflict\n\nThe bloody incidents have evoked painful memories of the violence that began shaking Darfur in 2003 when mostly non-Arab rebel groups rose against the central Sudanese government decrying the historical neglect that their region had suffered and the continuing exploitation of their resources by Khartoum elites.\n\nThe military government at the time decided to outsource fighting this rebellion to Arab tribal militias, a force that ended up committing mass slaughters and numerous human rights abuses in Darfur, according to rights groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting conflict crushed the rebellion, but at a terrible human cost. Between 2003 and 2009, more than 300,000 people died in armed combat \u2013 most in the first two years \u2013 and subsequently from hunger and preventable diseases, which spread rapidly due to the destruction of infrastructure in the war.\n\nIn 2013, many of the Arab tribal militias were repackaged into the RSF by former President Omar al-Bashir, who hoped they would protect him against all threats to his rule. The RSF\u2019s leader, Mohamad Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo, was given his own chain of command, separate from the military.\n\n\u201cThe RSF is the son of the army,\u201d said Othman, with resignation.\n\nOver the years, Hemedti has grown rich and powerful in his own right, by capturing gold mines and leasing out fighters to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nAnd now, the RSF is squaring off in Darfur against the army that was its parent.\n\nNo protection, no monitoring\n\nThe humanitarian situation could deteriorate quickly in Darfur if the international community does not monitor the situation closely. Beyond local monitors, no international mission exists to document abuses. The last one was the joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission, UNAMID, but its mandate expired at the end of 2020.\n\nThe urgent need for monitoring became glaringly obvious after the military and RSF spearheaded an October 2021 coup to upend Sudan\u2019s transition to democracy. In the months that followed, \u201carmed Arab assailants\u201d perpetrated the worst violence against civilians that West Darfur had seen in years, prompting little condemnation or concern from the putschists.\n\n\u201cSince the coup, we have been calling for the UN to establish a new mandate to monitor events in Darfur, but they didn\u2019t,\u201d said Mohamad Osman, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roughly 1.6 million people, having been displaced by previous conflicts, who are living in camps are the most vulnerable, according to Mohamad Al Fattah Youssef, a local journalist and the founder of Darfur 24, an online news source.\n\n\u201cThree people were killed in an IDP camp by a bomb that fell in the south of [Nyala],\u201d he told Al Jazeera, as the sounds of clashes echoed in the background. \u201cThe displaced are really vulnerable right now because all the humanitarian services have been cut off.\u201d\n\nHumanitarian workers have been killed in the crossfire, too. On April 16, three staff from the World Food Programme (WFP) were shot dead in North Darfur\u2019s capital el-Fasher, while two others were badly injured. The killings prompted WFP to suspend operations in the country.\n\nResidents and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that homes and warehouses belonging to UN aid organisations such as WFP and the UN refugee agency have also been looted by RSF fighters, raising concerns that Hemedti does not have strong control over his troops.\n\nRights groups also fear that the battle in Darfur may prompt Arab tribes with close ties to the RSF to settle scores against non-Arab communities. While clashes in Darfur historically take on an ethnic character, the root causes of conflict have long been tied to land disputes, lack of justice and resources.\n\nWorse to come?\n\nWhile this current bout of fighting in Darfur has been limited between the RSF and the army, there are questions about what the non-Arab Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) \u2013 a rebel movement with historic links to Hassan al-Turabi, a former al-Bashir ally and the pioneer of modern political Islam in Sudan \u2013 and the Sudanese Liberation Army of Minnie Minnawi (SLA-MM) will do.\n\nIn the 2000s, both groups fought against the RSF and the army in Darfur, before eventually losing all their territory and being forced to retreat into Libya, where they fought as mercenaries for competing factions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2020, the Juba Peace Agreement, which Hemedti oversaw, brought both groups back to Sudan. On paper, the agreement promised to solve root causes of conflict such as land claims and equitable resource distribution. But in reality, some observers have said (PDF), the RSF and the army co-opted JEM and SLA-MM to build a stronger front against civilian pro-democracy players.\n\nThe two rebel groups, who had little leverage since they had few supporters in Sudan, were promised a fair share of the corrupt economy as integrated members of the security forces.\n\nMore than a year later, both JEM and SLA-MM backed the 2021 military coup that upended Sudan\u2019s aspirations for democracy. Now, they are in a position to tip the balance of power between the army and the RSF.\n\n\u201cI think [both groups] are looking to see who is more powerful before they take sides,\u201d said Anette Hoffman, a Sudan expert with Clingendael Institute, an independent think tank in the Hague.\n\nThe bigger threat to Hemedti, however, is his nemesis Musa Hilal. A member of the same Rizeigat tribe as Hemedti, Hilal was the leader of the Arab tribal militias that spearheaded killings in Darfur in the 2000s.\n\nWhen the RSF was formed in 2013, he was sidelined in favour of Hemedti, whom Khartoum perceived to be a more obedient and transactional client.\n\nIn 2017, Hemedti arrested Hilal after the latter reportedly refused to surrender his militia\u2019s weapons to the government. Hemedti then signed off on releasing Hilal from prison in March 2021.\n\nHoffman noted that Hilal has long had fighters in Libya, where they have fought as mercenaries and accrued weapons. She added that Hilal is generally seen as a more credible figure within the Rizeigat tribe due to his status as a sheikh in Sudan\u2019s Native Administration Councils, the local tribal authorities that represent their communities and mediate to end local conflicts.\n\nEven before the war, there were reports that the army was recruiting from Hilal\u2019s supporters to undercut Hemedti from within.\n\n\u201cHilal has always been waiting for a moment to get revenge [against Hemedti] and I would be really surprised if he remains on the sidelines, especially if the RSF fully retreat to Darfur,\u201d said Hoffman.\n\nOsman, of HRW, agreed and said the outsourcing of the conflict to tribal militias in Darfur and elsewhere should be expected, given the history of Sudan.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that every minute of fighting that continues is bad for civilians. These are forces that never showed any respect for the laws of war or international law,\u201d he said.", "tags": []}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Justice sought after US teen Ralph Yarl shot for ringing doorbell", "text": "Lawyers for Yarl are demanding to know why gunman was initially released after Thursday\u2019s shooting in Missouri.\n\nThe white man accused of shooting a Black 16-year-old when the teen rang the doorbell of his house has surrendered to police in Clay County, Missouri, a day after charges were issued in the case that provoked nationwide outrage in the United States.\n\nAndrew Lester, 84, was briefly held at the county detention center on Tuesday following his surrender, according to a statement from the local sheriff\u2019s office.

It has had more than a dozen coups and coup attempts since it gained independence in 1958.\n\nBut it is not. All its coups \u2013 attempted, realised and failed \u2013 have had a devastating effect on the country, unleashing repression onto its struggling population and destabilising the state.\n\nDespite this tragic history, those who have never won on the battlefield are still eager to attack civilians and civilian institutions and violently suppress political parties as if they were the enemies of the state, all to preserve their power.\n\nAmong the few serious studies of the Arab armies is a paper by the Arab Center for Research and Policy Studies that notes a pattern of behaviour common to most coups, including the latest in Sudan.\n\nIt argues that once they take hold of political power, coup leaders do not give it up voluntarily. In other words, they do not seize power for others to rule over them. And once they depose the head of state, coup leaders begin to suspect one another and tend to turn on each other.\n\nMoreover, military leaders-cum-political leaders tend to militarise politics and politicise the military to the detriment of state institutions and the people. Unable or incapable of providing socioeconomic solutions to their nations\u2019 problems, they resort to religious populism, sectarianism or the only language they master \u2013 force. They perpetuate instability in the name of stability and fear in the name of security.\n\nSo it is no surprise that Sudan\u2019s coup leaders, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the army chief, and General Mohamad Hamdan \u201cHemedti\u201d Dagalo, the head of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have pursued the same deceitful ways and means to monopolise power after the 2019 ouster of President Omar al-Bashir.\n\nIt was no shock that the mischievous generals squeezed out the civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, in 2022, about 14 months after reaching an accommodation with the Forces for Freedom and Change, which led the civilian movement challenging al-Bashir\u2019s regime.\n\nWhen national and international pressure mounted, they struck a new deal, a transitional Framework Agreement, through which they sought to preserve their power.\n\nAs their influence grew, so did their suspicion of one another. When attempts at power sharing failed, it was only a matter of time before their distrust and discord escalated into an open, bloody confrontation.\n\nWith the battles intensifying in the streets of Khartoum and other major cities and the chances for reconciliation dissipating with each passing day, it is hard to say when the fighting may end or who is more likely to come out on top.\n\nWhat is clear thus far is that the less powerful but more mobile and battle-tested RSF has pursued asymmetrical strategies, deploying rapidly to sensitive power centres to achieve quick wins against the less mobile military. It is also trying to capture or kill al-Burhan and thus deliver a decisive psychological blow to the armed forces.\n\nIf the RSF does not achieve a quick victory and the fighting persists unabated, the bigger, more powerful national army, which has the advantage of more sophisticated weapons like fighter jets, could eventually prevail, albeit at a terrible cost to Sudan and the Sudanese people.\n\nTo be sure, al-Burhan and Hemedti, who were powerful enablers of al-Bashir\u2019s dictatorship before turning on him, have had a long, bloody history from Darfur to Yemen. They have conspired against the 2019 popular uprising against al-Bashir and undermined the political transformation towards civilian rule. And today, both have de facto forfeited any right to lead the country, having cynically dragged it down the path of bloodshed and destruction.\n\nHaving said that, the two strongmen have very different pedigrees and head two very different military forces. While al-Burhan is a professional soldier who climbed the ranks of an army with clear structures and operating systems, Hemedti was a rogue camel smuggler turned hired gun turned leader of a vicious militia that conducts illicit trade and functions according to his whims and fancies.\n\nAl-Burhan\u2019s transgressions are outrageous, considering his position as army chief. But that is precisely why Sudan deserves a national army whose leaders are professional, legitimate and accountable to its government.\n\nEvery state requires or deserves a truly national army, but no state needs a shadowy militia that functions above the law. It is a recipe for perpetual disaster.\n\nThat is not to say that the Sudanese people must now take sides as the strongmen fight it out at the expense of the country\u2019s security and stability. Regardless of its outcome, once this reckless, bloody fight is over, hopefully soon, Sudan must overhaul its military and rid itself of all militias.\n\nAs they are pushed to choose the lesser of two evils, the Sudanese should opt for a third choice: a civilian-led, democratically elected government that oversees the return of the army to its barracks.", "tags": []}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "When is Eid al-Fitr 2023?", "text": "The three-day festival celebrates the completion of Ramadan by Muslims across the world.\n\nAs the fasting month of Ramadan comes to an end, Muslims from around the world will be preparing for Eid al-Fitr, the \u201cfestival of breaking the fast\u201d.\n\nDepending on the sighting of the moon, Eid celebrations will most likely begin on Saturday, April 22, depending on where you are in the world.\n\nLunar months last between 29 and 30 days so Muslims usually have to wait until the night before Eid to verify its date.\n\nCountries that started Ramadan on March 23, will have their local moon sighters scan the horizon after sunset for the crescent moon on Thursday, April 20.\n\nIf the new moon is visible, then the next day will be Eid, if not, Muslims will then fast one more day to complete a 30-day month.\n\nWhen the sighting has been verified, Eid is declared on television, radio stations and at mosques.\n\nAccording to the United Kingdom\u2019s HM Nautical Almanac Office, the birth of the new Moon will be visible at 04:13 GMT on Thursday, April 20, but will only be visible under certain conditions across North America.\n\nHowever, the overwhelming majority of the world should be able to easily see the new Moon with the naked eye the following night, Friday, April 21, meaning the first day of Eid will be Saturday, April 22.\n\nOnly a handful of countries in the southern hemisphere, including parts of South America, Australia and New Zealand, might not see the moon on Friday night unless conditions are ideal or if they use an optical aid. For those countries, Eid will start on Sunday, April 23.\n\nHow do Muslims celebrate Eid?\n\nTraditionally, Eid is celebrated for three days as an official holiday in Muslim-majority countries. However, the number of holiday days varies by country.\n\nMuslims begin Eid day celebrations by partaking in a prayer service that takes place shortly after dawn, followed by a short sermon.\n\nOn their way to the prayer, which is traditionally held in an open area, Muslims recite takbeerat, praising God by saying \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d, meaning \u201cGod is great\u201d.\n\nIt is customary to eat something sweet before the prayer, such as date-filled biscuits known as maamoul.\n\nMuslims usually spend the day visiting relatives and neighbours and accepting sweets as they move around from house to house.\n\nEach country has traditional desserts and sweets that are prepared before Eid or on the morning of the first day.\n\nAcross the Middle East, making date-filled semolina cookies called maamoul has been a tradition during Eid. These can also be filled with nuts and dusted with icing sugar.\n\nSheer khurma or siviyaan is the Eid speciality in households across India and Pakistan. The vermicelli and milk pudding are often decorated with nuts or raisins.\n\nBaklava, a layered pastry, is also prepared for Eid in Turkey and across the region. Layers of thin filo pastry are stuffed with pistachio and other nuts soaked in orange blossom syrup. The traditional sweet can also be made with a variety of different fillings.\n\nIn Nigeria, making amala with ewedu is a celebratory dish served on special occasions like Eid. Ewedu is a traditional plant-based soup served with yam flour or cassava served with a meat stew.\n\nIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, tufahija \u2013 poached stuffed apples in simple syrup, sometimes stuffed with walnuts \u2013 is a traditional dessert which is served on Eid-al-Fitr.\n\nIn Morocco, a savoury pie made with chicken or pigeon, known as bastilla, is often prepared for Eid. The meat is marinated for a day or two, wrapped in thin layers and then baked or deep-fried.\n\nChildren, dressed in new clothes, are offered gifts and money to celebrate the joyous occasion.\n\nIn some countries, families visit graveyards to offer their respects to departed family members.\n\nIt is common for Muslim-majority countries to decorate their cities with lights and hold festivities to commemorate the end of the fasting month.\n\nWhat are common Eid greetings?\n\nThe most popular greeting is \u201cEid Mubarak\u201d (Blessed Eid) or \u201cEid sa\u2019id\u201d (Happy Eid). Eid greetings also vary depending on the country and language.\n\nThe video below shows how people say Eid Mubarak in different languages around the world.", "tags": []}]
