In a separate incident, two British-Israeli women were shot to death near a settlement in the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe spasm of violence in Israel and the West Bank has heightened fears of an even more intense surge, with the rare convergence of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, the Jewish Passover holiday and Easter currently underway.\n\nLeaders of the grassroots protest movement against the judicial overhaul called for the weekly mass protest to continue as planned Saturday, with tens of thousands of people attending for a 14th consecutive week.\n\nThey portrayed the anti-government demonstration as a rally of solidarity with those killed and wounded in Friday\u2019s attacks, as well as with Israelis living near the Lebanese border and the Gaza border affected by recent Palestinian rocket fire. In Tel Aviv, protesters held a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nThe protest organizers argue that the overhaul plans have diminished Israel\u2019s national security by roiling the military and weakening the country in the eyes of its enemies.\n\nUpon announcing the delaying of the proposed changes in Israel\u2019s legal system, Netanyahu appeared to calm some of the tensions that have fueled three tumultuous months of unrest. But his announcement failed to address the underlying issues that have polarized the nation, and he has vowed to revive the plan in the coming weeks if negotiations on a compromise with the political opposition fail.\n\nThe plan would give Netanyahu, who is on trial on corruption charges, and his allies the final say in appointing the nation\u2019s judges. It would also give parliament, which is controlled by his allies, authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit the court\u2019s ability to review laws.\n\nNetanyahu's supporters say the plan is needed to rein in the powers of unelected judges.

Later, the military said Israeli fighter jets attacked Syrian army sites, including a compound of Syria's 4th Division and radar and artillery posts.\n\nThe rocket firings came after days of escalating violence on multiple fronts over tension in Jerusalem and an Israeli police raid on the city\u2019s most sensitive holy site.\n\nIn the second barrage, which was launched early Sunday, two of the rockets crossed the border into Israel, with one being intercepted and the second landing in an open area, the Israeli military said. In the first attack, on Saturday, one rocket landed in a field in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Fragments of another destroyed missile fell into Jordanian territory near the Syrian border, Jordan\u2019s military reported.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties.\n\nA Damascus-based Palestinian group loyal to the Syrian regime claimed responsibility for launching the three missiles Saturday, reported Beirut-based Al-Mayadeen TV.\n\nThe report quoted Al-Quds Brigade, a militia different than the larger Palestinian Islamic Jihad\u2019s armed wing with a similar name, as saying it fired the rockets to retaliate for the police raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nIn Syria, an adviser to President Bashar Assad described the rocket strikes as \u201cpart of the previous, present and continuing response to the brutal enemy.\u201d\n\nIsrael, which has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria, has carried out hundreds of strikes in government-controlled parts of that country in recent years, though it rarely acknowleges them. Before the latest strikes, Syrian officials had attributed 10 attacks to Israel this year, some of which put the Damascus and Aleppo airports temporarly out of service and killed civilians as well as Syrian soldiers and Iranian military advisers.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, Israeli security forces fatally shot a 20-year-old Palestinian in the town of Azzun, Palestinian health officials said, stirring protests in the area. The Israeli military said troops fired at Palestinians hurling stones and explosive devices. The Palestinian Health Ministry identified the Palestinian killed as Ayed Salim.\n\nHis death came at a time of unusually heightened violence in the West Bank. Over 90 Palestinians and have been killed by Israeli fire so far this year, at least half of them affiliated with militant groups, according to a tally by The Associated Press.\n\nPalestinian attacks on Israelis have killed 19 people in that time \u2014 including on Friday two British-Israelis shot to death near a settlement in the Jordan Valley and an Italian tourist killed by a suspected car-ramming in Tel Aviv. All but one were civilians.\n\nThe rocket fire from Syria comes against the backdrop of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions touched off by an Israeli police raid on Jerusalem's most sensitive site, the sacred compound home to the Al-Aqsa mosque. That outraged Palestinians marking the holy fasting month of Ramadan and prompted militants in Lebanon \u2014 as well as Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip \u2014 to fire a heavy barrage of rockets into Israel.\n\nIn retaliation, Israeli warplanes struck sites allegedly linked to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza and southern Lebanon.\n\nLate Saturday, tensions ran high in Jerusalem as a few hundred Palestinian worshippers barricaded themselves in the mosque, which sits on a hilltop in the heart of Jerusalem's Old City sacred to both Muslims and Jews. Israeli police efforts to evict the worshippers locked in the mosque overnight with stockpiled firecrackers and stones spiraled into unrest in the holy site earlier this week.\n\nThe latest escalations prompted Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to extend a closure barring entrance to Israel for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for the duration of the Jewish holiday of Passover, while police beefed up forces in Jerusalem on the eve of sensitive religious celebrations.\n\nIn a separate incident in the northern West Bank city of Nablus late Saturday, a leader of a local independent armed group known as the Lion's Den claimed the group executed an alleged Israeli collaborator who had tipped off the Israeli military to the locations and movements of the group's members. Israeli security forces have targeted and killed several of the group's key members in recent months.\n\nThe accused man's killing could not be immediately confirmed, but videos in Palestinian media showed medics and residents gathered around his bloodied body in the Old City, where the Lion's Den holds sway. \u201cTraitors have neither a country nor a people,\u201d Lion's Den commander Oday Azizi said in a statement.\n\nThe moves come at a time of heightened religious fervor \u2013 with Ramadan coinciding with Passover and Easter celebrations. Jerusalem\u2019s Old City, home to key Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, has been teeming with visitors and religious pilgrims from around the world.\n\nGallant said that a closure imposed last Wednesday, on the eve of Passover, would remain in effect until the holiday ends on Wednesday night. The order prevents Palestinians from entering Israel for work or to pray in Jerusalem this week, though mass prayers were permitted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday. Gallant also ordered the Israeli military to be prepared to assist Israeli police. The army later announced that it was deploying additional troops around Jerusalem and in the West Bank.\n\nOver 2,000 police were expected to be deployed in Jerusalem on Sunday \u2013 when tens of thousands of Jews are expected to gather at the Western Wall for the special Passover priestly blessing. The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray and sits next to the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, where large crowds gather each day for prayers during Ramadan.\n\nJerusalem police chief Doron Turgeman met with his commanders on Saturday for a security assessment. He accused the Hamas militant group, which rules the Gaza Strip, of trying to incite violence ahead of Sunday\u2019s priestly blessing with false claims that Jews planned to storm the mosque.\n\n\u201cWe will allow the freedom of worship and we will allow the arrival of Muslims to pray,\u201d he said, adding that police \u201cwill act with determination and sensitivity\u201d to ensure that all faiths can celebrate safely.\n\nThe current round of violence erupted earlier in the week after Israeli police raided the mosque, firing tear gas and stun grenades to disperse hundreds of Palestinians who had barricaded themselves inside.

In 2017, district officials began requiring the high school's teachers to use the names and pronouns listed in the school's official student database, where changes were permitted with letters from a student's parent and a doctor.\n\nKluge told the school's principal, Bret Daghe, on the first day of classes for the 2017 school year that he had a religious objection to using transgender students' names and pronouns. District officials agreed that Kluge could call students by their last name and would not be responsible for handing out orchestra clothing.\n\nBut at least two transgender students reported that Kluge's refusal to use their first names singled them out in front of peers and was hurtful. Other students, teachers and counselors also told officials that the issue made Kluge's classroom uncomfortable for many.\n\nIn January, the district told teachers that everyone would be required to use the names and pronouns listed for students in the database. In response to Kluge questioning whether the rule would also apply to him, officials told him he could abide by it, resign or be fired.\n\nKluge resigned and then sued the school for religious discrimination.\n\nAn Indiana federal judge ruled that Kluge's refusal to use transgender students' names and pronouns created an undue hardship on the district, which is responsible for educating all of its students.\n\nThe appeals court agreed, writing that district officials tried to accommodate Kluge's religious objection but realized that letting the music teacher use last names \u201cresulted in students feeling disrespected, targeted, and dehumanized, and in disruptions to the learning environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrownsburg has demonstrated as a matter of law that the requested accommodation worked an undue burden on the school\u2019s educational mission by harming transgender students and negatively impacting the learning environment for transgender students, for other students in Kluge\u2019s classes and in the school generally, and for faculty,\u201d the opinion read.\n\nRory Gray, an attorney with the conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, is representing Kluge and said they are considering next steps.\n\n\u201cCongress passed Title VII to prevent employers from forcing workers to abandon their beliefs to keep their jobs,\u201d Gray said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, Mr. Kluge went out of his way to accommodate his students and treat them all with respect.

With help from a nonprofit that advises communities like theirs and helps them secure loans, they bought it for $5.25 million. Since becoming owners in September, everyone\u2019s worked to make improvements.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought, \u2018You know what? ... I\u2019m going to make this place the best that I can,\u2019\u201d said Galvez, 22, who is a co-op board member. \u201cSome people painted their homes, some people remodeled their interiors and exteriors, and some are working on their roofs.\u201d\n\nWith rents rising at mobile home parks nationwide, advocates tout the cooperative model as a way to preserve one of the last affordable housing options for people with low- or fixed-incomes and to give them a greater voice in managing their parks.\n\nSo far these resident-owned communities are proving to be a reliable option. None of the more than 300 in the network of nonprofit ROC USA have defaulted or closed. One decided to sell back to the county housing authority it originally purchased from.\n\n\u201cThey have a 100% track record of success, which tells you that it\u2019s working for the residents,\u201d said George McCarthy, president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, think tank. \u201cResident ownership is an absolute bulwark against the intrusion of institutional capital in the market.\u201d\n\nThe push to promote resident ownership comes as parks have become a favorite target of investment banks, hedge funds and other deep-pocketed investors.\n\nNearly a third of mobile home parks in the U.S. have been bought by such investors since 2015, lured by reliable cash flow and high returns from raising rents at nearly double the general rental market rate, McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trading on the desperation of people living in the parks,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that they can take their homes if they can\u2019t afford to keep paying the increasing rents.\u201d\n\nPark residents often own their home but rarely the land beneath it. So if a landlord raises rent, residents can be evicted or forced to sell their home. If a park is sold to be redeveloped, mobile homes that can\u2019t be moved are demolished.\n\n\u201cHomelessness is really what residents are facing\" if investors aggressively raise rents, said Victoria O\u2019Banion, ROC Northwest\u2019s marketing and acquisitions specialist.\n\nAt Rimrock Court in the central Oregon town of Madras, rent increased from $350 to $495 over five years. When the owner notified residents he planned to sell, they feared further increases \u2014 or worse, that it would be torn down to make way for apartments. So they decided to buy it.\n\n\u201cWe were really worried about being forced out of our homes,\u201d said Shawn King, who lives there with her husband on a fixed income and had experienced homelessness before.\n\nTo pay off the purchase loan, residents now pay $520 a month \u2014 a stretch, but one that comes with reassurance, King said.\n\n\u201cJust to have that peace of mind, to know that our rent is going to be locked in for awhile and not keep going up, and also knowing that our rent monies ... are going back into the property, that is the cool part,\u201d she said.\n\nThe required rent increase to go co-op was even steeper in Evergreen Village Cooperative in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania, \u2014 from $460 a month to $750 to pay off the $12 million loan.\n\nStill, more than two-thirds of residents voted in favor, figuring their rent would stabilize in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe are not for profit. All the money that we get has to go back into the village and pay the mortgages off,\" said Stephen Laclair, board president.\n\nEvergreen Village has earmarked funds for improvement projects for the next decade, and this year plans to enhance the sewer plant and fix electrical issues, he said.\n\nCo-ops can also provide social support to residents. At Liberty Landing Cooperative in Missouri, residents started a food pantry to help neighbors in need.\n\n\u201cIf there's a hardship, we're willing to work with somebody. ... It's emotional when you find out that somebody's lost their job, their child support ... and they don't know what to do,\u201d said Kristi Peterman, the board vice president. \u201cOur president likes to say: \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work for the poorest of us then it\u2019s not going to work for anybody.'\"\n\nDespite the talk of better management and stronger community, most parks aren't co-ops.\n\nThe country\u2019s roughly 43,000 mobile home communities are home to 22 million people, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, a national trade organization. But only about 1,000 are resident-owned, according to Carolyn Carter, deputy director at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nSome resistance comes from residents, many of whom are seniors and people with disabilities who may not want the responsibility of managing their park. Others argue rent control or stricter zoning regulations protecting mobile home parks from redevelopment are more effective.\n\n\u201cZoning is critical. ... That is what we ought to be fighting for everywhere,\u201d said Jan Leonard, who lives in a park in Walla Walla, Washington, and worked with other residents to successfully push the city council to amend zoning codes to add mobile home parks as a land-use type.\n\nOther residents considering buying their parks are running up against the same forces that make them popular with investors \u2014 a red-hot market and competition from private equity firms and other prospective buyers.\n\nSarah Marchant, vice president of Community Loan Fund, ROC USA\u2019s New Hampshire affiliate, recalled Tara Estates, a 380-home park in Rochester. The steep $45 million asking price discouraged residents from organizing.\n\nAnother challenge is that few states provide funding for residents looking to buy their parks. The lack of grants can make it difficult for residents to finance large loans.\n\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon are among states with laws that have been effective in helping residents buy their parks, the National Consumer Law Center said.\n\nA new bill in Oregon would allocate $35 million in grants to help residents purchase their parks. Washington passed a bill last month requiring that landlords offer tenants a chance to compete to purchase their park. It also requires two years' notice if a park will be closed, although that can be reduced if landlords financially compensate residents.\n\nMobile homes are \u201can important and affordable housing option for a lot of folks, especially older people aging in place, and we need to make sure it\u2019s preserved,\" said state Sen. Noel Frame, the Washington bill's prime sponsor.\n\nSome real estate groups and park owners argue the bill places an undue burden on landlords.\n\n\u201cIf you want tenants to organize and make offers to purchase their communities ... they should not wait until there's a clock ticking,\u201d said Robert Cochran, property manager of Contempo Mobile Home Park in Spokane.\n\nHousing advocates say they hope that $225 million in recently approved federal funding may provide some relief for mobile home park residents. Starting this year, the money will be funneled through grants to states, resident-owned parks, nonprofits, and local and tribal governments to preserve mobile home communities and improve infrastructure.\n\nKing cherishes the mobile home that going cooperative at Oregon\u2019s Rimrock Court saved from rent increases and a potential buyout by investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to find affordable housing when you\u2019re low income. To be able to own your own home is so empowering,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 600-square-feet.

I had been at a bar with a small group one freezing winter night in 2012 in Buffalo, New York. One of us, eager to share his recent obsession, declared it was time for the outing's next stage. We went to his barely unpacked new apartment nearby. He pulled the game from a plastic tote, opened it on a wobbly dinette table, and laid out the board, apologizing for the moisture-warped edges. I took a picture (on my HTC Thunderbolt) because, having had a few, I wanted to ensure I'd remember this game with the wooden pieces and weird amount of sheep.\n\nIt was an inauspicious start to the rest of my board gaming life. Growing up in the '80s and '90s, then starting my young adult life in the early 2000s, I'd regarded board games as something you do in situations where you can't do anything else: power outages, cabins in the woods, gatherings with people without known shared interests. They weren't really going to be fun, and you wouldn't necessarily play them, but someone would get to be the winner, and time would pass. Catan changed that\u2014for me and for what are now legions of modern board game enthusiasts.\n\nFrom a German basement to 32 million copies\n\nYou may have seen the news this week that Klaus Teuber, the German designer who created The Settlers of Catan (now just Catan), died on April 1 at age 70. Teuber developed Die Siedler von Catan in the early 1990s, playing with ideas of Icelandic settlements, tinkering in his basement while working full-time at a dental lab. He'd bring up new iterations for his wife and kids to test every weekend, he told The New Yorker. The breakthrough, he said, was using hexagonal tiles instead of squares.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTeuber has created other memorable games, with two pre-Catan titles winning the top board game prize in Germany (and the world), the Spiel des Jahres. But Catan was the right game at the right time. Its 1995 release gave it time to infiltrate European gamers, then American Eurogame enthusiasts, and then, crucially, the still-nascent Internet. BoardGameGeek.com wouldn't show up until 2000, but by then, Catan had done its groundwork. It offered a face-to-face, objects-on-a-table counterpoint to a culture rapidly accepting online chatter and screen-based gaming. A 2009 feature in the Wall Street Journal captures the game just as it had overtaken Silicon Valley (with cameos from StumbleUpon, Zynga, RapLeaf, and other terribly 2009 names).\n\nGuido Teuber, Klaus' son, said that sales spiked in Silicon Valley in 2007 to 2008, just after the game became available on Amazon and in Barnes & Noble. He told the Journal he was initially surprised by the \"techie interest\" but \"then we saw how they need social interaction after sitting all day in front of a monitor.\"\n\nWhat makes Catan (and Eurogames) different\n\nThe simplest way to explain what makes Catan and other \"Eurogames\" different from mainstream US board games is that they are relatively easy to learn yet offer many layers of deeper strategy for those who keep playing. They also typically don't let players be removed from the game before the final score tallying, they have a greater reliance on strategy, resource management, and risk/reward consideration than luck, and they feature less direct conflict between players.\n\nPeruse the list of Spiel des Jahres winners and finalists since Catan's 1995 release, and you'll get the gist of the types of games I'm talking about: Carcassone, Puerto Rico, Ticket to Ride, Dominion, Pandemic, Forbidden Island, 7 Wonders, Terraforming Mars, Azul, Wingspan. It's possible to win these games your first time playing, but experienced players have an edge, softened just a bit by luck. They give you something to think about when it's not your turn, so you're not just waiting, but many such games are not so demanding as to preclude pizza, beer, and side conversations. And they have a time of play printed on the box, typically 90 minutes or less, that is realistic (at least when everyone knows the rules)."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "We\u2019re one step closer to reading an octopus\u2019s mind", "text": "Nine brains, blue blood, instant camouflage: It\u2019s no surprise that octopuses capture our interest and our imaginations. Science-fiction creators, in particular, have been inspired by these tentacled creatures.\n\nAn octopus's remarkable intelligence makes it a unique subject for marine biologists and neuroscientists as well. Research has revealed the brain power of the octopus allows it to unscrew a jar or navigate a maze. But, like many children, the octopus also develops an impish tendency to push the boundaries of behavior. Several aquariums have found octopuses memorizing guard schedules to sneak into nearby tanks to steal fish; meanwhile, marine biologists have discovered that wild octopuses will punch fish\u2026 for no apparent reason.\n\nAccording to Dr. Jennifer Maher, a professor at the University of Lethbridge in Canada, there are a \u201cnumber of [different] types of learning [for octopuses]: cognitive tasks like tool use, memory of complex operations for future use, and observational learning.\u201d\n\nHow does the distinct structure of the octopus\u2019s brain enable all this complex behavior? No one had successfully studied wild or freely moving octopuses\u2019 brain waves until a new study by researchers at the University of Naples Federico II in Italy and the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) in Japan, among others. In their Current Biology paper, the researchers tracked and monitored three captive but freely moving octopuses, analyzing their brain waves for the first time. Using recording electrodes, the researchers found a type of brain wave never before seen, along with brain waves that may be similar to some seen in human brains, possibly providing hints about the evolution of intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCunning cephalopods\n\nOur current understanding of octopus intelligence may seem unbelievable. In 2011, researchers discovered that each arm of the cephalopod has its own \u201cbrain.\u201d Using a transparent maze with food in it, held outside of the tank, the researchers forced the octopus to navigate the maze using only its arm, even though it could see where the food was. The octopus couldn\u2019t rely on chemical cues processed by its brain to find the food, as it typically does in the ocean, forcing the arm\u2019s individual \u201cbrain,\u201d or neuron bundle, to find the food on its own by processing the signals locally. Each octopus arm is thought to have around 10,000 neurons dedicated to sensing its surroundings.\n\nOther research shows that octopuses are the only invertebrates, besides a few insects, to use tools. They will compress shells around their bodies as a type of proto-armor and camouflage against predators.\n\nOctopuses can also mimic human movement by walking bipedally, lifting six of their legs like a skirt, and scooting along the ocean floor. However, that seems to be one of the few similarities between these cephalopods and humans, as evolution has separated us by many millions of years.\n\n\u201cThe enormous difference between octopuses and us stems from over 550 million years of independent evolution,\u201d explained Dr. Michael Kuba, the OIST project leader for the 2023 octopus brainwave study who now works at Naples University. \u201cOur closest common ancestor probably resembled a flatworm.\u201d Yet Kuba and his team are looking at the few similarities to learn more about the evolution of mental abilities.\n\nWiring an octopus\u2019s brain\n\nIt\u2019s no easy task to read an octopus\u2019s brain. For one thing, the animals are nearly impossible to track in the wild. \u201cOctopuses are hard to see, and besides, they are often out of water in tide pools,\u201d Maher added. \u201cOnly some of them habituate to people, and many species are nocturnal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo avoid these complications, many researchers turn to captive octopuses to study their brains. But even this can prove challenging. \u201cSince the octopuses have eight ultra-flexible arms that can reach any part of their body and have a soft body with no skull to anchor the recording equipment, the challenge of this project was to realize a new equipment that was out of reach,\u201d said Dr. Anna Di Cosmo, a professor at the University of Naples and a researcher involved in the 2023 study.\n\nReach matters because the animal often removes or plays with the recording equipment. Kuba, Di Cosmo, and others decided to take a new approach by implanting their recording devices inside the octopus\u2019s brain, far out of reach.\n\nAn octopus lobotomy\n\n\u201cWe developed a new engineering solution, able to record signals underwater, using small and lightweight data loggers, originally utilized to track the brain activity of birds during flight,\u201d Di Cosmo added. These repurposed loggers were carefully placed into the upper head of three captive tropical octopuses, just between their eyes. \u201cThe electrodes were implanted into an area of the octopus\u2019s brain called the vertical lobe and median superior frontal lobe,\u201d Di Cosmo stated, \u201cwhich is the most accessible area and considered important to control learning and memory processes.\u201d\n\nThe octopuses were anesthetized during their surgeries. They spent the next 12 hours recovering, monitored in their tanks, being the first octopuses to be studied in real time. \u201cWe also filmed them with a sensitive camera as they swam, slept, and explored their surroundings,\u201d Kuba added. While the researchers didn\u2019t have the octopuses complete any brain teasing activities during the next 12 hours of study, they did find some interesting brain activity in their test subjects.\n\nWhen the team looked at an octopus\u2019s brain waves for the first time, the results were shocking. As Di Cosmo explained, these signatures were \u201clong-lasting, slow oscillations that have not been described before.\u201d As far as we know, these signatures appear to be unique to the octopuses.\n\nBecause the researchers didn\u2019t test the octopuses while recording them, they couldn\u2019t link these unique brain waves to any specific activity, leaving that question to be answered by a future experiment."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "New photo reveals extent of Centaur V anomaly explosion [Updated]", "text": "10:30 pm ET Update: Several hours after this article was published, Ars obtained a still image of the Centaur V anomaly that occurred on March 29 during testing of the Vulcan rocket's upper stage. The photo shows the anomaly\u2014a fireball of hydrogen igniting\u2014to the left of Blue Origin's rocket engine test stand.\n\nAfter the author posted this photo on Twitter, United Launch Alliance chief executive Tory Bruno offered a more detailed assessment of the anomaly. \"Most of what you\u2019re seeing is insulation and smaller bits from the test rig. One piece of the hydrogen tank\u2019s dome, about a foot square, ended up a few feet away. The test article is still inside the rig and largely intact, which will significantly help with the investigation\", Bruno said via Twitter.\n\nOriginal post: On the evening of March 29, at Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, United Launch Alliance started pressurizing the upper stage of its new Vulcan rocket. But then, suddenly, something went wrong with this Centaur upper stage.\n\nShortly after the incident, to his credit, the chief executive of United Launch Alliance, Tory Bruno, was quick to acknowledge on Twitter that something had happened: \"Keeping you posted: During Qual testing of Centaur V structural article at MSFC, the hardware experienced an anomaly.\"\n\nUnpacking this tweet a little bit, Bruno is saying that during qualification testing\u2014the process of testing rocket engines and stages on the ground to determine their behavior during flight-like conditions\u2014the Centaur stage had a problem. More than a week later, however, there are more questions than answers about the accident.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA mushroom cloud\n\nMultiple sources confirmed to Ars that there was a large explosion on that Wednesday evening, resulting in multiple first responders coming to the scene at NASA's field center where the company has a test stand. No one was injured, but the accident made for dramatic visuals.\n\n\"A column of burning, clear hydrogen shot up into a mushroom cloud that dwarfed the test stand,\" one source said. \"Their test article is definitely more than just 'damaged.'\"\n\nThe anomaly was captured on video cameras operated by Blue Origin, which is restoring a nearby test stand. Located about 100 meters from the United Launch Alliance facility, Blue Origin has invested more than $100 million in NASA's old Test Stand 4670 for acceptance testing of its BE-4 and BE-3U rocket engines.\n\nA Blue Origin source confirmed that a mushroom cloud formed from the anomaly. Afterward, United Launch Alliance asked Blue Origin to delete the explosive video footage from the company's computers, which Blue Origin agreed to do.\n\n(Note: After publication of this article, when asked about the video deletion, Bruno tweeted that this \"didn't happen.\" However, two sources told Ars that after the incident, United Launch Alliance asked Blue Origin to \"secure\" the video for its investigation. Blue Origin did so, but also removed the video from its own internal servers, reserving access only for a few officials at the company).\n\nThe loss of the Centaur upper stage raises questions about ULA's schedule for the debut launch of its much-anticipated heavy-lift Vulcan rocket. For a couple of years, ULA has said it was waiting on Blue Origin to deliver BE-4 engines for the rocket's first stage. The fact that ULA was still doing qualification testing of the Centaur upper stage suggests it was also a pacing item for the new launch vehicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough this Centaur V upper stage is based on a heritage design, the new version nonetheless has significant upgrades. Previously, Bruno said Centaur V would be able to operate for 40 percent longer in flight and has two-and-a-half times more energy than the Centaur upper stage ULA currently flies.\n\nAnother unanswered question concerns exactly what Centaur stage ULA was testing in Alabama. Was it a fully flight-like stage to be used for a future mission? Or was it more of a prototype stage used for development testing, which might be more susceptible to failure? ULA would not comment on this.\n\nVulcan\u2019s debut\n\nPublicly, ULA has set a May 4 target date for the debut launch of the Vulcan rocket. However, last month, even before the Centaur anomaly occurred, Ars reported that this date was already likely to slip into the summer based on the company's internal timelines. The effect of the Centaur anomaly is yet unclear on Vulcan's schedule.\n\n\"We are conducting an investigation and will fly when we believe it is safe to launch,\" ULA spokesperson Jessica Rye told Ars this week. \"We will not know the impact to the launch date until we learn more information from the investigation.\"\n\nULA has asked the primary customer for the Cert-1 mission, Astrobotic, to refrain from shipping its Peregrine lander to the launch site. The lunar lander remains at the company's facilities in Pittsburgh, waiting for a green light from the rocket company.\n\nAfter the accident, Bruno speculated on Twitter that it was \"very unlikely\" to have implications for the Centaur V upper stage that is currently in Florida and planned for use on Vulcan's Cert-1 mission. However, any determination on this will need to wait until ULA completes its accident investigation and consults with the US Space Force, which will ultimately certify the rocket for national security launches.\n\nTime is running out for ULA to complete the development of Vulcan and fly two certification missions this year. This would allow the vehicle to begin flying national security payloads for the Space Force. ULA had hoped to fly its first national security mission in 2023, but now that seems virtually impossible."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Artists astound with AI-generated film stills from a parallel universe", "text": "Since last year, a group of artists have been using an AI image generator called Midjourney to create still photos of films that don't exist. They call the trend \"AI cinema.\" We spoke to one of its practitioners, Julie Wieland, and asked her about her technique, which she calls \"synthography,\" for synthetic photography.\n\nThe origins of \u201cAI cinema\u201d as a still image art form\n\nLast year, image synthesis models like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney began allowing anyone with a text description (called a \"prompt\") to generate a still image in many different styles. The technique has been controversial among some artists, but other artists have embraced the new tools and run with them.\n\nWhile anyone with a prompt can make an AI-generated image, it soon became clear that some people possessed a special talent for finessing these new AI tools to produce better content. As with painting or photography, the human creative spark is still necessary to produce notable results consistently.\n\nNot long after the wonder of generating solo images emerged, some artists began creating multiple AI-generated images with the same theme\u2014and they did it using a wide, film-like aspect ratio. They strung them together to tell a story and posted them on Twitter with the hashtag #aicinema. Due to technological limitations, the images didn't move (yet), but the group of pictures gave the aesthetic impression that they all came from the same film.\n\nThe fun part is that these films don't exist.\n\nThe first tweet we could find that included the #aicinema tag and the familiar four film-style images with a related theme came from Jon Finger on September 28, 2022. Wieland, a graphic designer by day who has been practicing AI cinema for several months now, acknowledges Finger's pioneering role in the art form, along with another artist. \"I probably saw it first from John Meta and Jon Finger,\" she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's worth noting that the AI cinema movement in its current still-image form may be short-lived once text2video models such as Runway's Gen-2 become more capable and widespread. But for now, we'll attempt to capture the zeitgeist from this brief moment in AI time.\n\nJulie Wieland's AI story\n\nTo get more of an inside look at the #aicinema movement, we spoke to Wieland, who's based in Germany and has racked up a sizable following on Twitter by posting eye-catching works of art generated by Midjourney. We've previously featured her work in an article about Midjourney v5, a recent upgrade to the model that added more realism.\n\nAI art has been a fruitful field for Wieland, who feels that Midjourney not only gives her a creative outlet but speeds up her professional workflow. This interview was conducted via Twitter direct messages, and her answers have been edited for clarity and length.\n\nArs: What inspired you to create AI-generated film stills?\n\nWieland: It started out with dabbling in DALL-E when I finally got my access from being on the waitlist for a few weeks. To be honest, I don't like the \"painted astronaut dog in space\" aesthetic too much that was very popular in the summer of 2022, so I wanted to test what else is out there in the AI universe. I thought that photography and movie stills would be really hard to nail, but I found ways to get good results, and I used them pretty quickly in my day-to-day job as a graphic designer for mood boards and pitches.\n\nWith Midjourney, I reduced my time from looking for inspiration from Pinterest and stock sites from two days of work to maybe 2\u20134 hours, because I can generate the exact feeling I need, to get it across for clients to know how it will \"feel.\" Onboarding illustrators, photographers, and videographers has never been easier ever since."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "RIP to Dropcams, Nest Secure: Google is shutting down servers next year", "text": "In a post on the official Google Nest Community page, Google announced it is shutting down the service for several old Nest smart home products.

Google says if users are currently subscribed to Nest Aware, they'll get a free indoor, wired Nest Cam (a $100 value). Nest Aware is a $6 or $9 monthly subscription that lets you record video from the camera and store it online. Since that subscription fee will match the price of a Nest Cam in a year or two, it makes sense for Google to try to keep that subscription revenue flowing. If you don't have a Nest Aware subscription, Google is offering a 50 percent discount on the wired, indoor Nest Cam.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Though I would encourage you to throw off the shackles of Google's always-turbulent walled garden and buy something that doesn't have a monthly fee or rely on the cloud.

Third-party devices could also plug into this system and somehow interface with your thermostat, cameras, or smoke detector.\n\nWorks with Nest got a death sentence in 2019, and has been sitting on Google death row ever since. Google originally wanted to shut down Works with Nest in August 2019, but delayed the termination after a public outcry. Google still blocked Works with Nest from adding new devices in August 2019 though, so any system has been limping along since then. If something broke, you were out of luck and couldn't replace it.\n\nAt the time, Google wanted Nest users to switch to the \"Works with Google Assistant\" ecosystem, which is the same basic idea of smart home communication, but without the \"not invented here\" baggage of the acquired Nest system. It uses a Google account instead of a Nest account, has different hardware compatibility, and, critically, it let you control devices by voice. Of course, the Google Assistant also seems to be deprioritized at Google, so Works with Google Assistant isn't called Works with Google Assistant anymore; it's now called \"Works with Google Home.\" But \"Google Home\" doesn't refer to the original Google Home product, which was a smart speaker. That line was killed off and replaced with the Nest Audio speakers. \"Google Home\" now means the app that controls your smart devices, so \"Works with Google Home\" means you'll see it in the app. The Nest app, which can also control some Nest devices, is being phased out in favor of the Google Home app."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Florida officials deleted data, stats from dubious COVID analysis: report", "text": "Florida health officials deleted key data and statistics from a state analysis on the safety of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, falsely making them appear unsafe for young men, according to draft versions of the analysis obtained by the Tampa Bay Times through public records requests.\n\nThe final analysis, which was widely criticized for its poor quality and dubious conclusions , was the basis for a statewide recommendation by Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo last October that young men, ages 18 to 39, should not receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.

He then proceeded to reverse engineer it and, with help from friend and fellow automotive security expert Ken Tindell, figure out how it worked on the CAN of the RAV4.\n\nInside this JBL speaker lies a new form of attack\n\nFurther Reading New York Times columnist falls prey to signal repeater car burglary\n\nThe research uncovered a form of keyless vehicle theft neither researcher had seen before. In the past, thieves found success using what\u2019s known as a relay attack . These hacks amplify the signal between the car and the keyless entry fob used to unlock and start it. Keyless fobs typically only communicate over distances of a few feet. By placing a simple handheld radio device near the vehicle, thieves amplify the normally faint message that cars send. With enough amplification, the messages reach the nearby home or office where the key fob is located. When the fob responds with the cryptographic message that unlocks and starts the vehicle, the crook's repeater relays it to the car. With that, the crook drives off.\n\n\u201cNow that people know how a relay attack works \u2026 car owners keep their keys in a metal box (blocking the radio message from the car) and some car makers now supply keys that go to sleep if motionless for a few minutes (and so won\u2019t receive the radio message from the car),\u201d Tindell wrote in a recent post. \u201cFaced with this defeat but being unwilling to give up a lucrative activity, thieves moved to a new way around the security: bypassing the entire smart key system.

Law enforcement concluded that the woman is now \"actively avoiding execution of the warrant.\"\n\nArs reached out the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department, but a representative did not respond to questions about the risk the woman posed to the public or the woman's current whereabouts.

It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, spits, or launches bacterial cells around them. Risk of transmission is highest during prolonged contact with an infected person. But, inhaling just a few bacterial cells is enough to cause an infection, and curing it requires lengthy antibiotic courses, spanning four to up to 20 months.\n\nTuberculosis is one of the top infectious disease killers in the world, causing 1.6 million deaths in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.

He had just turned 103 in March.\n\nFerencz died Friday evening in Boynton Beach, Florida, according to St. John\u2019s University law professor John Barrett, who runs a blog about the Nuremberg trials. The death also was confirmed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.\n\n\u201cToday the world lost a leader in the quest for justice for victims of genocide and related crimes,\u201d the museum tweeted.\n\nBorn in Transylvania in 1920, Ferencz immigrated as a very young boy with his parents to New York to escape rampant antisemitism. After graduating from Harvard Law School, Ferencz joined the U.S. Army in time to take part in the Normandy invasion during World War II. Using his legal background, he became an investigator of Nazi war crimes against U.S. soldiers as part of a new War Crimes Section of the Judge Advocate\u2019s Office.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen U.S. intelligence reports described soldiers encountering large groups of starving people in Nazi camps watched over by SS guards, Ferencz followed up with visits, first at the Ohrdruf labor camp in Germany and then at the notorious Buchenwald concentration camp. At those camps and later others, he found bodies \u201cpiled up like cordwood\u201d and \u201chelpless skeletons with diarrhea, dysentery, typhus, TB, pneumonia, and other ailments, retching in their louse ridden bunks or on the ground with only their pathetic eyes pleading for help,\u201d Ferencz wrote in an account of his life.\n\n\u201cThe Buchenwald concentration camp was a charnel house of indescribable horrors,\u201d Ferencz wrote. \u201cThere is no doubt that I was indelibly traumatized by my experiences as a war crimes investigator of Nazi extermination centers. I still try not to talk or think about the details.\u201d\n\nAt one point toward the end of the war, Ferencz was sent to Adolf Hitler\u2019s mountain retreat in the Bavarian Alps to search for incriminating documents but came back empty-handed.\n\nAfter the war, Ferencz was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army and returned to New York to begin practicing law. But that was short-lived. Because of his experiences as a war crimes investigator, he was recruited to help prosecute Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg trials, which had begun under the leadership of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson. Before leaving for Germany, he married his childhood sweetheart, Gertrude.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the age of 27, with no previous trial experience, Ferencz became chief prosecutor for a 1947 case in which 22 former commanders were charged with murdering over 1 million Jews, Romani and other enemies of the Third Reich in Eastern Europe. Rather than depending on witnesses, Ferencz mostly relied on official German documents to make his case. All the defendants were convicted, and more than a dozen were sentenced to death by hanging even though Ferencz hadn\u2019t asked for the death penalty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of April 1948, when the long legal judgment was read, I felt vindicated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOur pleas to protect humanity by the rule of law had been upheld.\u201d\n\nWith the war crimes trials winding down, Ferencz went to work for a consortium of Jewish charitable groups to help Holocaust survivors regain properties, homes, businesses, art works, Torah scrolls, and other Jewish religious items that had been confiscated from them by the Nazis. He also later assisted in negotiations that would lead to compensation to the Nazi victims.\n\nIn later decades, Ferencz championed the creation of an international court which could prosecute any government\u2019s leaders for war crimes. Those dreams were realized in 2002 with establishment of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, though its effectiveness has been limited by the failure of countries like the United States to participate.\n\nFerencz is survived by a son and three daughters. His wife died in 2019.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP"}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Competing abortion pill rulings sow broad alarm, confusion", "text": "FILE - Three members of the Women's March group protest in support of access to abortion medication outside the Federal Courthouse on Wednesday, March 15, 2023 in Amarillo, Texas.

(AP Photo/David Erickson)\n\nEmma Hernandez is defiant even if she fears what may come in the latest stage of the nation\u2019s fight over abortion: a widening prohibition to safe and legal ways to end unwanted pregnancies, including access to abortion pills .\n\nCompeting rulings by two federal judges over the availability of the abortion drug mifepristone are sowing alarm and confusion for Hernandez and countless other Americans who insist that availability must be guaranteed. Others celebrated one judge\u2019s ruling that would restrict that access but acknowledge the battle is far from over.\n\nHernandez\u2019s concerns were heightened Friday when U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk , a Trump appointee in Amarillo, Texas, overruled decades of scientific approval and put on hold federal approval of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in combination to end pregnancies. The judge immediately stayed his ruling for a week so federal authorities could file a challenge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt about the same time in Spokane, Washington, U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice, an Obama appointee, directed federal officials not to hinder access to the drug in at least 17 states where Democrats sued to keep the drug\u2019s availability intact. The issue will likely be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court, which last year repealed Roe v. Wade , the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that had established a constitutional right to abortions.\n\n\u201cAs a person who\u2019s had multiple medication abortions, we know that the medication itself is safe and effective,\u201d said Hernandez, a 30-year-old Texas resident who works for We Testify, an organization that provides an outlet for people to share their stories about abortions.\n\n\u201cThese restrictions are intentionally creating confusion and limiting our options to a point where we\u2019re being asked to accept whatever abortion option remains available,\u201d she said Saturday.\n\nAbortion opponents like Rose Mimms, the executive director of Arkansas Right to Life, welcomed the Texas decision.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really going to put a big dent in the abortion industry across the country, (but) I do expect it will be appealed,\u201d Mimms said.\n\nWhile some states like hers have sharply curtailed access to abortions, she wants stricter controls over abortion-inducing medications that can be delivered through the mail, even in states where abortion is illegal or severely restricted.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his ruling, Kacsmaryk noted how some groups are undermining a state\u2019s ability to regulate abortion. He specifically mentioned New York-based Mayday Health, a nonprofit that provides information on how to obtain the medication.\n\nMayday Health\u2019s executive director, Dr. Jennifer Lincoln, urged women to begin stockpiling mifepristone in case it is banned. She said pills can be obtained from international suppliers through the mail.\n\n\u201cYou can order them now and keep mifepristone like you would keep Tylenol. It has a shelf life of about two years,\u201d said Lincoln, a Portland, Oregon, obstetrician and gynecologist.\n\nAbout a million people every month visit the organization\u2019s website. Following the Texas ruling, Lincoln said, the number of visits has become even more brisk.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe know those numbers will climb when people see that safe healthcare is threatened,\u201d she said.\n\nRenee Bracey Sherman, founder and executive director of We Testify, said she is \u201cfrustrated that access to abortion care is hanging on by a thread.\u201d\n\nWhile mifepristone and misoprostol, another abortion-inducing drug, remain available in the U.S., Sherman calls the court battle and debate over the drugs \u201ca very slippery slope\u201d toward an outright ban on abortion in any form.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during an interview Saturday on CNN that she would push legislation that would require insurance companies to cover misoprostol, which can be used alone but is more effective when taken with mifepristone.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also concerned about the next phase,\u201d Hochul said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to figure out all the different ways we can get ahead of this.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, abortion foes have won major victories, and they have become more emboldened in their efforts to further erode access to abortions, said Hernandez.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we saw around the bend,\u201d she said. \u201cI do know that we\u2019ve been preparing for these moments and understanding how we can get people to still have access in whatever way is available in their region.\u201d\n\nThe growing restrictions could particularly hurt people who don\u2019t have the resources to travel to such places as California and New York to get in-clinic abortions.\n\nHernandez recalls her first abortion when she was 21. She didn\u2019t want to reveal her pregnancy to anyone; to retain her privacy, she relied on medication to abort her pregnancy. Without access to a car, she would not have had a convenient way to get to a clinic.\n\n\u201cFor me it was the best option because it did not require any sort of sedation,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cAnd I did not have a support system that could assist me in traveling to and from a clinic for an abortion procedure.\u201d\n\n__________\n\nCalvan reported from New York and Miller from Oklahoma City."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "NBA opens investigation into Dallas' move to sit players", "text": "Dallas Mavericks' Luka Doncic, left, Josh Green, center, and Kyrie Irving, right, stand on the court during a timeout in the second half of an NBA basketball game against the Chicago Bulls, Friday, April 7, 2023, in Dallas.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)\n\nThe NBA wants to know why the Dallas Mavericks held out several key players in their next-to-last game of the season, even while the team still had a mathematical chance of making the play-in tournament.\n\nNBA officials opened an investigation Saturday into the Mavericks\u2019 decision-making surrounding Friday\u2019s game against the Chicago Bulls , in which Dallas sat Kyrie Irving for the entire game and Luka Doncic for most of the contest. The Mavericks blew an 11-point fourth-quarter lead and lost, getting eliminated from postseason consideration.\n\nThat outcome also could help ensure that Dallas has a top-10 draft pick this summer \u2014 and with it, potentially a 4.5% chance of winning the lottery and getting the opportunity to select French phenom Victor Wembanyama.\n\n\u201cThe NBA commenced an investigation today into the facts and circumstances surrounding the Dallas Mavericks\u2019 roster decisions and game conduct with respect to last night\u2019s Chicago Bulls-Mavericks game, including the motivations behind those actions,\u201d league spokesman Mike Bass said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPotential penalties are unclear, though Commissioner Adam Silver made clear before the season began that the league wouldn\u2019t tolerate any obvious attempts at tanking.\n\n\u201cI know that many of our NBA teams are salivating at the notion that potentially through our lottery that they could get (Wembanyama), so they should all still compete very hard next season,\u201d Silver said in October.\n\nDallas coach Jason Kidd said before the game that the decision to sit players was made by \u201cthe organization,\u201d and referenced it being made by his bosses \u2014 owner Mark Cuban and general manager Nico Harrison \u2014 after the game as well.\n\nDallas had Irving, Tim Hardaway Jr., Maxi Kleber, Josh Green and Christian Wood all out for Friday\u2019s win-or-else game, and it limited Doncic to about one quarter of play before pulling him for the remainder of the contest. Doncic played briefly on a night that paid tribute to his native Slovenia, with the Mavericks handing out souvenir Slovenia-themed scarves to the first 3,500 fans in attendance. He came out less than a minute into the second quarter.\n\nThe Mavs cited right foot injury recovery for Irving, right hamstring injury recovery for Kleber, left ankle soreness for Hardaway and rest for both Wood and Green. All five of those players \u2014 plus Doncic \u2014 played Wednesday in Dallas\u2019 win over Sacramento.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe organization, they made this decision,\u201d Kidd said before Friday\u2019s game, later adding, \u201cwe have to go by that.\u201d\n\nPostgame, Kidd added: \u201cThis is maybe a step back, but hopefully it leads to going forward. ... These are decisions that are made from my bosses and we\u2019ve got to follow them and we trust that Cuban and Nico are going to put the pieces together to put us in a position to win a championship. And that\u2019s just starting the process today.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Mavericks have caught the NBA\u2019s eye when it comes to tanking.\n\nThe NBA fined Cuban $600,000 in February 2018 for comments about tanking during a podcast with Basketball Hall of Fame player Julius Erving, which Commissioner Adam Silver called \u201cpublic statements detrimental to the NBA.\u201d The Mavericks were well on their way to what became a 24-58 season when Cuban spoke to Erving and discussed tanking.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLater, Cuban acknowledged to The Associated Press that he \u201cearned\u201d the fine. \u201cI got excited talking to Dr. J and said something I shouldn\u2019t have,\u201d he told the AP at the time.\n\nDallas, in fairness, was in an uphill spot for the last play-in berth in the West anyway entering Friday, and beating the Bulls would have extended postseason hopes but would not have guaranteed anything. It needed to win Friday and Sunday and hope that Oklahoma City would lose to Memphis on Sunday \u2014 just to get the No. 10 spot and still need two more road wins in play-in games to make it to a Round 1 series against Denver.\n\nNot making the play-in tournament helps Dallas\u2019 chances of claiming no worse than the No. 10 pick in this summer\u2019s draft \u2014 which is important. If the Mavs\u2019 pick is between No. 1 and No. 10, Dallas keeps it. If it is No. 11 or deeper in the draft, it conveys to New York as part of the compensation agreed to in the Kristaps Porzingis trade in 2019.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NBA investigation comes just days after the league denied a protest by the Mavericks over a confusing sequence that led to an uncontested basket for Golden State in a two-point win by the Warriors in a game last month.\n\nThat loss was part of a freefall by the Mavericks, who were fourth in the West in mid-February and figured to become a title contender after trading for Irving to play alongside Doncic in a suddenly starry backcourt.\n\nBut the Mavericks have gone 7-17 in their last 24 games, with only Sunday\u2019s now-meaningless finale against San Antonio remaining.\n\n___\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Koepka leading Rahm by 4 on a short Saturday at the Masters", "text": "Patrons leave the course after play was suspended in the weather delayed third round of the Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club on Saturday, April 8, 2023, in Augusta, Ga.

So I don\u2019t think anybody should have a problem with that.\u201d\n\nThe lasting image was thousands of spectators under their green-and-white Masters umbrellas moving slowly in unison toward the exit.\n\nThere was plenty of entertainment in the short window of golf, most of it in the morning when the second round was completed.\n\nTemperatures didn\u2019t quite reach 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). The rain and wind made it feel worse, and playing conditions were so severe that hardly anyone could reach the par 5s. Some players were hitting fairway metal on the par-4 18th.\n\nRahm did remarkably well to close the gap on Koepka, getting to within one shot when he holed a birdie putt from just off the back of the 17th green. But he came up short of the 18th with a 4-iron \u2014 he hit 8-iron into the 18th hole in warm weather on Thursday \u2014 and made bogey for a 69.\n\n\u201cThose two holes at the end, 17 and 18, were two absolute monsters,\u201d Rahm said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCameron Young summed it for some three dozen players who were forced to handle the rain, the cold and a course that played longer than it ever has on Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible,\u201d Young said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what you\u2019re supposed to do.\u201d\n\nPlayers lost tee shots to the right because of water on the face of the club \u2014 even after wiping it dry before they hit. Shots were skidding across rain-soaked greens. The ball was going nowhere.\n\nKoepka was among the fortunate who finished his second round in the warm breeze on Friday before the bad weather moved in and changed everything.\n\nWhile it was the first time at the Masters that two players finished 36 holes at double digits under par, this felt more like survival.\n\nNo one paid the price quite like Justin Thomas. He returned to the course at 2 under for the tournament and began losing ground quickly, with a shot into the water on the 11th for a double bogey, a tee shot over the back of the green on the par-3 12th and a three-putt bogey on the par-5 15th from 45 feet.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWoods had his own issues. He was hovering around the cut line \u2014 he had never missed the cut as a pro at Augusta \u2014 when he finished bogey-bogey to fall outside the top 50 and ties. He needed either Thomas or Sungjae Im to bogey one of the last two holes to make it.\n\nBoth obliged, but Thomas wound up making bogey on Nos. 17 and 18. He had to hit 5-wood into the 18th, pulled it into the gallery and missed a 10-foot putt for a 42 on the back nine and a 78, matching his worst score in the Masters.\n\nThere was a brief respite in the rain, and then out came the umbrellas not long after the third round began.\n\nU.S. Amateur champion Sam Bennett, who at 8-under 136 had the lowest 36-hole score by an amateur since Ken Venturi in 1956, promptly bogeyed his opening two holes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was brutal out there,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI think they honestly could have called it about 45 minutes earlier, but they tried their best.\u201d\n\nKoepka and Rahm each birdied the par-5 second hole, but then Rahm got out of position on the par-3 fourth for bogey, and three-putted from long range on the fifth. But he ended his day with two good swings and then was done for the day.\n\nHaving to complete the third round on Sunday morning is not unusual. The last two times for weather delays on Saturday (2005 and 2006), play resumed and was stopped by darkness. This time it was 3:15 p.m., an abrupt and early end.\n\nThe forecast for Sunday should allow for the Masters to finish as scheduled. But even as rain clears, it is sure to leave a softer Augusta National that can be attacked.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s good weather tomorrow \u2014 so we\u2019re going to have good weather conditions and most likely a soft golf course,\u201d Rahm said.\n\nPatrick Cantlay and U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick were 3 under for the second round, the best of scoring on this miserable day. They were tied for fourth, along with Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland, still eight shots behind.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPhil Mickelson also was in the mix. The three-time Masters champion had two early birdies before giving them back. He was in the group at 4-under par and headed to the back nine when play was stopped.\n\nWoods ended Saturday morning with two bogeys and started Saturday afternoon \u2014 he was in the last group on the back nine \u2014 with another one. But it really got ugly at the end. His wedge to the 15th spun off the green and into the water. And on the par-3 16th, with a front right pin, he went well left and into the water.\n\nBut in only his fourth tournament since last year\u2019s Masters, he was still playing. He joined Fred Couples and Gary Player in the Masters record book with his 23rd straight cut made. Couples carved out his own spot in the book. At age 63, he became the oldest player to make the cut at the Masters.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Mobile home park residents form co-ops to save their homes", "text": "Mobile home park residents form co-ops to save their homes\n\nClaire Rush Statehouse reporter based in Portland, Oregon. ClaireARushcrush@ap.org\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. (AP) \u2014 When Gadiel Galvez learned that the owner of his mobile home park south of Seattle was looking to sell, he and other residents worried their largely Latino community would be bulldozed to make way for another Amazon warehouse.\n\nSo, they decided to form a cooperative and buy their park in Lakewood, Washington. With help from a nonprofit that advises communities like theirs and helps them secure loans, they bought it for $5.25 million. Since becoming owners in September, everyone\u2019s worked to make improvements.\n\n\u201cEverybody thought, \u2018You know what? ... I\u2019m going to make this place the best that I can,\u2019\u201d said Galvez, 22, who is a co-op board member. \u201cSome people painted their homes, some people remodeled their interiors and exteriors, and some are working on their roofs.\u201d\n\nWith rents rising at mobile home parks nationwide, advocates tout the cooperative model as a way to preserve one of the last affordable housing options for people with low- or fixed-incomes and to give them a greater voice in managing their parks.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo far these resident-owned communities are proving to be a reliable option. None of the more than 300 in the network of nonprofit ROC USA have defaulted or closed. One decided to sell back to the county housing authority it originally purchased from.\n\n\u201cThey have a 100% track record of success, which tells you that it\u2019s working for the residents,\u201d said George McCarthy, president and CEO of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, think tank. \u201cResident ownership is an absolute bulwark against the intrusion of institutional capital in the market.\u201d\n\nThe push to promote resident ownership comes as parks have become a favorite target of investment banks, hedge funds and other deep-pocketed investors.\n\nNearly a third of mobile home parks in the U.S. have been bought by such investors since 2015, lured by reliable cash flow and high returns from raising rents at nearly double the general rental market rate, McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trading on the desperation of people living in the parks,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place that they can take their homes if they can\u2019t afford to keep paying the increasing rents.\u201d\n\nPark residents often own their home but rarely the land beneath it. So if a landlord raises rent, residents can be evicted or forced to sell their home. If a park is sold to be redeveloped, mobile homes that can\u2019t be moved are demolished.\n\nFull Coverage: Photography\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHomelessness is really what residents are facing\u201d if investors aggressively raise rents, said Victoria O\u2019Banion, ROC Northwest\u2019s marketing and acquisitions specialist.\n\nAt Rimrock Court in the central Oregon town of Madras, rent increased from $350 to $495 over five years. When the owner notified residents he planned to sell, they feared further increases \u2014 or worse, that it would be torn down to make way for apartments. So they decided to buy it.\n\n\u201cWe were really worried about being forced out of our homes,\u201d said Shawn King, who lives there with her husband on a fixed income and had experienced homelessness before.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo pay off the purchase loan, residents now pay $520 a month \u2014 a stretch, but one that comes with reassurance, King said.\n\n\u201cJust to have that peace of mind, to know that our rent is going to be locked in for awhile and not keep going up, and also knowing that our rent monies ... are going back into the property, that is the cool part,\u201d she said.\n\nThe required rent increase to go co-op was even steeper in Evergreen Village Cooperative in Mount Bethel, Pennsylvania, \u2014 from $460 a month to $750 to pay off the $12 million loan.\n\nStill, more than two-thirds of residents voted in favor, figuring their rent would stabilize in the long run.\n\n\u201cWe are not for profit. All the money that we get has to go back into the village and pay the mortgages off,\u201d said Stephen Laclair, board president.\n\nEvergreen Village has earmarked funds for improvement projects for the next decade, and this year plans to enhance the sewer plant and fix electrical issues, he said.\n\nCo-ops can also provide social support to residents. At Liberty Landing Cooperative in Missouri, residents started a food pantry to help neighbors in need.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s a hardship, we\u2019re willing to work with somebody. ... It\u2019s emotional when you find out that somebody\u2019s lost their job, their child support ... and they don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Kristi Peterman, the board vice president. \u201cOur president likes to say: \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work for the poorest of us then it\u2019s not going to work for anybody.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite the talk of better management and stronger community, most parks aren\u2019t co-ops.\n\nThe country\u2019s roughly 43,000 mobile home communities are home to 22 million people, according to the Manufactured Housing Institute, a national trade organization. But only about 1,000 are resident-owned, according to Carolyn Carter, deputy director at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nSome resistance comes from residents, many of whom are seniors and people with disabilities who may not want the responsibility of managing their park. Others argue rent control or stricter zoning regulations protecting mobile home parks from redevelopment are more effective.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cZoning is critical. ... That is what we ought to be fighting for everywhere,\u201d said Jan Leonard, who lives in a park in Walla Walla, Washington, and worked with other residents to successfully push the city council to amend zoning codes to add mobile home parks as a land-use type.\n\nOther residents considering buying their parks are running up against the same forces that make them popular with investors \u2014 a red-hot market and competition from private equity firms and other prospective buyers.\n\nSarah Marchant, vice president of Community Loan Fund, ROC USA\u2019s New Hampshire affiliate, recalled Tara Estates, a 380-home park in Rochester. The steep $45 million asking price discouraged residents from organizing.\n\nAnother challenge is that few states provide funding for residents looking to buy their parks. The lack of grants can make it difficult for residents to finance large loans.\n\nNew Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon are among states with laws that have been effective in helping residents buy their parks, the National Consumer Law Center said.\n\nA new bill in Oregon would allocate $35 million in grants to help residents purchase their parks. Washington passed a bill last month requiring that landlords offer tenants a chance to compete to purchase their park. It also requires two years\u2019 notice if a park will be closed, although that can be reduced if landlords financially compensate residents.\n\nMobile homes are \u201can important and affordable housing option for a lot of folks, especially older people aging in place, and we need to make sure it\u2019s preserved,\u201d said state Sen. Noel Frame, the Washington bill\u2019s prime sponsor.\n\nSome real estate groups and park owners argue the bill places an undue burden on landlords.\n\n\u201cIf you want tenants to organize and make offers to purchase their communities ... they should not wait until there\u2019s a clock ticking,\u201d said Robert Cochran, property manager of Contempo Mobile Home Park in Spokane.\n\nHousing advocates say they hope that $225 million in recently approved federal funding may provide some relief for mobile home park residents . Starting this year, the money will be funneled through grants to states, resident-owned parks, nonprofits, and local and tribal governments to preserve mobile home communities and improve infrastructure.\n\nKing cherishes the mobile home that going cooperative at Oregon\u2019s Rimrock Court saved from rent increases and a potential buyout by investors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to find affordable housing when you\u2019re low income. To be able to own your own home is so empowering,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 600-square-feet. It\u2019s not much, but it\u2019s a castle to me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP writer Michael Casey in Boston contributed."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Report: Florida officials cut key data from vaccine study", "text": "FILE - Dr. Joseph Ladapo speaks with reporters after the Florida Senate confirmed his appointment as the state's surgeon general on Feb. 23, 2022, in Tallahassee, Fla.

(AP) \u2014 An analysis that was the basis of a highly criticized recommendation from Florida\u2019s surgeon general cautioning young men against getting the COVID-19 vaccine omitted information that showed catching the virus could increase the risk of a cardiac-related death much more than getting the mRNA shot, according to drafts of the analysis obtained by the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nThe nonbinding recommendation made by Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo last fall ran counter to the advice provided by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Ladapo, a Harvard-trained medical doctor who was appointed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2021 to head the Florida Department of Health, has drawn intense scrutiny over his shared resistance with the Republican governor to COVID-19 mandates for vaccines and masks and other health policies endorsed by the federal government.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe early drafts of the analysis obtained by the Times through a records request showed that catching COVID-19 could increase the chances of a cardiac-related death much more than getting the vaccine, but that information was missing from the final version put out by the Florida Department of Health last October.\n\nLadapo said that the risk of men ages 18 to 39 having cardiac complications outweighed the benefits of getting the mRNA vaccine.\n\nMatt Hitchings, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida, told the Times that it seems that sections of the analysis were omitted because they did not fit the narrative the surgeon general wanted to push.\n\n\u201cThis is a grave violation of research integrity,\u201d Hitchings said. \u201c(The vaccine) has done a lot to advance the health of people of Florida and he\u2019s encouraging people to mistrust it.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on Twitter posted Saturday in response to the Times\u2019 story, Ladapo said, \u201cIt\u2019s not only unfortunate that COVID has corrupted scientists\u2019 ability to think clearly about epidemiology but also sad that people rush to defend a vaccine that has shown increased cardiovascular risk in multiple studies.\u201d\n\nLast year, Ladapo released guidance recommending against vaccinations for healthy children, contradicting federal public health leaders whose advice says all kids should get the shots . In response, the American Academy of Pediatrics and its Florida chapter issued written statements reiterating support for vaccinating eligible children age 5 and older against COVID-19.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDeSantis, who is contemplating a run for the GOP presidential nomination, also has requested that a grand jury be convened to investigate any wrongdoing with respect to the COVID-19 vaccines.

But Race Lessar and Landen Ozzello are finally right where they want to be, on a snowy slope close to home, molding snow into a ski jump.\n\nTheir local ski mountain just reopened.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that it\u2019s open for at least one year,\u201d Lessar said. It opened as a nonprofit, and that may be the key. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that there was a hope,\u201d he said.\n\nHis ties to the mountain are so close, he\u2019s practically named after it. His dad used to race here and named his son for what brought him joy. Chad Lessar first skied on hand-me-down gear and later worked summers at a nearby ranch to earn money for more nimble racing equipment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been very rich,\u201d Chad said of Huerfano, one of the poorest counties in the state. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see a little area open up on the cheap,\u201d he said. The ski runs here are short, but the fact it\u2019s affordable just might be enough to keep it up and running.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnder the gaze of the imposing Spanish Peaks in southern Colorado, the 50-acre Parker-Fitzgerald Cuchara Mountain Park is the story of so many American ski areas, only the community was determined to change the script.\n\nSki resorts boomed in the 70s and 80s, emerging even in areas that didn\u2019t have the climate or workers to sustain them long-term. First-time ski resort owners took on debt and quickly filed for bankruptcy after a bad snow season. Ownerships transferred numerous times before resorts calcified into ghost towns.\n\nBut some communities are now finding a niche, offering an alternative to endless lift lines and soaring ticket prices. They\u2019re reopening, several as nonprofits, offering a mom-and-pop experience at a far lower cost than corporate-owned resorts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily about drawing overnight or out-of-town guests, but about bringing positive economic impact and a source of physical and mental wellness for the community,\u201d said Adrienne Isaac, marketing director for the National Ski Areas Association.\n\n(AP Video/Brittany Peterson)\n\nA DELAYED REOPENING\n\nCuchara shuttered in 2000 after years of mismanagement, unpredictable snow and bankruptcies. It was dead for 16 years, when a group of stubborn locals with fond memories of the mountain came together. When the last owner put it up for sale, the Cuchara Foundation gave the county a down payment and helped raise the remaining funds.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoing into this season, the work of readying was in full swing. Volunteers kept holding fundraisers. There were donation jars. Inheriting snowmaking equipment and lifts may sound good, said Ken Clayton, a board member at Panadero Ski Corporation, a sister nonprofit that runs operations. But both required expensive repairs, and then the refurbished chairlift didn\u2019t even pass inspection. On top of that, it was a warm, dry winter. As the season wore on, the volunteers began to lose hope of reopening. \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t going to happen because we didn\u2019t have the snow,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nFinally, when cold air and snowstorms arrived in late winter, Cuchara\u2019s maintenance director had an idea. They welded old school bus seats to a car-hauling trailer and hitched it to a snowcat, a tractor with snow treads, then put out the word they would be towing people up the mountain. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to give the community something because they\u2019ve supported us for so long,\u201d Clayton said.\n\nAnd the community showed up.\n\nGROWING ACCESS\n\nThere\u2019s no guidebook for how to reopen an abandoned ski area, especially as a nonprofit, so some community groups are making common cause, and learning from each other.\n\nWill Pirkey had heard of a nonprofit ski area six hundred miles north in Wyoming, and sought them out as soon as he joined the volunteer board. The Antelope Butte Foundation had been running a nonprofit ski area in northern Wyoming since 2018 after a closure that lasted 15 years. With a limited, mostly volunteer staff, it opens Friday through Monday. Keeping skiing affordable, especially for children, is key to its mission.\n\nFor $320, a child can receive a season pass to the Wyoming mountain, rentals, and four lessons. The foundation covers families who can\u2019t afford the cost. They also host classes for area schools that introduce kids to cross country and downhill skiing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGreybull Middle School Principal Cadance Wipplinger used to chaperone students to ski areas when she taught in a Montana town with a robust outdoor industry. But her students now mainly come from mining, railroad, and farming families with fewer resources.\n\n\u201cA high percentage of our kids would not be getting the opportunity if we weren\u2019t taking them,\u201d Wipplinger said. \u201cIt opens up their world a little bit.\u201d\n\nA FUTURE WITH SHORTER, WEIRDER WINTERS\n\nIf fond memories and volunteer spirit are essential to reopening an abandoned ski area as a nonprofit, so is snow, and its consistency dictates whether it can endure.\n\nThe Antelope Butte Foundation studied 30 years of snow patterns before committing to reopen, board president Ryan White said, but knew it would face ever-shorter winters. As greenhouse gas emissions warm the atmosphere , winter is growing shorter and there are also more dramatic swings, for example last year\u2019s snow drought in the Sierra Nevada followed by this year\u2019s record snowfall.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis season, Antelope Butte was buried in powder, said former Executive Director Rebecca Arcarese, but she knows other years won\u2019t be as abundant. Snowmaking could extend the season, but it\u2019s a tough decision for a mountain that doesn\u2019t have the personnel to open seven days a week.\n\n\u201cDoes it give us two, three more weeks, or just two or three more days? And does that make sense to make that capital investment?\u201d Arcarese asked.\n\nIn southeast Vermont, irregular snow has long plagued standalone Mount Ascutney. A local nonprofit reopened Ascutney after five years of closure. A few seasons ago, a storm dumped several feet of snow on the slopes, but a week later, rain washed it away.\n\n\u201cIf you spend one hundred thousand dollars on making snow, your heart gets broken when it\u2019s washed down the mountain,\u201d said Steve Crihfield, a board member of Ascutney Outdoors, the nonprofit that owns and manages the mountain.\n\nSo ski areas are dealing with climate risk by offering year-round activities from archery to concerts and weddings. But in a quiet town like La Veta, with limited outdoor winter activities and a population of fewer than 1000, there is just no substitute yet for snow sports.\n\nOn a late Sunday afternoon in March, energy pulses at the Mountain Merman Brewing Company \u2014 one of the few bars in town. Pints sling across the counter to construction workers wearing ski pants, while windburned teenagers \u2014 Lessar and his pals \u2014 nosh chicken barbecue pizza and play Battleship.\n\nThe shift is so busy, co-owner Jen Lind is having to help behind the bar. She hardly recognizes the energy in her brewery compared to its typically mellow pace at the end of a weekend.\n\n\u201cI think that comes right off the mountain,\u201d Lind said. \u201cPeople are excited to be out and about and having stuff to do.\u201d\n\n____\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

Its region includes the Bab el-Mandeb Strait off Yemen and the Red Sea stretching up to the Suez Canal, the Egyptian waterway linking the Mideast to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.S., the U.K. and Israel have accused Iran of targeting oil tankers and commercial ships in recent years, allegations denied by Tehran. The U.S. Navy has also reported a series of tense encounters at sea with Iranian forces that it said were being recklessly aggressive.\n\nLast month, the U.S. launched airstrikes against Iran-backed forces in Syria after a rocket attack killed a U.S. contractor and wounded seven other Americans in that country\u2019s northeast.\n\nTomahawk cruise missiles launched from ships or submarines can hit targets up to 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles away).

A third Democrat was spared expulsion by a one-vote margin.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe removal of the lawmakers, who were only recently elected, reflects a trend in dozens of states where Republicans are trying to make it harder to cast ballots and challenging the integrity of the election process.\n\nAt least 177 bills restricting voting or creating systems that can intimidate voters or permit partisan interference were filed or introduced in dozens of states so far this year, according to the Brennan Center.\n\n\u201cIt represents a really slow erosion of our democracy,\u201d said Neha Patel, co-executive director of the State Innovation Exchange, a strategy center for state legislators working toward progressive policies.\n\nPatel called the expulsions \u201cthe third prong of a long-range strategy.\u201d She said it was once \u201cunprecedented\u201d for states to make it harder for people to vote, but the practice has become \u201ccommonplace.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also become common for the GOP to challenge the electoral process and raise questions about election integrity. The next question is whether states with Republican supermajorities will follow Tennessee\u2019s lead in expelling opponents with different points of view, she said.\n\nFred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan organization advocating for better government, said expulsions have generally been reserved for lawmakers involved in criminal activity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVoters losing their chosen representatives for doing their jobs is \u201cunheard of,\u201d Wertheimer said. He has not learned of any similar action in other states, \u201cbut this stuff travels.\u201d\n\nThe action in Tennessee drew outcries from a range of groups.\n\nNational Urban League President Marc Morial said the issue was about race, but \u201cit\u2019s not only about race. It\u2019s about basic American values.\u201d\n\nReferring to the right to vote, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, he said, \u201cIt appears as though the Tennessee Legislature needs a refresher on the American Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe president of the Congressional Black Caucus, Nevada Rep. Steven Horsford, called for the Tennessee lawmakers to be returned to their seats and for Attorney General Merrick Garland to look into potential violations of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson said the civil rights organization was prepared to take legal action \u201cto ensure that this heinous attempt to silence the voice of the people is addressed in a court of law.\u201d\n\nHouse Speaker Cameron Sexton pushed back against criticism that he was leaving thousands of Tennesseans without representation and taking away their voice.\n\n\u201cThere are consequences for actions,\u201d he said. \u201cThose members took away the voice of this chamber for 45 minutes when they were on the House floor leading the protest and disrupting the business that we\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe trio\u2019s participation in the demonstration lasted only a few minutes. It was Sexton who called for a recess to meet with lawmakers.\n\nWebb questioned why Jones and Pearson would be expelled while Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is white, was not.\n\nClayton Cardwell, who lives in Jones\u2019 district in Nashville, said in a telephone interview that the protest in favor of stricter gun laws last week was \u201cthe right thing to do.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI was hoping that the entire House would join in,\u201d he said. When the retired teacher was getting his master\u2019s degree in special education, Cardwell remembers being told that teaching was the safest occupation you could have. \u201cNow I think it is one of the most dangerous.\u201d\n\nCardwell, who is white, also questioned the motives behind the expulsions: \u201cWe\u2019ve just got a lot of old white men there who are prejudiced.\u201d\n\nNashville attorney Chris Wood was so concerned about the possible expulsion of his representative that he went to the Capitol on Thursday to watch the proceedings.\n\n\u201cIt was appalling,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an abuse of power.\u201d\n\nWood has three children in public schools and called it \u201cunbelievable and immoral\u201d that the Republican majority would refuse to even consider gun restrictions.\n\nNo issue could be more important to the community \u201cthan ending gun violence and letting our kids come home at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only country in the world where this happens.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWood expects Jones and Pearson to be back soon. They could be reappointed to the House by county commissions in their districts and run again in a special election.\n\nAndrea Wiley, a lifelong Tennessee resident who lives and works in Pearson\u2019s district, said she was embarrassed for the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be from here and see us in the national news at this level,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is really scary to me that I don\u2019t have a voice in Nashville that\u2019s representing me, my community, my neighborhood.\u201d\n\nTamala Johnson said she and her family voted for Pearson and she agreed with him about changing gun laws.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he should have been expelled for voicing his opinion,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe vote to expel \u201cmakes me feel like we don\u2019t have a word,\u201d she said. \u201cYou threw him out just because he\u2019s fighting to improve gun laws. \u2026 There\u2019s no trust.\u201d\n\n____\n\nSainz reported from Memphis, Tennessee.

But the appeal of Ethereum\u2019s underlying technology has endured.\n\n2. What is the Shanghai upgrade?\n\nUntil September 2022, Ethereum relied on a costly, energy-intensive process known as proof-of-work to order transactions. That changed when a technical overhaul known as the \u201cMerge\u201d applied an alternative approach \u2014 proof-of-stake.\n\nPeople who put up, or stake, Ether can become \u201cvalidators\u201d of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain and receive an income in return \u2014 much like deposits at a bank. Since 2020, users have been able to stake their Ether but couldn\u2019t withdraw it. Shanghai will allow them to take those coins out. About 16 per cent of total Ether supply, worth around $US37 billion ($55 billion), was stuck in the protocol for staking as of early April.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Why is this a sensitive moment?\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how many users will want to cash out once their Ether is unlocked. The token\u2019s value has fluctuated wildly in the years since staking was first enabled \u2014 soaring as its popularity grew with institutional and retail investors, then tumbling in 2022.\n\nAt least initially, demand for withdrawals is expected to outweigh new staking deposits on Ethereum. Longer-term, the opportunity to withdraw staked tokens is likely to make Ether staking more appealing as it will reduce risk for those involved.\n\nInvestors also expect volatility in so-called liquid-staking tokens, which represent staked Ether and can be used in decentralised-finace apps that let people lend, borrow and trade coins. Prices of some of these tokens have risen in recent months and risk falling in tandem with Ether around the time of the Shanghai upgrade.\n\n4. Will people be able to withdraw staked Ether right away?\n\nThey\u2019ll have to join queues, which may be longer or shorter depending on where their stakes are being held. The process is likely to be more complicated for holders of liquid-staking tokens such as Lido.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe service, which holds roughly a third of staked Ether, expects to enable withdrawals in May. It could take months for Ether holders to withdraw their coins as Ethereum has put limits in place to make sure too many people don\u2019t withdraw at once, leaving it vulnerable to an attack.\n\n5. Could there be technical problems?\n\nThere\u2019s a chance of glitches as Shanghai goes live. During a recent test of the code, transaction confirmations took much longer than expected as many computers handling the process hadn\u2019t had a software upgrade.\n\nStill, Ethereum developers have a track record of seamless software changes. There\u2019s also a risk that some nodes in the broader Ethereum blockchain that are holding staked Ether may have lost the keys that enable access to the coins, leaving users shut out.\n\n6. Any other concerns?\n\nSince the Merge, Ether has drawn scrutiny from regulators including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which has indicated that certain services offering yields from staking cryptocurrencies amount to illegal securities offerings. The Shanghai upgrade, by allowing staked Ether to be unlocked, could result in stepped-up scrutiny.\n\nBloomberg"}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "KPMG, Goldman Sachs faulted in suit over SVB failure", "text": "SVB collapsed last month following bets on bonds that lost value as interest rates rose.

If Australia\u2019s rates remain well below foreign peers, the Australian dollar is likely to weaken further below the US67\u00a2 it was trading at on Wednesday and increase imported inflation.\n\nThe long pause?\n\nWe might be about to test Lowe\u2019s theory that monetary policy operates with more potency in Australia.\n\nHSBC economist Paul Bloxham believes the RBA is done raising rates and is preparing for a \u201clong pause\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe pause is in contrast to some other central banks that have continued to hike recently,\u201d Bloxham says. \u201cWe see the RBA as putting a higher priority on delivering a soft economic landing than other central banks, which appear more focused on getting inflation down more quickly, even if it means a recession.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the RBA chief\u2019s ambition is to tread the fraught, narrow path to tame inflation and cement a low unemployment rate below 5 per cent. That would be a fitting legacy for Lowe, who has capped his 40 years in central banking with a seven-year term as governor, expiring in September.\n\nBut it will be easier said than done. The RBA could have more monetary policy tightening to do to get inflation down from 7.8 per cent in the December quarter to the 2 per cent to 3 per cent target by its mid-2025 forecast.\n\nThe central bank will be hoping that March quarter inflation falls to about 6.5 per cent when the data is released on April 26. But if inflation proves sticky, Lowe will feel compelled to raise interest rates again.\n\nUniversity of NSW economics professor Richard Holden believes the RBA has chickened out and prematurely stopped raising rates, and will ultimately need to lift the cash rate above 4 per cent to reduce inflation.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just smoothly ski down from the peak of inflation,\u201d Holden says. \u201cThe longer it takes, the more painful it is because it erodes people\u2019s income and savings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe admits that Australia may be somewhat different to the US, because of a relatively lower \u2013 although still very large \u2013 fiscal stimulus (of about 15 per cent of GDP) compared with the US (25 per cent) during the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThere is reason to believe we are a bit different to the US, but I don\u2019t think our cash rate is going to land at 3-point-something.\u201d\n\nPush-pull factors\n\nLowe says there are factors pulling in different directions.\n\nOn the positive side of the ledger, unemployment is low and the additional $300 billion of savings people accumulated during the pandemic equals about 20 per cent of annual aggregate household income.\n\n\u201cIt is also unclear how those who have built up additional savings will use them: will they treat them as wealth to be spent slowly over time or as funds that can be used to support spending this year and next?\u201d Lowe says.\n\nOn the downside, cost-of-living pressures are squeezing budgets, falling house prices have reduced wealth and the 35 per cent of households with a mortgage have experienced a significant rise in required payments.\n\n\u201cIt is increasingly clear that the higher interest rates are having an impact on aggregate household spending,\u201d Lowe says.\n\nHe is hoping that Australia can continue to avoid a self-defeating wage breakout that has pushed inflation and interest rates higher in the US.\n\nMore subdued wage growth is one of the reasons Australia has avoided the double-digit inflation rates recorded overseas. The wage price index grew at a relatively healthy 3.3 per cent last year, inside the 4 per cent limit Lowe has identified as sustainable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOne factor that has allowed the RBA to pause is that although inflation is high, it has not yet fed through to uncomfortably high wages growth,\u201d Bloxham says.\n\nBut unions are pushing for a wage increase of about 7 per cent to match inflation for more than 20 per cent of the economy\u2019s workforce.\n\nGoldman Sachs economist Andrew Boak expects the RBA to wait for the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision on minimum and award wages in June, before resuming rate increases in July and August to take the terminal cash rate to 4.1 per cent.\n\nThe RBA will also be able to assess the roll-off of many fixed-rate mortgages over the June quarter, Boak says. \u201cBy this time, the RBA will have a better read on inflation momentum over the June quarter and the Fair Work Commission\u2019s decision on minimum and award wages growth,\u201d he says.\n\nA key question the central bank is grappling with is whether Australia is different on wages, or if pay pressures could just arise later, because of the lags in pay increases from the multi-year enterprise bargaining system.\n\nReturn of the worker\n\n\u201cAt the aggregate level, wages growth is still consistent with the inflation target, provided that productivity growth picks up,\u201d Lowe says.\n\n\u201cThe board remains alert to the risk of a prices-wages spiral, given the limited spare capacity in the economy and the historically low rate of unemployment.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, it will continue to pay close attention to both the evolution of labour costs and the price-setting behaviour of firms.\u201d\n\nA relief valve for business is proving to be the return of about 400,000 extra migrants a year, injecting more workers into the labour market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe labour market remains tight with a near-50-year low unemployment rate of 3.5 per cent. But businesses report that labour shortages are easing. Job ads and vacancies have moderated from very high levels.\n\nOn the other hand, the return of strong migrant flows is contributing to a surprising recovery in house prices.\n\nReal estate analyst Geoff Lucas says \u201crecord immigration played a contributing role in the increase in property prices\u201d in the past two months.\n\n\u201cRecent CoreLogic data highlights positive consumer sentiment translating into property price hikes of 1.4 per cent in Sydney and 0.6 per cent across Australia respectively,\u201d says Lucas, chief executive of The Agency Group and a former CEO of McGrath Real Estate.\n\n\u201cWe expect further sentiment improvement in coming weeks as borrowers now feel we are at the end of the current tightening cycle.\n\n\u201cWe remain cautious, as there are many factors that suggest inflation is stickier than some of the wishful thinking suggests, and while there is an expectation of interest rate cuts into 2024, it is possible the next move may be upward if inflation proves more resilient than many would hope.\u201d\n\nMoney markets are betting that interest rate increases have probably ended, and that rate cuts could begin late this year or early next year.\n\nBut as Westpac chief executive Peter King told The Australian Financial Review Banking Summit, the most important issue is less about how high rates peak and more about how long they stay elevated."}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "Levy review: Abrdn among advisers in push for Michelle Levy reforms", "text": "\u201cThese technologies are predominantly Australian-developed and Australian-owned ...

Investment grade bonds are delivering around 6 per cent.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Australia, the number of property buyers paying down their mortgages has reached highs previously recorded during the fallout from the global financial crisis.\n\n\u201cMany borrowers topped up mortgage repayments during COVID-19 because there was not much else to do with their savings,\u201d says Kate Hill, a buyers\u2019 agency at Sydney-based Adviseable.\n\n\u201cThis trend is continuing because of rising rates. They are maintaining their higher repayments and have made significant inroads into capital .\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWays to boost retirement savings\n\nThose with a long-term view who are prepared to make the financial sacrifice to pay down their mortgage early have a number of options to boost their super.\n\nRainmaker\u2019s Dunnin illustrates the result of reducing a 30-year term by five years and investing what would have been the regular monthly mortgage repayments into a balanced fund.\n\nHe says a $1 million property buyer with a 30-year, 6.2 per cent standard variable mortgage would knock five-and-a-half years off the term and save around $405,000 by increasing repayments by $500 a month.\n\nThen, putting regular monthly payments of around $6600 a month into a balanced investment super fund would accumulate $474,000 in 60 months. This is based on the 30-year net average 7 per cent return. The cumulative payments would earn around $78,000 over the five years.\n\nAnother financial incentive for using mortgage savings to top up super is that contributions are taxed at a maximum rate of 15 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut there are also contribution caps that limit annual concessional contributions to $27,500. Unused concessional contributions carry forward on a rolling basis for five years for workers with less than $500,000 in super.\n\nLook outside super\n\nTax-effective structures outside super, such as investment bonds, also provide a range of investment options, ranging from equity funds to bonds and specialist sectors such as small companies and indices.\n\nInvestment earnings are taxed within the fund, like superannuation, but at a maximum rate of 30 per cent. After 10 years, the balance can be withdrawn tax-free.\n\n\u201cUnlike super, investment bond funds are not locked into preservation age or retirement, which means funds can be withdrawn at any time,\u201d says Grant Hackett, chief executive of Generation Life.\n\nGreg Bird, Australian Unity\u2019s head of strategy and distribution for life and super, adds an investor can control the timing of earnings withdrawals within the first 10 years to tally with a lower income year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWatch the small print\n\nTerms and conditions for repaying a mortgage early depend upon whether it is a fixed or variable rate and the availability of an offset account or redraw facility.\n\nFor example, CommBank borrowers with a fixed rate home loan can make additional repayments of up to $10,000 for each year of their fixed loan without an administrative fee or early repayment adjustment, which is a fee to cover any bank losses.\n\nConditions vary between lenders so borrowers are advised to check or seek assistance from a mortgage broker.\n\nOther ways to reduce your home loan\n\nScott Girdlestone, a director of consultancy William Buck, says an offset account allows a borrower to reduce the interest charged on a standard variable rate or investment home loan while having access to the cash when required.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt makes a loan much more manageable. Liquidity is essential to every household, especially during periods of economic slowdown and the prospect of rising unemployment\u201d he adds.\n\nIt works like a transaction account in that the borrower can make deposits or withdrawals at any time, but it\u2019s linked to a home loan. The money in account \u201coffsets\u201d the balance of the loan, reducing interest paid each month.\n\nAlternatively, a redraw facility, while different from an offset account, can also help save on a home loan.\n\nAdditional repayments on the loan above the minimum required can be accessed. But the amounts in redraw will reduce so that by the end of the agreed term the loan balance and available redraw will be zero.\n\nBorrowers using the facilities need to check small-print restrictions and conditions that can blow out a loan\u2019s total cost and duration. Some smaller lenders charge up to $100 per withdrawal, while others have minimum withdrawal amounts\n\nLenders providing most variable-rate mortgages provide redraw facilities but not all have full offset accounts.\n\nMichael Baumann, Commbank executive general manager home buying, says: \u201cAdditional lump sum payments, especially during the early years of a home loan, can have a profound effect on how much total home repayments will be and the length of time to own a property outright.\u201d"}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "The three rules that make Australia\u2019s banks the strongest in the world", "text": "\u201cCould the failure of a mid-size Californian bank specialising in servicing the fintech and start-up sectors impact the stability of the banking system in Australia 12,000 kilometres away?\u201d he wondered.\n\nMessage of reassurance\n\nThings have moved so fast over the past fortnight that the speech Lonsdale had drafted in early March was shredded and replaced with words of reassurance \u2013 but not complacency.\n\nThe core message? The hard work undertaken since the financial system inquiry to build \u201cunquestionably strong\u201d levels of equity capital will hold the Australian banking system in good stead. Depositors should be very confident that Australia\u2019s banks \u2013 big and small \u2013 have buffers to allow lenders to withstand the turbulence that is set to continue.\n\nWhile this week was relatively calmer, attention is swinging back to other regional US banks who have high levels of exposure to risky commercial property. As interest rates rise aggressively to curb inflation, schisms in US banking regulation are appearing and some lenders remain vulnerable.\n\nAs Commonwealth Bank chief executive Matt Comyn told the summit after Lonsdale\u2019s address: \u201cThe market is hunting at the moment for the banks that look a bit weaker, either from a capital or from an earnings perspective and the ability to generate capital to pay dividends.\u201d\n\nCBA CEO Matt Comyn (right) explained bank capital strength to Chanticleer columnist James Thomson at the Summit. Peter Rae\n\nComyn has also been talking to senior members of the government over the past few weeks. Indeed, just hours before the Summit started on Tuesday, Chalmers texted Comyn on his mobile phone, asking if he was available to talk. The CBA boss called him straight back.\n\nThe treasurer was keen for an early morning update on how Comyn was reading the markets. Chalmers fed back intelligence from his discussions that morning with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and, late on Monday night, president of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde.\n\nAfter convening another meeting of the Council of Financial Regulators on Thursday, Chalmers explained his latest thinking in the Financial Review on Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe world is now in the grips of an inflation shock with the risk of a hard landing brought about by the blunt and brutal tightening of monetary policy,\u201d Chalmers wrote. \u201cBut the lessons from 2008 about building resilience in our financial markets could prove vital in safeguarding our economy from the worst of the volatility impacting international markets currently.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Australian banks are the best capitalised major financial institutions in the world, Morgan Stanley noted this week: the big four are ranked in the top four places based on common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratios on the broker\u2019s tally of world\u2019s best capitalised banks. Lonsdale also presented to the event the results of the most recent bank stress testing, which confirmed their capital buffers are solid enough to withstand an economic catastrophe.\n\nNevertheless, while capital and liquidity buffers are vital, the failure of Credit Suisse showed a major bank can topple when the market loses faith \u2013 even if capital is strong. Indeed, only nine months ago, a US Federal Reserve stress test of European lenders found Credit Suisse was third-strongest out of 33 tested for capital resilience.\n\nSo Lonsdale and Comyn engaged this week in an exercise to manage confidence. Like the Reserve Bank\u2019s subtle signals about its thinking on inflation can move the price of interest rates in the bond market, Lonsdale\u2019s comments were designed to reassure depositors beyond the headline messages of resilience.\n\nAustralia has built \u201ca regulatory system for banking that has different and often tougher standards and requirements than many peer jurisdictions\u201d, Lonsdale said. \u201cWe might be connected, but their issues and problems are not necessarily ours.\u201d\n\nThree key rules\n\nHe set out how Australia had gone beyond the Basel III global banking regulatory requirements in several important areas. These include demanding higher levels of capital reflecting Australian banks\u2019 concentration risk in residential mortgage lending.\n\nUnlike the regional banks in the US, whose books are more orientated to business loans, smaller banks in Australia mostly lend for housing; in the customer-owned mutual bank sector, for example, 75 per cent of lending is for mortgages. While home loans are not without risk, they are considered safer than corporate exposures.\n\nRegulators worried that Silicon Valley Bank could cause global contagion, like the Butterfly Effect. AP\n\nAustralia also has a narrower range of \u201chigh-quality liquid assets\u201d (HQLA) when determining the \u201cliquidity coverage ratio\u201d (LCR), which ensures banks can manage 30 days of higher-than-usual deposit outflows. Removing corporate bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) \u2013 which can\u2019t always be sold easily \u2013 from the calculation strengthens the quality of bank liquidity, he explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFurthermore, these bonds are valued at market prices and are fully hedged \u2013 which should see local banks avoid the fate of SVB, which was forced to sell bonds at a loss (their price fell as interest rates rose) to meet growing redemptions.\n\nAnd then there is the extra capital to protect depositors from \u201cinterest rate risk in the banking book\u201d (IRRBB). Australia is the only jurisdiction in the world that mandates large banks carry capital to address the risk of rising interest rates as part of their core capital requirements.\n\n\u201cThe significance of this measure in light of current events is hard to overstate,\u201d Lonsdale continued. \u201cSVB\u2019s exposure to rising interest rates was one of the main factors behind its collapse. In contrast, as markets moved in response to RBA changes in the official cash rate, Australian banks have had to hold additional capital.\n\n\u201cSome banks had expressed displeasure about the application of capital for IRRBB. But two weeks ago, the IRRBB requirement proved its worth.\u201d\n\nApart from the IRRBB rules, in Australia the bank capital and liquidity rules are applied to banks of all sizes, unlike US regional banks, who successfully argued for exemptions from the full force of regulation applying to America\u2019s largest banks.\n\nAs Comyn explained, all this extra safety comes at a price. The big banks hold $120 billion more capital above minimum global requirements, which costs between $7 billion and $11 billion every year. But the cost is worth it. \u201cI think the Australian banking system is a credit to the policy frameworks and is in an extremely strong position, I would say uniquely globally,\u201d he said.\n\nCustomers queue in the rain outside a branch of Northern Rock Building Society, in Birmingham, England, in September 2007. Customers no longer need to wait for a branch to open before withdrawing funds. AP\n\nThe relative attractiveness of Australian banks in the eyes of global investors was on display just hours after the Summit concluded, when ANZ completed two bond raisings in Europe to haul in $6 billion.\n\nInvestors said this pointed to a \u201cflight to quality\u201d, which could also make it easier for Australian banks, especially the big four, to attract deposits at times of volatility, given the implicit understanding that no government would ever let a major bank fail.\n\nNew challenges\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite all the reassurances, Lonsdale was clear to point out that regulators will continue to be challenged by the new reality that we are living in a very different era now, where app-based banking makes crises appear much faster than they used to.\n\nHe contrasted the situation at SVB with the fall of Britain\u2019s Northern Rock in 2007, which was visible by hundreds of customers queuing in the street outside branches waiting to withdraw their money. Now, the ubiquity of modern online banking means there\u2019s no need to be constrained by bank branch opening hours.\n\n\u201cEntire balances can be instantly transferred elsewhere at the click of a button 24 hours a day,\u201d he warned. \u201cInformation \u2013 and misinformation \u2013 also spread further and faster than ever before, particularly through social media.\u201d\n\nLonsdale revealed regulators are considering whether liquidity regulations might be strengthened to respond to technological innovation, and to ensure banks with a particularly high exposure to a particular industry or demographic can reduce this concentration risk.\n\nLeading banking analysts agree the biggest lesson from recent events is the speed with which sentiment about a bank\u2019s prospects can change.\n\n\u201cWe have been amazed by the speed with which the current financial crisis is playing out,\u201d says Barrenjoey analyst Jon Mott. \u201cThis originally started as a deposit/liquidity crisis at SVB, unfolding in a matter of hours. With digital banking and social media, a liquidity crisis can unfold much faster than envisaged in an era of cash, cheques and branches.\u201d\n\nLonsdale also pointed to the increasingly interconnected global economy, noting news and speculation can cross the world instantly and the banking system will always be exposed to forces beyond APRA\u2019s control.\n\n\u201cFor these reasons, we must always be mindful of not only the importance of liquidity and capital, but also confidence more broadly: in our banks, in our prudential framework, and in us as regulators.\u201d"}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u0637\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0646\u06d2 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0679\u0645\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0646\u0627\u0642\u0635 \u06c1\u06d2: \u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f\u06cc \u0648\u0632\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0627\u0631\u062c\u06c1", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0631\u06cc\u0641 \u062e\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u06cc\u0648\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0644\u0688 \u0631\u06cc\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633 \u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u062a 22 \u0645\u0627\u0631\u0686 \u062a\u06a9 \u0645\u0644\u062a\u0648\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0627\u06c1\u0648\u0631 \u06c1\u0627\u0626\u06cc\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0679 \u0646\u06d2 \u0646\u0646\u06be\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0646\u0628 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0642\u0627\u062a\u0644 \u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u062d\u0645 \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u067e\u06cc\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u06cc", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062c \u06a9\u06d2 \u067e\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u067e\u0631 \u0633\u06d2 \u06af\u0632\u0631\u062a\u06d2 \u062c\u0646\u0627\u0632\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u0686\u06cc\u0641 \u062c\u0633\u0679\u0633 \u06a9\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0679\u0633", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u0631\u0637\u0627\u0646\u06cc\u06c1 \u0627\u0648\u0631 \u06cc\u0648\u0631\u067e\u06cc \u06cc\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u06d2\u062f\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u06af\u0632\u0679 \u067e\u0631\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u062f\u0631\u0622\u0645\u062f \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u06c1\u062f\u06c1 \u0637\u06d2\u067e\u0627\u06af\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0634\u0627\u06c1\u062f \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u067e\u0631 3\u0645\u0627\u06c1 \u06a9\u06d2 \u0644\u0626\u06d2  \u067e\u0631\u0648\u06af\u0631\u0627\u0645 \u06a9\u0631\u0646\u06d2 \u067e\u0631 \u067e\u0627\u0628\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0639\u0627\u0626\u062f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u062e\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0648\u06ba \u06a9\u06d2 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u06cc \u062f\u0646 \u067e\u0631 \u062e\u0648\u0634 \u0631\u06c1\u0646\u0627 \u0633\u06cc\u06a9\u06be\u06cc\u06ba", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0631\u062a: \u063a\u0641\u0644\u062a \u06a9\u06cc \u0627\u0646\u062a\u06c1\u0627\u060c \u0627\u0633\u067e\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u0632\u062e\u0645\u06cc \u06a9\u06cc \u06a9\u0679\u06cc \u06c1\u0648\u0626\u06cc \u0679\u0627\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0648 \u06c1\u06cc \u062a\u06a9\u06cc\u06c1 \u0628\u0646\u0627 \u062f\u06cc\u0627", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u06af\u0648\u06af\u0644 \u0627\u067e\u0646\u06d2 \u0645\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u0645\u06cc\u06ba \u06a9\u0646 \u062e\u0635\u0648\u0635\u06cc\u0627\u062a \u06a9\u0648 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u06cc\u062d \u062f\u06cc\u062a\u0627 \u06c1\u06d2\u061f", "text": ""}, {"source": "ary-news", "title": "\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0646 \u06a9\u0627 \u0645\u0646\u0641\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0631\u06cc\u0646 \u06c1\u0648\u0679\u0644\u060c \u06a9\u0631\u0627\u06cc\u06c1 \u0635\u0631\u0641 35 \u0688\u0627\u0644\u0631", "text": ""}, {"source": "ansa", "title": "Papa, non restiamo impotenti di fronte al male e guerre - Ultima Ora", "text": "(ANSA) - CITT\u00c0 DEL VATICANO, 08 APR - A volte l'uomo si sente \"impotente\" e \"paralizzato\" di fronte al male, alle guerre, alla corruzione.

Av disse skal omtrent 20 av sakene dreie seg om spesialtrente soldater i h\u00e6rens spesialstyrker, ogs\u00e5 kjent som KSK. Det er en andel som er fem ganger s\u00e5 h\u00f8y som i andre deler av den tyske h\u00e6ren.\n\nProfessor i internasjonal politikk p\u00e5 Universitet i M\u00fcnchen, Dr. Carlos Masala, sier saken om sersjanten har bidratt til en sv\u00e6rt viktig debatt om holdninger innad i det tyske milit\u00e6ret.\n\n\u2013 Ser man p\u00e5 antall saker sammenlignet med antallet soldater i styrken, er det uten tvil problemer med h\u00f8yreekstremisme i spesialstyrkene. Dette er snakk om sv\u00e6rt godt trente elitesoldater, s\u00e5 det er alarmerende, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-ledelsen har f\u00e5tt beskjed fra tyske myndigheter om at store endringer m\u00e5 gjennomf\u00f8res innen oktober.\n\nOppl\u00f8ste en del av spesialstyrkene\n\nI kj\u00f8lvannet av politiaksjonen mot sersjanten ble det satt ned en komit\u00e9 som skulle unders\u00f8ke utbredelsen av h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger i KSK. Funnene til komiteen f\u00f8rte til at Tysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, i forrige uke ga ledelsen i KSK klar beskjed: Rydd opp i egne rekker innen oktober.\n\n\u2013 KSK kan ikke fortsette i sin n\u00e5v\u00e6rende form, sa Kramp-Karrenbauer p\u00e5 en pressekonferanse.\n\nHun beskrev kulturen i spesialstyrkene som \u00abusunn elitisme\u00bb og med \u00abgiftig lederskap\u00bb, if\u00f8lge BBC.\n\nSpesialstyrkene f\u00e5r ikke dra p\u00e5 internasjonale oppdrag f\u00f8r b\u00e5de rekrutteringen, treningen og ledelsesmetodene har f\u00e5tt en overhaling.\n\nI tillegg kunngjorde forsvarsministeren en reform med drastiske tiltak. Blant annet fjernes en av KSKs fire enheter. Der hadde h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger f\u00e5tt s\u00e5 kraftig fotfeste at det eneste man kunne gj\u00f8re var \u00e5 legge den ned.\n\nTysklands forsvarsminister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, er fast bestemt p\u00e5 \u00e5 f\u00e5 has p\u00e5 h\u00f8yreekstreme holdninger innad i landets milit\u00e6rstyrker.\n\nFakta KSK Tysklands elitestyrke med spesialtrente soldater har siden 1996 v\u00e6rt en del av den tyske h\u00e6ren, Bundeswehr. Styrkene fokuserer p\u00e5 operasjoner i forbindelse med antiterror og gisseltagning i farlige omr\u00e5der. Styrkene har blant annet blitt sendt til Afghanistan og Balkan. Operasjonene blir hemmeligholdt. Vis mer\n\nKan v\u00e6re kroken p\u00e5 d\u00f8ren om det ikke gj\u00f8res endringer\n\nDet ble ogs\u00e5 rapportert at spesialstyrkene ikke kunne gj\u00f8re rede for hvor hele 62 kilo med eksplosiver og 48.000 patroner hadde blitt av. Dette var spesielt alarmerende med tanke p\u00e5 funnet i hagen til sersjanten, uttalte Kramp-Karrenbauer. Hun krever n\u00e5 at spesialstyrkene finner ut hvor resten av arsenalet er blitt av.\n\nProfessor Masala tror det kan bli kroken for d\u00f8ren for KSK om man ikke ser konkrete endringer de neste m\u00e5nedene.\n\n\u2013 Vi har en forsvarsminister som er sv\u00e6rt dedikert til saken og \u00f8nsker \u00e5 komme roten av problemet til livs. Hun mener alvor. Jeg tror derfor det vil komme store endringer i styrkene. KSK-ledelsen har ikke noe valg, sier Masala.\n\nKSK-soldat sendte brev om \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb i egen avdeling\n\nAnklager om ekstremisme innad i landets elitestyrke fikk oppmerksomhet allerede i 2017. Da skal flere KSK-soldater ha saluttert med \u00abHitler-hilsen\u00bb og spilt nynazistisk rockemusikk p\u00e5 en avskjedsfest for en av sjefene.\n\nS\u00e5 sent som i juni sendte en ung KSK-soldat brev til forsvarsministeren hvor han innstendig ba henne sette i gang en etterforskning av sin egen avdeling. Han beskrev en \u00abgiftig kultur av aksept\u00bb og \u00abfryktkultur\u00bb,. Ekstreme holdninger blant hans medsoldater ble ignorert, og tidvis, akseptert, if\u00f8lge soldaten, skriver New York Times.\n\nDe tyske spesialstyrkene har i lang tid f\u00e5tt operere frittst\u00e5ende, utenfor resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Det har f\u00f8rt til en form for elitisme, mener eksperter.\n\nElitisme og d\u00e5rlig lederskap preger milj\u00f8et\n\nProfessor Masala mener lojalitet og feilsl\u00e5tt lederskap gj\u00f8r at ekstreme holdninger kan f\u00e5 vokse frem i en tropp med hovedoppgave \u00e5 takle Tysklands farligste oppdrag.\n\n\u2013 Disse spesialstyrkene lever i store perioder helt avsk\u00e5ret fra omverdenen. N\u00e5r man er p\u00e5 hemmelige, livsfarlige oppdrag sammen, er du er n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 kunne stole fullt og helt p\u00e5 sidemannen. Det skaper et helt spesielt b\u00e5nd og lojalitet til hverandre. Det blir en slags milit\u00e6r kult. Da tyster man ikke p\u00e5 hverandre, sier Masala.\n\n\u2013 Du har ogs\u00e5 KSK-ledere som mener milit\u00e6ret og opptrening skal v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt aggressiv og maskulin. I tillegg har KSK frem til n\u00e5 f\u00e5tt operere ganske frittst\u00e5ende fra resten av det tyske milit\u00e6ret. Da utvikler det seg en holdning om at man er mer spesiell enn andre. Mange av soldatene blir i styrken i 15\u201320 \u00e5r, s\u00e5 man f\u00e5r f\u00e5 impulser utenfra, fortsetter professoren.\n\nDet har ogs\u00e5 blitt spekulert i om fremveksten av det h\u00f8yreorienterte partiet Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) p\u00e5 den politiske arenaen, kan linkes til h\u00f8yreekstremisme innad i forsvarsrekkene. I enkelte delstater f\u00e5r det kontroversielle partiet godt over 20 prosent oppslutning.\n\nMasala mener man forel\u00f8pig skal v\u00e6re forsiktig med \u00e5 bruke AfD som en forklarende faktor.\n\n\u2013 Jeg tror hovedproblemet f\u00f8rst og fremst ligger i strukturen til KSK.
