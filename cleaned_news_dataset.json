[{"source": "abc-news", "title": "Seattle law grants most gig workers paid sick leave", "text": "Seattle marks first city to permanently protect the benefits for gig workers.  Seattle will provide paid sick and safe leave for most gig workers under a new law, becoming the first U.S. city to guarantee such benefits on a permanent basis for app-based employees.  Workers who perform tasks for companies like Instacart, Postmates and DoorDash will accrue a day of paid sick leave for every 30 days they do work in Seattle. While on leave, workers will receive pay based on their average daily compensation.  The law permanently enshrines a temporary measure that mandated paid sick and safe leave for some food delivery workers in Seattle during the pandemic, when many customers stuck at home came to depend on delivery services. That measure was set to expire on May 1.   A healthy workforce leads to a healthy community, and no one should have to choose between taking a sick day to care for themselves -- or their families -- and making rent,  Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement.   Gig workers stepped up to serve our city during the pandemic and are an essential part of our workforce and economy, and this important legislation ensures the rights of our app-based workers remain protected,  Harrell added.  The new law expands the type of workers covered from food delivery employees to those working for a slew of apps covering a range of  on-demand  tasks. Gig workers who set their own pay will not be covered.  App-based drivers for Uber and Lyft are already guaranteed paid sick days under state law, according to a press release from the mayor's office.  Workers protected by the law will be allowed to take time off to care for their own health or that of a loved one, go to a doctor's appointment or pick up a child in the event of a school closure, among other activities, the mayor's office said.  The legislation marks the latest advance for gig workers as some city, state and federal officials push for some app-based workers to either be classified as employees or receive benefits akin to those that companies must offer part-time or full-time staff.

Instacart is committed to providing shoppers what they need to earn on their terms, and we continue to make shopper health and safety a top priority,  the company said.  Instacart is willing to work with any policymaker that prioritizes the health and safety of shoppers who choose to earn income through our platform.    However, at a time of high inflation and tightening household budgets, it is critical that policymakers also take into account the rising financial burden their misguided policy proposals could have on their constituents,  the company added.  In 2022, the Biden administration proposed a rule change that would make it easier for gig workers to be classified as employees, giving them access to minimum wage protections and other benefits.  Meanwhile, over the past five years, legislators in nine states have proposed laws that would guarantee portable benefits for gig workers that would travel with them from one app-based company to the next, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  At the outset of 2020, California implemented a measure called Assembly Bill 5, which eased the standards used for classifying gig workers as full-time employees, affecting at least one million workers.  Months later, a state referendum approved by California voters excluded Uber and Lyft workers from the new standards, returning them to the category of independent contractors.  In Seattle, gig worker advocates celebrated the new legislation guaranteeing paid sick and safe days.   The gig economy is booming thanks to workers,  Danielle Alvarado, the executive director of the nonprofit Working Washington, said in a statement.   We are proud that Seattle has recognized the importance of making sure gig workers can stay home when they are sick or need to take care of a loved one,  Alvarado added.  When gig workers are protected, we all are.

Mortgage buyer Freddie Mac reported Thursday that the average on the benchmark 30-year rate fell for the third straight week, to 6.32%, from 6.42% last week. The average rate a year ago was 4.67%.  The recent decline in mortgage rates is good news for prospective homebuyers, as many were pushed to the sidelines during the past year as the Federal Reserve cranked up its main borrowing rate nine straight times in a bid to bring down stubborn, four-decade high inflation.  Also helping buyers, home prices appear to be leveling off. The national median home price slipped 0.2% from February last year to $363,000, marking the first annual decline in 13 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.  One thing that hasn't gotten much better is the supply of homes.   Over the last several weeks, declining rates have brought borrowers back to the market but, as the spring homebuying season gets underway, low inventory remains a key challenge for prospective buyers,  said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist.  The average long-term mortgage rate hit 7.08% in the fall -- a two-decade high.  Rising borrowing costs can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for homebuyers and put the brakes on the housing market. Before surging 14.5% in February, sales of existing homes had fallen for 12 straight months to the slowest pace in more than a dozen years.  In 2022, existing U.S. home sales fell 17.8% from 2021, the weakest year for home sales since 2014 and the biggest annual decline since the housing crisis began in 2008, the National Association of Realtors reported earlier this year.  In their latest quarterly economic projections, Fed policymakers forecast that they expect to raise that key rate just once more -- from its new level of about 4.9% to 5.1%, the same peak they had projected in December.  While the Fed's rate hikes do impact borrowing rates across the board for businesses and families, rates on 30-year mortgages usually track the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing loans. Investor expectations for future inflation, global demand for U.S. Treasurys and what the Federal Reserve does with interest rates can also influence the cost of borrowing for a home.  Treasury yields have fluctuated wildly since the collapse of two mid-size U.S. banks two weeks ago. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, was 3.57% Thursday, but had been above 4% early in March.  The rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with those refinancing their homes, fell this week to 5.56% from 5.68% last week. It was 3.83% one year ago."}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "Roku to slash 200 jobs, amounting to 6% of workforce", "text": "The announcement matches a previous round of layoffs that slashed 200 jobs.

But consumer spending, which drives most of the economy's growth, was revised sharply down.  The government had previously estimated that the economy expanded at a 2.7% annual rate last quarter.  The rise in the gross domestic product -- the economy's total output of goods and services -- for the October-December quarter was down from the 3.2% growth rate from July through September. For all of 2022, the U.S. economy expanded 2.1%, down significantly from a robust 5.9% in 2021.  The report suggested that the economy was losing momentum at the end of 2022.  Consumer spending rose at a 1% annual rate last quarter, downgraded from a 1.4% increase in the government's previous estimate. It was the weakest quarterly gain in consumer spending since COVID-19 slammed the economy in the spring of 2020. Spending on physical goods, like appliances and furniture, which had initially surged as the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession, fell for a fourth straight quarter.  More than half of last quarter's growth came from businesses restocking their inventories, not an indication of underlying economic strength.  Most economists say they think growth is slowing sharply in the current January-March quarter, in part because the Federal Reserve has steadily raised interest rates in its drive to curb inflation.  The resulting surge in borrowing costs has walloped the housing industry and made it more expensive for consumers and businesses to spend and invest in major purchases. As a consequence, the economy is widely expected to slide into a recession later this year.  The central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate nine times over the past year. The Fed's policymakers are betting that they can stick a so-called soft landing -- slowing growth just enough to tame inflation without tipping the world's biggest economy into recession.  Yet as higher loan costs spread through the economy, analysts are generally skeptical that the United States can avoid a downturn. The main point of debate is whether a recession will prove mild, with only minor damage to hiring and growth, or severe, with waves of layoffs.  The financial conditions that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on March 10 and Signature Bank two days later -- the second- and third-biggest bank failures in U.S. history -- are also expected to slow the economy. Banks are likely to impose stricter conditions on loans, which help fuel economic growth, to conserve cash to meet withdrawals from jittery depositors.   The economy ended 2022 with marginally less momentum,'' Oren Klachkin and Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics wrote in a research note.  Looking ahead, the economy will face the full brunt of tighter credit conditions and Fed policy this year, and inflation is set to stay above its historical trend.   They added:  We expect a recession to hit in the second half of 2023.''  In the meantime, the job market remains robust and has exerted upward pressure on wages, which feed into inflation. The pace of hiring is still healthy, and the unemployment rate is near a half-century low. The confidence and spending of consumers remain relatively solid.  Thursday's report from the Commerce Department was its third and final estimate of GDP for the fourth quarter of 2022. On April 27, the department will issue its initial estimate of growth in the current first quarter.

Bolsonaro, who is the subject of several investigations that could stymie any attempts at a political comeback, arrived in a capital under tight security. Authorities sought to avoid any repeat of Jan. 8 events when supporters who didn't accept his defeat stormed government buildings. Police in Brasilia blocked the main artery to those buildings.  Hundreds of supporters dressed in Brazil's national colors of yellow and green chanted for Bolsonaro as they awaited his arrival, but his return did not draw the huge crowds many of his allies had expected. That appeared to please his opponents; current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's minister of institutional relations, Alexandre Padilha, called the reception a  flop.   The former president said in his first speech after touching down that his leftist successor and his allies  will not do whatever they want to the fate of our nation,  and added that the left will only keep power  for now, for a little while.   Speaking in front of a banner that read  today Brazil woke up stronger,  Bolsonaro said he would spend as much time as necessary at the headquarters of his Liberal Party to help the campaign for next year's municipal races when the country elects 5,500 mayors nationwide.  Bolsonaro left Brazil just before the end of his presidential term. In so doing, he broke with tradition by declining to hand the presidential sash to his successor, Lula, who won the October election with the narrowest finish since Brazil's return to democracy over three decades earlier.  While in the U.S., Bolsonaro mostly kept a low profile, although he delivered several speeches to Brazilian expats and conservatives, including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland.  The Brazilian leader said his three months in Florida had helped give him a vision for the future.  Everything we saw there is what we want to implement here. The most important thing is liberty.   For the first time in three decades, the lawmaker-turned-president does not hold elected office.   I am coming here in the position of an elder, an experienced person who will be consulted by whomever wishes. I will give opinions,  Bolsonaro said.  Carlos Melo, a political scientist at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said Bolsonaro had to return to confront his many legal problems, and to fend off rivals who might claim his role as leader of the right. But the new political landscape will pose a challenge, Melo said.   It is hard for him to lead the opposition, because his career was as an outsider,  Melo said.  Now, he isn't an outsider and he isn't president. He will have to build a new path.   The hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters who gathered at Brasilia International Airport early Thursday did not not get to see the far-right leader come out the main exit and instead gathered outside his Liberal Party's headquarters. The former president was welcomed at the airport by his son, Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, and Liberal Party chairman Valdemar da Costa Neto.   Bolsonaro was the best president we've ever had, I had never seen an administration like his,  said Marinalva Wanderley, 71, who brought five members of her family from Sao Paulo to the Liberal Party's headquarters.  I think he was in the U.S. with Donald Trump to see what is best for Brazil and the U.S. We will have a much bigger opposition (to Lula), that's for sure.   Bolsonaro's statements will make headlines and his loyal following will turn out for public appearances, but the immediate political impact for Lula's administration appears limited, Christopher Garman, managing director at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, wrote in a report.   I noticed he was more balanced today,  lawmaker Sostenes Cavalcante, coordinator of Congress' evangelical caucus and a Bolsonaro ally, said by phone.  I believe he will stay quiet and let Lula make mistakes on his own.   In next year's municipal elections, Bolsonaro is expected to throw his support behind his Liberal Party's mayoral candidates who, if victorious, can then use their stature to stump for him or his chosen standard-bearer. The party will begin setting up trips across the country for Bolsonaro and his wife, Michelle, who is coordinating party outreach to female voters.   His party understands that being away will do little to mitigate his legal woes and that he should be home to start playing the role of the leading opposition voice,  Garman wrote.  Bolsonaro is the subject of a series of investigations, including whether he incited the Jan. 8 uprising. Recent revelations by newspaper Estado de S.Paulo regarding three boxes of expensive jewelry allegedly brought to Bolsonaro from Saudi Arabia have exposed the former president to greater legal jeopardy.  In addition to probes into the diamonds, there are about a dozen investigations by Brazil's electoral courts into his actions during last year's campaign, particularly related to his unsubstantiated claims that the electronic voting system is susceptible to fraud. If Bolsonaro is found guilty in any of those cases, he would lose his political rights and be unable to run for office in the next election.  On Thursday, the former president denied any wrongdoing regarding the jewels.  I didn't hide anything,  he said.  ___  Hughes reported from Rio de Janeiro and Bridi reported from Brasilia.

China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary, and portrays the self-governing island democracy of 23 million people as the most sensitive issue in its increasingly fraught relationship with the U.S.  On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning reiterated China's furious objections to any meetings between Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. officials.   China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan,  Mao told reporters at a daily briefing.  China will continue to closely follow the situation and resolutely safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity.   China has particularly warned that a meeting between Tsai and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, would bring a strong but unspecified response.  Neither Tsai nor McCarthy has formally confirmed a meeting. Tsai is scheduled to transit in Los Angeles on April 5.  In August, Beijing responded to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan by launching missiles, deploying warships across the median line of the Taiwan Strait and simulating a blockade of the island. China also temporarily suspended dialogue with the U.S. on climate and other major issues and restricted military-to-military communication with the Pentagon.  Tsai's visit aims to show that Taiwan still has allies, despite China's military threats and attempts to isolate it diplomatically. Most recently, the Central American state of Honduras switched relations from Taiwan to China, leaving Taiwan with just 13 formal diplomatic allies. Tsai accused Beijing of using  dollar diplomacy  to poach another Taiwanese ally.  Tsai is expected to meet with the American Institute in Taiwan chair, Laura Rosenberger. AIT is the U.S. government-run nonprofit that carries out unofficial relations with Taiwan.  While the U.S. terms relations with Taiwan as unofficial, it is the island's chief source of military hardware and cooperation. U.S. law requires Washington to treat all threats to the island as matters of  grave concern,  but does not explicitly say whether the U.S. would commit troops.  Tsai arrived in New York on Wednesday and was scheduled to spend Thursday in the city, but few details of the trip were made public.  The U.S. typically foregoes any official meetings involving senior U.S. leaders in Washington for transit stops, as is the case for Tsai's visit.  The latest spike in tensions comes months after the passage of what the U.S. said was a Chinese spy balloon across the continental U.S., which heightened questions about China's intentions. China says it was a research balloon that was blown off course, but the Biden administration ordered it shot down and canceled a planned visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China.  Along with Taiwan and friction over trade, technology and human rights, China's close ties with Russia and its refusal to criticize Moscow's invasion of Ukraine have also increased tensions between Washington and Beijing.  Chinese leader Xi Jinping visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week, underscoring the warmth of the  no-limits  relationship between the two authoritarian states announced just weeks before Russia's year-old invasion.  China has provided Russia with an economic lifeline by buying the oil-rich country's resources. U.S. officials say they've seen indications Beijing is considering selling military hardware to Moscow, although they say there is no evidence that has happened yet.  Days after Xi's visit, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told The Associated Press he hopes to meet with Xi in Kyiv. China, which has put forward a peace proposal that says nothing about Russia withdrawing from Ukrainian territory it has seized, gave no immediate response about whether such a visit would take place.  Also Thursday, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Tan Kefei said Xi and Putin had reached  a number of important new points of consensus  during their Moscow meetings, laying out a  blueprint for the future of relations.    Strategic communication and practical cooperation between the two militaries have never ceased moving toward a higher level,  Tan said at a monthly briefing.  While Tan repeated China's stance that its relations with Russia do not constitute a formal alliance and were not aimed at any third parties, the two have increasingly aligned their foreign policies in a challenge to the dominance of global affairs by the U.S. and other democracies.  He also pledged regular joint air and sea patrols, exercises and training as the two countries work together to implement  global security initiatives (and) jointly safeguard international fairness and justice.   China has been steadily building up its 2 million-member armed forces -- already the world's largest standing military -- as well as latest-generation fighter jets, aircraft carriers and highly capable warships.  U.S. military officials also say China is rapidly expanding its stockpile of nuclear weapons and recent tough talk by Xi and other Chinese officials has heightened concerns over a potential attack on Taiwan or other U.S. interests."}, {"source": "abc-news", "title": "4 bankers convicted over Swiss account of longtime Putin pal", "text": "Four former bankers with the Swiss affiliate of a key Russian bank have been found guilty of failing to properly check accounts opened in the name of a Russian cellist with longtime ties to President Vladimir Putin  GENEVA -- Four former bankers with the Swiss affiliate of a key Russian bank were found guilty Thursday of failing to properly check accounts opened in the name of a Russian cellist with longtime ties to President Vladimir Putin.  The defendants were handed suspended sentences in Zurich district court that, if violated, could lead collectively to hundreds of thousands of Swiss francs in fines.  Lawyers for all the defendants immediately announced plans to appeal, according to an email from a spokesman for Gazprombank Switzerland, which is in the process of winding down its operations and wasn't itself facing charges.  The verdict follows a one-day trial on March 8 based on information about secret financial flows revealed in the Panama Papers leaks in 2016 that implicated musician and Putin's childhood friend Sergei Roldugin. It took years for prosecutors to unravel the web of money and bring the case to court.  The trial opened a rare window into allegations from the Panama Papers that a member of Putin's circle of friends helped funnel millions abroad and that financial employees may have turned a blind eye to such inflows. Putin has denied the accusations.  The former Gazprombank employees -- three Russian-born and one Swiss-born, who couldn't be named under Swiss law -- were charged with failing to adequately check whether Roldugin actually owned the assets in the accounts. He was a bank customer from 2014 to 2016.  All four defendants denied the charges, which include allegations of violating Swiss anti-money-laundering law.  In a statement, the Zurich regional prosecutors office said it welcomed the verdicts as  an important signal that due diligence obligations under money laundering law must be observed.   Both before and since Putin ordered forces into Ukraine, Western nations have imposed sanctions against oligarchs and others with close ties to his government, including Roldugin.  The U.S. Treasury Department describes Roldugin as  part of a system that manages President Putin's offshore wealth.   Documents filed when the accounts were opened listed expected transactions of 11.5 million Swiss francs ($12.2 million). The indictment didn't indicate how much may have arrived at the bank, but noted how Putin has  enormous assets managed by people close to him.   Gazprombank maintained the accounts despite  abundant  media reports about Roldugin's relationship to Putin, including that he was godfather to one of Putin's daughters, the indictment said.  The bank's documents listed Roldugin's income as 1 million Swiss francs a year, his assets at 10 million francs, and his occupation as a musician, indicating that the money flows were  in no way plausible as Roldugin's own wealth,  the indictment said. It said the way the accounts were structured indicated he was being used as  a straw man.   In 2016, when reports named Roldugin as the owner of $2 billion in offshore assets, Putin denied having any links to offshore accounts and described the Panama Papers leaks as part of Western efforts to weaken Russia.  The verdict was largely symbolic: The public prosecutor's office sought seven-month suspended prison sentences for the defendants.  For years, Switzerland has sought to clean up its reputation as a secret haven of billions in ill-gotten or laundered money, including through legislation that requires bankers to scrutinize the origin of funds associated with  politically exposed persons.

Pistorius, who was convicted of murder in Steenkamp's Valentine's Day 2013 killing, could leave the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre in Pretoria on Friday if his parole is granted, although the Department of Corrections said the process may take days to finalize if his application is successful.  Barry and June Steenkamp, the parents of Reeva, have said they oppose Pistorius' release and are allowed to address the parole board at his hearing. A submission by a victim's relatives is one of numerous factors taken into account.   He is a murderer. He should remain in jail,  Barry Steenkamp said in an interview with Britain's Daily Mail newspaper published last month on the 10th anniversary of his daughter's killing.  The Department of Corrections declined to give details on Pistorius' hearing, saying it was  an internal matter  like any other parole hearing.  According to guidelines, the board will consider the offense Pistorius was convicted of, his conduct and disciplinary record while in prison, whether he took part in educational or other training courses, his mental and physical state, whether he's likely to  relapse into crime  and the risk he poses to the public.  Of all the factors, legal expert Neo Mashele said that  generally speaking, the behavior of the offender is the most important consideration.   Pistorius' parole lawyer, Julian Knight, has previously said Pistorius has been a  model prisoner.  Knight didn't respond to requests for comment this week. Neither did a lawyer for the Steenkamps.  Pistorius, who is now 36, was ultimately convicted of murder after prosecutors appealed against an initial conviction for culpable homicide, which is comparable to manslaughter. He was eventually sentenced to 13 years and five months in prison for murder in 2017, again after a prosecution appeal against a lighter sentence.  Offenders in South Africa convicted of serious crimes must serve at least half their sentence before being considered for parole. Pistorius has done that after taking into account the time he served in jail from late 2014 while the appeals in his case were heard.  A number of options are available to the parole board: Pistorius could be released on full parole or placed on day parole, where he would be allowed to live and work in the community during the day but have to return to prison at night. He could also be placed under correctional supervision, which means he would be released but have to spend some of his time during the week at a correctional center.  Pistorius' parole could be denied, where the board usually asks the offender to reapply at a later stage.  A double-amputee runner and multiple Paralympic champion once hailed as an inspirational figure, Pistorius' murder trial and downfall captivated the world. His crime eventually led to him being sent to the Kgosi Mampuru II maximum security prison, one of South Africa's most notorious.  He was moved to the Atteridgeville prison in 2016 because that facility is better suited to disabled prisoners. Pistorius had both his lower legs amputated as a baby and walks with prosthetics.  There have been glimpses of his life in prison, with reports claiming he had at one point grown a beard, gained weight and taken up smoking and was unrecognizable from the elite athlete who competed against able-bodied runners on his carbon-fiber blades at the 2012 London Olympics.  He has spent much of his time working in an area of the prison grounds where vegetables are grown, sometimes driving a tractor. His father, Henke Pistorius, said in a 2018 interview that he was running bible classes for other inmates.  There have also been flashes of trouble. Pistorius sustained an injury in an altercation with another inmate over a public telephone in 2017. A year earlier, Pistorius received treatment for injuries to his wrists, which his family denied were a result of him harming himself.  Pistorius has been seeking parole since 2021 but a hearing that year was canceled partly because he hadn't yet met with Barry and June Steenkamp in a process known as a victim-offender dialogue. It is required in South Africa -- if victims or their family want the meeting -- before an offender can be considered for parole.  Pistorius claims he shot 29-year-old Reeva Steenkamp by mistake with his licensed 9 mm pistol because he thought she was a dangerous intruder. He met face-to-face with her father last year in a meeting which convinced Barry Steenkamp that Pistorius should not be released, he said in the Daily Mail interview.   I told Oscar directly that he had shot my daughter deliberately and he denied it,  Steenkamp said.  He stuck to his story that he thought it was an intruder. After all these years we are still waiting for him to admit he did it in anger. That is all we wanted.    If he told me the truth,  said Steenkamp,  I would have let the law take its course over his parole.

A partnership agreement, obtained exclusively by WIRED, shows not only how current site owner Hiroyuki Nishimura acquired the far-right message board but also how Japanese industry helped finance the deal.  The text of the deal shows that Nishimura invested $800,000 of his own money, plus $4.8 million from his company--using cash from a major Japanese telecommunications company. But the most surprising part of the deal came from Good Smile Company, which acquired a 30 percent share in 4chan for its $2.4 million investment.  This contract was filed by 4chan to investigators with the New York Attorney General's office, as part of that agency's now-closed investigation into the May 2022 mass shooting in Buffalo, New York. WIRED obtained the documents through a Freedom of Information Act request.  These documents for the first time confirm the opaque corporate partnership that has run 4chan since its 2015 acquisition, just as scrutiny increases on the money behind the long-running website.  That scrutiny may be weakening the resolve to keep 4chan going. According to Nishimura, Good Smile is in the process of ending its partnership with 4chan--this comes as the company's lucrative deal with The Walt Disney Company is set to be terminated.  The investigation was opened by request from Governor Kathy Hochul, who asked her attorney general to probe whether 4chan could face civil or criminal liability for  promoting, facilitating, or providing a platform to plan and promote violence.  While the New York Attorney General's office has declined to pursue criminal charges against the website and its owners, a spokesperson told WIRED that at least one other law enforcement agency is still investigating the website.  The New York attorney general is also calling for new legal tools to stop 4chan from promoting domestic terror attacks. Understanding the website's corporate structure will be necessary to hold them to any US law.  Good Smile, Bad Times  For years, Good Smile has been effective at hiding its role at 4chan. While the company may not be a household name in the United States, its Nendoroid collectable figurines are a big deal for anime enthusiasts. According to the company's website, it had nearly 4 billion yen ($27 million) in sales in 2021, mostly driven by those small figurines.  Good Smile produces licensed content for a variety of major brands, from major manga series like Attack on Titan to video games like Assassin's Creed and movies like The Matrix. But Good Smile's largest licensor is, without a doubt, Disney. The company markets dozens of toys and figurines from Disney properties, like Spider-Man, Buzz Lightyear, and Mickey Mouse.  In recent years, Good Smile has branched out into content creation, working with various animation and film studios, has opened online wholesale companies in China and elsewhere, and has even sponsored a Super GT racing team."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Pro-Russian hackers target elected US officials supporting Ukraine", "text": "Threat actors aligned with Russia and Belarus are targeting elected US officials supporting Ukraine, using attacks that attempt to compromise their email accounts, researchers from security firm Proofpoint said.

The politician made the remarks during a panel on Wednesday, according to S&P Global.  Where do your minerals come from?  Originally, the IRS tax credits offered to car buyers to incentivize them to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle were linked to the size of the car's battery. But as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the rules were changed. Now, the $7,500 tax credit is applicable to  clean vehicles  with a battery pack with a capacity of at least 7 kWh.  There are several more requirements, including final assembly in North America, but for most new EVs, the stumbling block is a requirement that battery components be domestically sourced.  From this year, $3,750 of the credit is tied to a requirement that at least 40 percent of the battery pack's critical minerals have to be extracted or processed in the US or a country that has a free trade agreement with the US; each year, the percentage increases by 10 percent until 2027, when 80 percent of the pack's critical minerals must be domestically sourced.  This was at the behest of Sen. Manchin--a well-known opponent of electric car incentives--and was opposed by the auto industry on the grounds that the US has very little current capacity to mine, refine, or otherwise process the minerals used in lithium-ion batteries.  Advertisement  When the new rules went into effect at the beginning of this year, the US Treasury Department said that it would not enforce the domestic battery content regulations until it had prepared guidance--that document is expected on March 31. In the interim, as long as the other requirements of the clean vehicle credit were met, those vehicles have been eligible for the full $7,500 tax credit.  Sen. Manchin has not been pleased by the IRS's permissive attitude toward EV adoption. In January, he introduced a bill to force the IRS to implement all the rules immediately, but that proposed legislation only has a single cosponsor and appears unlikely to gather much more support.  Without his fellow legislators on board, the coal millionaire says he will turn to the courts.  I'll do whatever I can,  said Manchin.  If that means going to court and I can do it, I'll do it. I don't know if I can or not, but I'll do it if I'm allowed to.   Wafers or raw powder?  Manchin's issue appears to center on what  processing  means.   Does it mean basically the processing of the raw product into a form that we can take and put in manufacturing, or is it basically the making the powders and the wafers and everything that we need... and calling that processing?  Manchin said.   You do that, and we don't meet our objective of being self-reliant... I'm willing to go to court, I'm willing to stop it all. Because that's not the intent,  he said.  Manchin's objections to foreign-sourced battery minerals aren't absolute, however.  I don't have a problem opening up to our reliable trading partners,  Manchin said.  France, the UK, the EU--I'm fine with processing in those areas. I'm just not fine with [those countries] completing the project and all we're going to do is end up assembling in the US. That is not the bill, that's not how we wrote it, and it's not how it should be implemented,  he said.

It was also said that if you hit a button hard enough, you could knock out your opponent with one hit! Certain people were supposedly seen climbing on and jumping up and down on the buttons of the machine in the hope of making a killing strike.  As a child of the '80s who loved video games, this game intrigued me.  I soon discovered that the game was called Street Fighter (SF1), and it was made by a company called Capcom. In my local arcade, it consisted of a large, curvy cabinet with two sets of controls to accommodate two players at once. Each player had a start button, an eight-way joystick, and two large pressure-sensitive rubber buttons. This cabinet is now often called the  deluxe  or  crescent  cab, and the pressure-sensitive buttons are often called  bash pads  or  pneumatic buttons.  It looked totally rad.  I recall that the controls were surprisingly stiff. Although the large pneumatic buttons looked soft, they were actually firm, and their outputs were inconsistent. And try as I might to make a super-strong killing strike, I couldn't do it. In many ways, the game was painful to play. Maybe there was too much hype from the rumors? Maybe I should have jumped on the cabinet? Maybe there was a better way to play it?  Because of complaints of injuries to players and the high cost of maintaining the machine, Capcom eventually recalled the old pneumatic controls and helped arcade operators convert the controls to a now-familiar six-button scheme that has become the standard for many fighting games (including the game's seminal sequel, Street Fighter II).  Regardless of the control scheme, SF1 was not very fun to play for long. The special moves were too powerful, they had strict input requirements, and they were difficult to perform consistently. Despite my best efforts, most of my games degenerated into mashing buttons while making half-circle motions with the joystick and waiting for special moves to come out. (Pro tip: The game can be beaten this way even on the hardest setting.) Advertisement The arcade game didn't keep me or a lot of other gamers interested for long, and it soon disappeared from most arcades. There was a very cool-looking and strangely named console port, Fighting Street, but a system seller it was not. Even my wealthiest and most game-obsessed friends never bothered to buy the TG-16/PC Engine CD add-on required to play the game (although I have realized as an adult how amazing this system truly is). For me and many folks, Street Fighter was just a pretty cool game that was most useful for video game trivia.  That is until Street Fighter II: The World Warrior (SF2) was released in 1991.    SF2 was amazing, and I became a huge fan of the game and its many iterations. Today, the Street Fighter franchise remains my favorite game series. Over the years, my interest in Street Fighter evolved. As a fan, I did the usual nerd stuff: joined newsgroups and forums, saw the movies and TV shows, and constructed and modded my own arcade joysticks. Eventually, I started tinkering with superguns and collecting arcade PCBs. Finally, I decided that I needed an arcade cabinet. Just one. And I knew exactly which one I wanted: the SF1 deluxe cabinet.  Overall, I knew SF1 was a mediocre game, but its deluxe cabinet was amazing. It was unique and nostalgic. It also had a large monitor and a control panel to accommodate most games I'd be interested in playing, so I began searching for an SF1 deluxe cabinet with the misguided intention of converting it into a MAME machine.  Time passed. As I searched for this cabinet, I inadvertently stepped into the arcade-collecting rabbit hole. And I fell in deep. It was fun, and working on these old games made me happy. In a way, they were time capsules, self-contained boxes full of old technology and history. I soon realized that one cabinet would not sate my curiosity. When I finally did find an SF1 deluxe cabinet, it would be the fifth cabinet I'd buy, and it was the six-button conversion. By that point, I already owned a Capcom  Big Blue  arcade cabinet, and another six-button cabinet seemed redundant. I had a solution for this little problem."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Buttons are back at Porsche as we see the 2024 Cayenne interior", "text": "Something many of us can agree on is that there are too many touchscreens in modern cars. They're distracting to use, particularly when it's for often-used things like the car's climate controls. Consider this a feel-good story then, because Porsche has shown us the interior of its next Cayenne SUV, and it seems that in Stuttgart, buttons are back on the menu. Some, at least.  An almost entirely touchscreen user interface was probably Porsche's only misstep with the otherwise-excellent Taycan. Indeed, when Audi used that car's platform to make its own electric express, the e-tron GT, it was notable that the climate control touchscreen was gone, replaced with actual buttons to make it hotter or cooler, more or less windy. There's no need to use a touchscreen to aim the air vents in an e-tron GT, either, unlike in a Taycan.  It is therefore encouraging to see that Porsche's design team is listening to feedback, because in many other ways the refreshed interior of the Cayenne incorporates a lot of Taycan-like touches.  The elegant curved main instrument display is free of a shroud or binnacle, just like in the electric Porsche. (An anti-glare coating applied to the screen's surface means it's always readable, even on a sunny day wearing sunglasses.)  The steering wheel will be familiar if you've sat in a Taycan--or a Porsche 911, for that matter. So, too, the knurled metal lever you use to engage forward or reverse, as the familiar shift lever has now retired from one more Porsche.  But the air vents are manually aimed once again, and there are physical switches to control temperature and ventilation on the center console. Hallelujah.  I asked Porsche what precipitated the change, and in the wake of the Taycan, how does it decide what controls belong on a touchscreen and what ought to have its own dedicated switch or button or knob?  Advertisement   So we have two things that are important to us. So first... we look, for example, at things that come from our heritage that were analog and that are very important to give you this brand identity. So, for example, the drive mode switch is a good example there,  explained Ivo van Hulten, Porsche's director of user experience design.  (Van Hulten prefers to use the term driver experience  because we have a big sports car heritage, we are a sports car brand, we decided to call it driver experience. Because we say for [Porsche], the driver is definitely the most important person in the car,  he said.)   There are also other things where we have customer feedback all the time. So we learn from how people operate our systems--if you want, you can, by checking [a box], give your data back to Porsche, and then we learn from that,  he told Ars.   But we also do extensive research with our customers. We do a lot of those sessions all over the world, in all markets--also in the US. So, for example, we know that also in the US, physical controls for climate control are very important.   I think maybe with the Taycan, it was very important for us to sort of liberate ourselves from the past and show then what our capabilities are with designing a full battery vehicle, which was the first one that we ever built. But maybe it was so digital that for this generation [of Cayenne], we learned that we want to add a little bit more of analog flavor again,  van Hulten said.  It's far too early for Porsche to share details about the Taycan's midlife update, but my guess is that when we see the face-lifted Porsche EV in a year or two, it might have also joined the Campaign to Bring Back Buttons."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "NASA delays flight of Boeing's Starliner again, this time for parachutes", "text": "NASA and Boeing announced Wednesday that the first crewed flight of the Starliner spacecraft will now take place no earlier than July 21. This moves the vehicle's flight, carrying NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, from the previously announced timeframe of April.  The manager of NASA's Commercial Crew program, Steve Stich, said the delay was attributable to the extra time needed to close out the pre-flight review process of Starliner and also due to traffic from other vehicles visiting the space station in June and the first half of July.   When we look at all the different pieces, most of the work will be complete in April for the flight,  Stich said during a teleconference with reporters.  But there's one area that's extending out into the May time frame, and this really has to do with the certification process for the parachute system.   Boeing has conducted more than 20 tests of its parachute system, including dropping the vehicle from different altitudes to test their deployment sequence and how the parachutes perform in different environments to simulate returning from space. Stich said there are no issues with the parachutes, which are installed on Starliner already. Mostly, it is about reviewing all the tests Boeing has done to ensure the parachutes performed as intended.   It's just a matter of going through all that data and looking at the data and making sure we're really ready to go fly safely,  Stich said.  Advertisement  There is one final test to be completed on the ground, he said, of a parachute subsystem that pulls Starliner's forward heat shield away and sets up deployment of the drogue and then main parachutes. That test is targeted for May.  The additional time needed to complete the review process of Starliner and its parachute system delayed the vehicle's launch into June. However, at that time, NASA plans to launch SpaceX's CRS-28 cargo resupply mission, which will tie up one of the lab's docking hatches. This supply mission is bringing solar arrays to the station that NASA does not want to delay because it would delay planned spacewalks to install them. The lack of a docking port, therefore, pushed the Starliner flight into the second half of July.  NASA and Boeing must also balance schedules with United Launch Alliance, which is boosting the mission to orbit with its Atlas V rocket. The company presently has the USSF-51 mission scheduled for the Space Force this summer and also needs the Space Launch Complex-41 pad for the debut of its Vulcan rocket in May or later this summer.  This will be the third flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The vehicle's debut in December 2019 failed to rendezvous with the International Space Station after multiple issues, including software problems. After fixing these issues, Boeing flew the vehicle on a second test flight in May 2022. Although there were some propulsion issues with this flight, Starliner docked with the space station, setting the stage for a crewed flight test.  After Boeing completes this critical test flight and NASA certifies the vehicle as ready for operational missions, the company will fly approximately once a year to the space station for regular crew rotations. The first of these operational missions is planned for no earlier than the spring of 2024."}, {"source": "ars-technica", "title": "Lenovo gives up on its dream of Android gaming phones", "text": "Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Lenovo  Android manufacturers occasionally try to push this idea of a  gaming smartphone --usually, these companies try to extend the  PC gamer  design motif to smartphones, with RGB LEDs and aggressive marketing.

While most passively cooled Android phones would quickly throttle in a graphics-intensive game, this was one of the rare phones with what looked like sustainable cooling. Of course, it didn't fit into a normal smartphone body--the phone's center (in landscape) was about twice as thick as normal, but it was a neat product.

It also had two USB-C ports: one in the usual location, but since that would be blocked during landscape gaming, a second port was on the side of the phone, so it would point downward during landscape gaming. You could charge from either port, but you could also charge with both ports simultaneously, which Lenovo called 90 W  ultra-fast double charging.  The included charger had two USB ports on it.  Lenovo was right to focus on cooling, because while PC gaming computers can prove their worth with premium parts, there's no such thing as  better than flagship  parts for smartphones. The Duel 2 had the same Snapdragon 888 SoC as every other flagship device, but at least it could run without throttling. The other things that exist for PC gaming and don't exist for Android are games, or at least games that would encourage buying enthusiast-grade hardware.

After substantial briefing by both sides, and an evidentiary hearing that featured witness testimony and other evidence, the Court concludes that sanctions are warranted,  US District Judge James Donato wrote. Later in the ruling, he wrote that evidence shows that  Google intended to subvert the discovery process, and that Chat evidence was 'lost with the intent to prevent its use in litigation' and 'with the intent to deprive another party of the information's use in the litigation.'   He said that chats produced by Google last month in response to a court order  provided additional evidence of highly spotty practices in response to the litigation hold notices.  For example, Donato quoted one newly produced chat in which  an employee said he or she was 'on legal hold' but that they preferred to keep chat history off.   Donato's ruling was made in a multi-district antitrust case bringing together lawsuits filed by Epic Games, the attorneys general of 38 states and the District of Columbia, the Match Group, and a class of consumers. It's being heard in US District Court for the Northern District of California. The case is over the Google Play Store app distribution model, with plaintiffs alleging that  Google illegally monopolized the Android app distribution market by engaging in exclusionary conduct, which has harmed the different plaintiff groups in various ways,  Donato noted.  Donato's ruling said that Google provided false information to the court and plaintiffs about the auto-deletion practices it uses for internal chats. Google deletes chat messages every 24 hours unless the  history-on  setting is enabled by individual document custodians. Advertisement  Judge: Google repeatedly gave false info  There are 383 Google employees who are subject to the legal hold in this case, and about 40 of those are designated as custodians. Google could have set the chat history to  on  as the default for all those employees but chose not to, the judge wrote.   Google falsely assured the Court in a case management statement in October 2020 that it had 'taken appropriate steps to preserve all evidence relevant to the issues reasonably evident in this action,' without saying a word about Chats or its decision not to pause the 24-hour default deletion,  Donato wrote.  Google did not reveal the Chat practices to plaintiffs until October 2021, many months after plaintiffs first asked about them.   The judge then chided Google at greater length:  The Court has since had to spend a substantial amount of resources to get to the truth of the matter, including several hearings, a two-day evidentiary proceeding, and countless hours reviewing voluminous briefs. All the while, Google has tried to downplay the problem and displayed a dismissive attitude ill tuned to the gravity of its conduct. Its initial defense was that it had no 'ability to change default settings for individual custodians with respect to the chat history setting,' but evidence at the hearing plainly established that this representation was not truthful. Why this situation has come to pass is a mystery. From the start of this case, Google has had every opportunity to flag the handling of Chat and air concerns about potential burden, costs, and related factors. At the very least, Google should have advised plaintiffs about its preservation and related approach early in the litigation, and engaged in a discussion with them. It chose to stay silent until compelled to speak by the filing of the Rule 37 motion and the Court's intervention. The Court has repeatedly asked Google why it never mentioned Chat until the issue became a substantial problem. It has not provided an explanation, which is worrisome, especially in light of its unlimited access to accomplished legal counsel, and its long experience with the duty of evidence preservation.  Donato said another  major concern is the intentionality manifested at every level within Google to hide at the ball with respect to Chat. As discussed, individual users were conscious of litigation risks and valued the 'off the record' functionality of Chat. Google as an enterprise had the capacity of preserving all Chat communications systemwide once litigation had commenced but elected not [to] do so, without any assessment of financial costs or other factors that might help to justify that decision.

Signed by Elon Musk and several prominent AI researchers, the letter quickly began to draw attention in the press--and some criticism on social media.  Earlier this month, OpenAI released GPT-4, an AI model that can perform compositional tasks and allegedly pass standardized tests at a human level, although those claims are still being evaluated by research. Regardless, GPT-4 and Bing Chat's advancement in capabilities over previous AI models spooked some experts who believe we are heading toward super-intelligent AI systems faster than previously expected.  Along these lines, the Future of Life Institute argues that recent advancements in AI have led to an  out-of-control race  to develop and deploy AI models that are difficult to predict or control. They believe that the lack of planning and management of these AI systems is concerning and that powerful AI systems should only be developed once their effects are well-understood and manageable.

To address these potential threats, the letter calls on AI labs to  immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.  During the pause, the authors propose that AI labs and independent experts collaborate to establish shared safety protocols for AI design and development. These protocols would be overseen by independent outside experts and should ensure that AI systems are  safe beyond a reasonable doubt.   However, it's unclear what  more powerful than GPT-4  actually means in a practical or regulatory sense. The letter does not specify a way to ensure compliance by measuring the relative power of a multimodal or large language model. In addition, OpenAI has specifically avoided publishing technical details about how GPT-4 works.  The Future of Life Institute is a nonprofit founded in 2014 by a group of scientists concerned about existential risks facing humanity, including biotechnology, nuclear weapons, and climate change. In addition, the hypothetical existential risk from AI has been a key focus for the group. According to Reuters, the organization is primarily funded by the Musk Foundation, London-based effective altruism group Founders Pledge, and Silicon Valley Community Foundation.  Notable signatories to the letter confirmed by a Reuters reporter include the aforementioned Tesla CEO Elon Musk, AI pioneers Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque, and author Yuval Noah Harari.

The United States has announced sanctions against a Slovakian man who was reportedly working to arrange a weapons sale between North Korea and Russia, as the war in Ukraine puts strain on Moscow's access to military goods.  The US Department of the Treasury said on Thursday that it was imposing sanctions on Ashot Mkrtychev as part of its effort to constrain Russia's ability to replace military equipment lost on the battlefield.   Russia has lost over 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment since the start of the war, and thanks in part to multilateral sanctions and export controls, Putin has become increasingly desperate to replace them,  said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a news release.   Schemes like the arms deal pursued by this individual show that Putin is turning to suppliers of last resort like Iran and the DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea].   Shortly after the sanctions were announced, the White House expressed concern that  North Korea will provide further support to Russia's military operations against Ukraine .   We have new information that Russia is actively seeking to acquire additional munitions from North Korea,  national security spokesperson John Kirby told reporters. Such a deal would violate United Nations Security Council resolutions, he added.  As Russia's costly invasion of Ukraine has dragged on, the US has continued efforts to isolate Russia economically and diplomatically. However, Russia has benefited from continued relations with countries around the world who see it as an important ally and trading partner.  Yellen said the US would continue to crack down on Russia's efforts to  evade sanctions and obtain military equipment  from countries like North Korea.  The news release states that Mkrtychev is a Slovakian national who negotiated with officials in Russian and North Korea to forge a relationship of  mutually beneficial cooperation .  From 2022 to early 2023, the Treasury says that Mkrtychev arranged for North Korean officials to furnish  over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions for Russia . In exchange, he worked to have commercial aircraft, raw materials and commodities delivered to North Korea.  North Korea is itself under heavy US sanctions, which can impact its ability to access various goods. The news release states that Mkrtychev's negotiations were confirmed with senior Russian officials, indicating that  preparations for a proposed deal were complete .  Thursday's sanctions freeze any US-based assets held by the person designated and generally bar people in the US from having business dealings with them."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Belarus arrests Russian separated from daughter over sketch", "text": "Moskalyov, whose child drew an anti-war picture, was sentenced to jail for discrediting the Russia army but had fled.  A Russian father, who was separated from his daughter over a Ukraine-themed school drawing, has been detained in Belarus after fleeing house arrest in Russia, Belarusian authorities said.  Alexei Moskalyov, a 54-year-old single father from the town of Yefremov south of Moscow, fled house arrest this week just before a court handed him a two-year sentence for  discrediting  the Russian army.   Moskalyov has been detained ... following a request from Russian police  and is currently being held in Belarus, a spokeswoman for the Belarusian interior ministry was cited as saying by Russian news agencies on Thursday.  Lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said Moskalyov had been arrested in the capital Minsk, most likely as a result of turning on his mobile phone and giving away his location.   Apparently someone made a mistake, maybe it was due to him using a mobile phone,  said Zakhvatov, who had been in contact with Moskalyov.  Most likely it was due to him using a mobile phone improperly,  he told the Reuters news agency.  Moskalyov first came to the authorities' attention last year after his daughter Maria, now 13, drew a picture at school showing missiles next to a Russian flag heading towards a woman and child standing by a Ukrainian flag.  Her head teacher contacted the police.  A criminal case was later opened against the father for allegedly criticising Russia's assault on Ukraine on social media.  On Tuesday, he was sentenced to two years in prison for  discrediting  the Russian army. Moskalyov was not present in the courtroom, having fled house arrest before the sentencing.  Maria was taken away from him in March and placed in a local  rehabilitation centre  for minors, with the pair denied contact.  The case has garnered national attention, as Moscow cracks down on criticism of the offensive in Ukraine.  Moskalyov's lawyer Vladimir Biliyenko has said it is now  difficult to predict  what will happen to Maria.  Moskalyov is at risk of losing parental rights in a separate trial set to begin on April 6.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has defended Moskalyov's sentencing, describing the father's parenting as  deplorable .  But in a letter published on social media Maria called her father  the bravest person in the world .  Russia's top human rights organisation Memorial, which has been outlawed by the authorities, said it considered Moskalyov a  political prisoner .

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ordered the United States to pay compensation to Iranian companies after ruling that Washington had illegally allowed courts to freeze their assets.  The United Nations' top court, also known as the World Court, did not specify the exact amount in its ruling on Thursday but said it would be determined in a later phase.  In a blow for Tehran, however, the tribunal in The Hague said it did not have jurisdiction over $1.75bn in frozen assets from Iran's central bank held in a Citibank account in New York, by far the largest amount claimed back by Tehran.  ICJ Vice-President Kirill Gevorgian said the majority  upholds the objection to jurisdiction raised by the United States of America relating to the claims of the Islamic Republic of Iran  in regard to the bank.  The case was initially brought by Tehran against Washington in 2016 for allegedly breaching a 1955 friendship treaty.  In hearings last year, the US argued the case should be dismissed because Iran has  unclean hands  and the asset seizures were the result of its alleged sponsoring of  terrorism . It added the money was to be given in compensation to victims of a 1983 bombing in Lebanon and other attacks linked to Iran.  The court on Thursday dismissed this defence entirely and ruled the treaty - signed long before Iran's 1979 revolution - was valid.  The toppling of the US-backed shah and the establishment of the new government after the revolution severed US-Iranian relations, and Washington withdrew from the treaty in 2018.  Nonetheless, the ICJ ruled that it was still in place at the time of the freezing of the assets of Iranian commercial companies and entities, and that therefore Washington violated the treaty.  According to the judges, however, the court has no jurisdiction over the $1.75bn in assets held by the US because Iran's central bank - known as the Bank Markazi - is not a commercial enterprise, and thus not protected by the treaty.  Iran said the court had demonstrated the legitimacy of its position and the  illegal  behaviour of the US.   The verdict of the International Court of Justice handed down on March 30 shows once again the legitimacy  of Iran's positions  and the illegal behaviour of the United States,  Tehran's foreign ministry said in a statement.  The US said the ruling was a  major victory.    The court's decision today rejected the vast majority of Iran's case, including notably Iran's claims on behalf of Bank Markazi,  said acting legal adviser Richard Visek of the US Department of State.   This is a major victory for the United States and victims of Iran's state-sponsored terrorism,  said Visek, who was at the reading of the verdict in The Hague.  The rulings of the ICJ are binding, but the court has no means of enforcing them. The US and Iran are among a handful of countries to have disregarded its decisions in the past."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Ukraine prepares for counterattack as Putin makes nuclear threats", "text": "Western battle tanks begin to arrive as Russian forces remain unable to break through Ukrainian defences.  Ukraine's defences have held up against dozens of daily Russian ground assaults along the eastern front during the 57th week of the Russia-Ukraine war, while promised tanks and fighter jets have arrived to arm Ukraine's expected counteroffensive.  To this gathering strength, Russian President Vladimir Putin has replied with a nuclear threat widely dismissed as evidence that he did not have an adequate conventional military response.  Bakhmut, the eastern city levelled by months of fighting, remains key.  Assaults stretched from Kupiansk in Kharkiv province to Avdiivka in southern Donetsk.  But the toughest fighting seemed to take place in Bakhmut, where geolocated footage suggested Wagner Group mercenaries made advances from March 28 to 29.  The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine said Russian forces had met  with partial success .  Footage provided by Russian newspaper Ria Novosti suggested Wagner mercenaries had captured the AZOM industrial complex within Bakhmut.  But Ukraine's defenders were not evacuating.   We are holding the Bakhmut fortress,  wrote Ukraine's commander of ground forces Colonel-General Oleksandr Syrskyi.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy explained the political and psychological rationale for fighting for Bakhmut.  If it fell, Putin would  sell this victory to the West, to his society, to China, to Iran , Zelenskyy said.   If he will feel some blood - smell that we are weak - he will push, push, push,  Zelenskyy told The Associated Press.  Syrskyi explained the military reasoning.   Our main task is to wear down the overwhelming forces of the enemy and inflict heavy losses on him. This will ... speed up our victory,  he said.  Eastern forces spokesman Serhiy Cherevaty said Wagner units were now being reinforced by regular Russian troops due to these losses.  United Kingdom military adviser Ian Stubbs told Vienna's Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that Russia had suffered huge casualties in Bakhmut.   Their assault seemingly stalled, reports suggest that the Russian military and Wagner Group urgently need to replenish personnel and munition stocks. Approximately 30,000 Russian fighters have been killed or wounded since the battle for Bakhmut began nine months ago, with the Wagner-dominated force advancing just 25km [16 miles] in this time,  Stubbs said.   Try as they might to present an alternate reality to the ground truth with an increasingly ridiculous carpet of disinformation, the astounding levels of incompetence in Russia's military leadership that have eroded Russia's military reputation are clear for all to see.   A separate Russian attempt to surround nearby Avdiivka culminated in failure.   These attacks have now become not merely pointless, but actually harmful to Russian preparations for the next phase of this war, which will revolve around the upcoming Ukrainian counter-offensive,  wrote the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, a think-tank, in its analysis.  The Ukrainian Center of National Resistance said Russia was seeking to hire 2,000 mercenaries from Belarus to replenish its dwindling numbers of experienced fighters, and had also hired 100 mercenaries from Angola.  The coming counteroffensive  In late January, Ukraine's allies promised to send offensive weapons for the first time - and these began to arrive on schedule.  Eighteen German Leopard 2A6 main battle tanks - four more than expected - arrived on March 27.   Our tanks, as promised, arrived on time to the hands of our Ukrainian friends,  German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said.  The following day, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov revealed that 14 British Challenger 2 tanks had also arrived.   These fantastic machines will soon begin their combat missions,  he said.  And the day after that, Ukraine said it had received three Leopard 2A6 tanks promised by Portugal.  This meant that of the 252 main battle tanks allies promised to Ukraine, 35 had been delivered.  The first four of 13 promised Slovak MiG-29s also landed in Ukraine on March 23.  Wagner Group chief Yevgeny Prigozhin said Ukraine was holding 200,000 troops in reserve to attack the eastern front line.   They are very afraid of our counteroffensive, as evidenced by the interception of telephone conversations,  said Ukrainian Colonel Oleksiy Dmytrashkivskyi.  Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said Russian collaborators had been warned to leave the Crimean Peninsula over FM radio on March 23, adding real estate sales suggested Russian families had already begun evacuating the peninsula.  The Ukrainian General Staff had information that Russian forces were digging trenches to strengthen defences in Crimea.  But Putin attempted to deny Ukrainian offensive capacity on Rossiya-24 television, saying the United States needed a month to replace the shells Ukraine fired in three days.  Twenty European countries have pledged to provide Ukraine with a million 155mm shells - a move Reznikov called  decisive  for the war - and France announced it was doubling the shells it was sending Ukraine to 2,000 a month as part of that pledge.  No F-16s - yet  Ukraine's demand for Western fighter jets went unanswered, however.  US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told the US Congress that he could not usefully supply F-16 fourth-generation fighters because of powerful Russian air defences and the length of time it would take the deploy the aircraft.   That won't help them in this current fight,  Austin said.  And will they have a capability at some point down the road? We all believe that they will.    The key message for us is that the United States of America is not abandoning its plans to transfer generation 4+ fighter jets, which Ukraine needs,  said Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ignat.  Yes, maybe it will take more time.   Reznikov also fought back speculation that France was to supply Ukraine with Mirage fighters.  Zelenskyy insisted on Ukraine's need for the jets and long-range weapons in a conference with European Union leaders. In their absence, he warned, the EU should prepare for a longer war.   If Europe hesitates, evil can prepare itself for years of war, it is in your power not to allow this to happen,  he tweeted.  Nuclear threats  Putin said he had delivered the nuclear-capable Iskander missile system to Belarus, and a nuclear weapons storage facility would be constructed by July 1.  This was not a new threat.  Russia has said for months that it would modify Belarusian fighter jets to carry nuclear missiles.   Putin is too predictable,  tweeted Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak.  Making a statement about tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, he admits that he is afraid of losing and all he can do is scare with tactics.   Ukraine's military intelligence spokesman Andriy Yusov said the agency hadn't seen movements of nuclear weapons.  EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell called on Belarus to refuse the weapons, calling the move an  irresponsible escalation  and a  threat to European security  that would be met with new sanctions.   Russia once again confirms its chronic inability to be a responsible possessor of nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence and prevention of war, not as a tool of threats and intimidation,  Ukraine's foreign ministry said.   I believe that despite the actual occupation of Belarus by the Russian Federation, this will not happen,  said Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defence Council of Ukraine."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Who are the Gold Mafia? A cigarette don and a man named 'Dollars'", "text": "They operate from the shadows. Al Jazeera's latest investigation, The Gold Mafia, brings their crimes out into the open. Last week, Part 1 of 'Who are the Gold Mafia?' dove into the lives of some of Southern Africa's biggest money launderers and smugglers, from pastors to diplomats.  Now, in Part 2, meet one of the region's biggest cigarette moguls, a showoff money launderer and their crafty partners who are plundering their nations of money and gold using a web of highly-placed connections, front companies and carefully doctored documents.  Simon Rudland  One of Zimbabwe's richest men, Rudland co-owns Gold Leaf Tobacco, among the largest cigarette manufacturers in South Africa. But in 2022, the South African Revenue Service accused Rudland's company of selling illicit cigarettes and avoiding taxes.  Al Jazeera's investigation shows that his web of crime extends far beyond that, to an elaborate money laundering and gold smuggling scheme that helps him hide millions of dollars of unaccounted cash.  Documents and witness statements reveal that Rudland also loans some of his money to Zimbabwe's government, which is cash-strapped because of Western sanctions. In exchange, Fidelity Printers and Refiners, the Zimbabwe central bank's refinery, lets his couriers carry millions of dollars of gold to Dubai for sale through frequent trips.  He gives Fidelity the money, to buy the gold, for him to export,  fellow Zimbabwean gold smuggler Ewan Macmillan said in secretly recorded interviews, claiming that Rudland  bankrolls the whole country .  At the centre of Rudland's money laundering operations is a company in Dubai called Aulion that buys Zimbabwean gold using his dirty cash. Macmillan claimed Rudland has access to Zimbabwe's highest-ranking officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the head of the central bank. Among Rudland's business partners are a retired general, a former sanctioned energy minister and a former minister of foreign affairs, the investigation shows.  In 2019, two men attempted to assassinate Rudland, an incident he barely survived. Rudland was shot while in his car, but the culprits were never caught.  Asked for a response to Al Jazeera's investigation, Rudland told us that the allegations against him formed part of a smear campaign by an unidentified third party. He described himself as  a strong businessman ... competing against the greedy and the envious .  He denied any involvement in the sale of illicit cigarettes, in gold or other forms of smuggling and in sanctions busting. He also denied any knowledge of Aulion and its activities and told us that it was not true that money passed from his accounts to Aulion.  He admitted to dealing with Mohamed Khan, who he agreed  appeared  to be a money launderer, and that two of Rudland's companies had authorised Khan's company to act as their agent, but denied that any form of money laundering had been undertaken for him or any of his businesses.  Gold Leaf Tobacco, his company, emphatically denied any involvement, past or present, in money laundering, the trade in illegal gold or related matters. No  untaxed  or  illegal  cigarettes could be  attributed  to Gold Leaf, though the proceeds of the illicit sale of its products by others did appear to have been moved between jurisdictions and thereby laundered.  Fidelity Printers and Refiners denied all wrongdoing.  Mohamed Khan, aka Mo Dollars  He likes flashy cars, has a weakness for women and is deadly dangerous, Khan's ex-wife Wardah Latief and brother Dawood told Al Jazeera. Khan, who is known as Mo Dollars, owns PKSA and SALT Asset Management, South African financial services firms that help Simon Rudland and others launder large sums of money through fake invoices and stolen identities.  Khan built his money-laundering empire by bribing influential people in several South African banks to either turn a blind eye or work actively with him on his schemes: Al Jazeera's I-Unit has accessed bank statements revealing how he pays them off every month.  Dawood said the brothers were poor growing up and often mocked by other children.  Khan loves to show off his newfound wealth: He travels business class, stays in the most expensive hotels in Dubai, and would get Latief all the designer clothes she wanted.  But Khan also has a much darker side. Audio recordings obtained by Al Jazeera reveal veiled threats against his own brother Dawood if he decided to turn into a witness against Mohamed and his clients.  You know what happens, right?  Khan asked Dawood's wife on a phone call.  They kill you,  she responded.  Exactly,  Khan said.  Mohamed Khan told us that all allegations against him were false and based on speculation, conjecture and manufactured and doctored evidence. Khan confirmed he owned PKSA and SALT Asset Management but denied involvement in money laundering or other criminal activity. He denied bribing anyone.  PKSA and SALT Asset Management did not respond to requests for comment sent by Al Jazeera.  Howard 'Howie' Baker  Howard 'Howie' Baker is Rudland's point person in Dubai, the investigation shows. He is the owner of several gold-trading companies, including Aulion Global Trading -- the firm at the centre of Rudland's laundering operations. The company buys the Zimbabwean gold exported by Rudland's couriers.  It also receives tens of millions of dollars from the accounts of Gold Leaf Tobacco via fake invoices created by Mo Dollars and -- earlier -- by his brother Dawood. These invoices create the illusion of tobacco imports by Gold Leaf into Zimbabwe that in reality do not exist.  According to Dawood, Baker was considered the  glue keeping everything together .  Baker, who like Rudland and Macmillan is from Zimbabwe, also is the owner of Rappa Refinery, a gold refinery in South Africa which supplies Aulion with gold, the investigation shows. He did not respond to Al Jazeera's request for a response.  Andries Greyvensteyn  Andries Greyvensteyn is a partner in Aulion Global Trading.  Together with Baker and Mo Dollars, Greyvensteyn is also the director of a South African gold dealer called Gold Kid -- whose offices serve as the headquarters of Gold Leaf's dodgy operations.  It is another company used to move gold and illicit funds. Documents obtained by Al Jazeera's I-Unit show that Gold Kid was one of the companies Mohamed Khan used to launder money.  Greyvensteyn is also the owner of a company in the United States called Liberty Gold, used by Mo Dollars to launder millions of dollars to the US using fake invoices, documents accessed by Al Jazeera show.  In response to our questions, Greyvensteyn said that he had not knowingly participated in any money laundering scheme. Liberty Gold denied all knowledge of the matters and individuals featured in this report. Gold Kid did not respond to Al Jazeera's inquiries.  The Couriers  The gold mafia consists of multiple rival gangs, and each has its own set of couriers. These relatively low-level operatives are the people who move gold and money between different countries. They mostly travel between Zimbabwe and Dubai, carrying dozens of kilos of gold and millions of dollars with them on the trips.  Documents and footage obtained by the I-Unit show couriers such as Patrick Keith, Johannes Swan Sr, Johannes Swan Jr, and Peter Bowen take these trips multiple times per month, each time carrying large amounts of gold and cash back and forth.  The couriers did not respond to our inquiries."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "Gold smugglers use South African banks, bribes to launder money", "text": "Staff at three major banks were on the payroll of 'Mo Dollars', an accomplice of gold smuggler Simon Rudland.  Several key officials at three major South African banks are helping a gold smuggling gang launder millions of dollars of dirty cash in exchange for regular bribes, an Al Jazeera investigation has found.  The officers at Standard Bank, ABSA Bank and Sasfin Bank have been on the payroll of Mohamed Khan, a money launderer working for cigarette magnate and smuggler Simon Rudland, thousands of documents and interviews with Khan's former colleagues reveal.  These officers would enable dubious money transfers from Khan's companies and remove evidence from the computer systems, all while getting monthly payments from Khan.  The revelation is part of Gold Mafia, a four-part investigation by Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit (I-Unit), which shows how multiple gangs smuggle gold from Zimbabwe and use it to launder vast amounts of money.  The documents obtained by the I-Unit include ledgers, contracts and emails showing the process Khan and Rudland used. The I-Unit also interviewed Dawood Khan, Mohamed Khan's brother who helped forge documents; another of Khan's former partners who we are calling Jimmy to protect his identity; and Khan's ex-wife Wardah Latief.  Fake identities, fraud invoices  Khan, who goes by the nickname Mo Dollars, heads PKSA and Salt Asset Management, South Africa-based financial services firms. Among their biggest clients is Zimbabwean millionaire Simon Rudland, owner of Gold Leaf Tobacco, one of Southern Africa's largest cigarette brands.  South African revenue authorities have accused Rudland of evading taxes by selling cigarettes on the black market.  The illicit cigarette trade earns rand cash. So he gets a ginormous amount of rand cash,  fellow Zimbabwean gold smuggler Ewan Macmillan told Al Jazeera's undercover reporters, who were posing as Chinese criminals looking to launder unaccounted cash.  He has the same problem in legitimising his money as you have.   Mo Dollars does this for Rudland; cleansing his dirty money using a complicated web of front companies, fake invoices, bribery and gold.  At the centre of this scheme is a set of companies with bank accounts in different parts of the world - Aulion in Dubai, Vantage Leaf in Mauritius, Velmont Valley in Switzerland and Liberty Gold in the United States.  Using fake invoices and identities, Mo Dollars transfer millions of unaccounted dollars in each transaction to these companies, which are run by Rudland's partners, the investigation shows.  PKSA and Salt Asset Management, which send the money, claim to be doing so in lieu of imports of tobacco, clothes and gold - imports that never actually enter South Africa.  It's Simon laundering that money,  said Dawood Khan, referring to Rudland.  Money that was not reported through the legitimate streams, and needed to be moved.   To  move  that money, he said, his brother Mo Dollars bribes influential officers at several South African banks so no red flags are raised during the transactions.  The bribes range from monthly payments to paid holidays and house renovations, according to Latief, Mo Dollars's ex-wife, and documents accessed by Al Jazeera.  'The most valuable jewel'  Sasfin Bank, which caters to small businesses is one of the institutions that Mo Dollars infiltrated.  Hussain Choonara, who was in charge of the bank's foreign exchange payments, was listed as receiving $1,600 per month, ledgers maintained by Mo Dollars and his aides show.  Mohamed and Hussain had a magnificent relationship,  Dawood Khan told Al Jazeera.  He would basically ensure that his staff is pushing through this work unquestioned.   He was like the most valuable jewel or component, if I can put it that way, in Sasfin, to ensure the success of the money being laundered.   Choonara would also tell Mo Dollars who else he needed to bribe at Sasfin, Dawood Khan claimed. Among them was Lulama Kene, an IT technician who ensured fraudulent transactions were wiped from the bank's digital system. Choonara left Sasfin in 2019.  Others on Mo Dollars's payroll included Cheryl Simons, who worked in the compliance office, and Brandon Marshall, the head of onboarding new business customers, the ledgers suggest. Kene and Simons were each paid $800 a month, while Marshall received $3,200 every month. Marshall and Kene have left Sasfin, and the bank suspended Simons after allegations about her role in helping Rudland launder his money first emerged.   Friday afternoons after lunch they get their money,  Latief recalled. But it wasn't just money, she said.  He also used to give them holidays overseas. And he used to renovate their houses for them.   Banking on bribery at the biggies  Mo Dollars also targeted two of South Africa's three biggest financial institutions with a similar strategy: Standard Bank and ABSA Bank.  Videsh Seeripat, a relationship manager at ABSA, is listed in the ledgers as receiving $800 a month. His job was to open bank accounts in the name of people who were not present to apply themselves, a mechanism that allowed Mo Dollars to start accounts using fake identities.   He would get the compliance people to sign it off, have another representative sign the document, and claim that all the necessary compliance boxes were ticked,  Dawood Khan said.  At Standard Bank, Africa's largest bank, Vivian Naicker, a senior manager in the compliance division, made sure Khan's companies received the documentation needed to evade the scrutiny of South Africa's central bank, Dawood said. Naicker communicated with Khan using a pseudonym, Vic Grimes, according to emails between the two.   We would then provide him with the necessary documentation. He would then, by himself, set up and complete the application,  Dawood said.  He would then submit it to the Reserve Bank, get approval, which would allow us to facilitate payments without any scrutiny, through any bank.   Asked for a response to Al Jazeera's investigation, Simon Rudland told Al Jazeera that the allegations against him formed part of a smear campaign by an unidentified third party. He described himself as  a strong businessman...competing against the greedy and the envious . He denied any involvement in the sale of illicit cigarettes, in gold or other smuggling and in sanctions busting.

Payments made to Vantage Leaf, Liberty Gold and Velmont Valley had nothing to do with Rudland or his companies, he said.  Gold Leaf said that it emphatically denied any involvement, past or present, in money laundering, the trade in illegal gold or related matters. The company said that no  untaxed  or  illegal  cigarettes could be  attributed  to Gold Leaf, though the proceeds of the illicit sale of its products by others did appear to have been moved between jurisdictions and thereby laundered.  Gold Leaf said its limited transactions with Khan and SALT had always been lawful and proper. Gold Leaf had never made any payment to Aulion, it claimed.  Mohamed Khan told Al Jazeera that all allegations against him were false and were based on speculation, conjecture and manufactured and doctored evidence. He confirmed that he was the owner of the PKSA Group and of SALT and that Gold Leaf was a client of SALT but he denied involvement in money laundering or other criminal activity. He denied bribing anyone who worked in the South African banking sector.  Liberty Gold denied all knowledge of the matters and individuals we featured, while Vantage Leaf denied any knowing involvement in money laundering or false invoicing.  Sasfin Bank told Al Jazeera it was taking vigorous action against suspended and former employees and clients of its foreign exchange unit and said that it no longer had a relationship with any of the businesses identified in this investigation, including SALT.  ABSA said it had passed Al Jazeera's findings to its Forensic Investigative Unit, while Standard Bank told Al Jazeera it has a zero-tolerance stance relating to fraud and criminality and would report and assist in any legal investigation.

Rapidly melting Antarctic ice is dramatically slowing down the flow of water through the world's oceans and could have a disastrous effect on global climate, the marine food chain, and even the stability of ice shelves, new research says.  The  overturning circulation  of the oceans - driven by the movement of denser water towards the sea floor - helps deliver heat, carbon, oxygen and vital nutrients around the globe.  However, deep ocean water flows from the Antarctic could decline by 40 percent by 2050, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, which warned of effects that would last  for centuries to come .   That's stunning to see that happen so quickly,  said Alan Mix, a paleoclimatologist at Oregon State University and co-author on the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments, who was not involved in the study.   It appears to be kicking into gear right now. That's headline news.   If the model holds true, the deep ocean current will be  on a trajectory that looks headed towards collapse , said University of New South Wales (UNSW) climate professor Matthew England who coordinated the study.  'Profound effects'  As temperatures rise, freshwater from Antarctica's melting ice enters the ocean, reducing the salinity and density of the surface water and diminishing that downward flow to the sea's bottom.  While past research has looked at what could happen to similar overturning circulation in the North Atlantic - the mechanism behind a doomsday scenario that would see Europe suffer from an Arctic blast as heat transport falters - less has been done on Antarctic bottom water circulation.  Scientists relied on about 35 million computing hours over two years to crank through a variety of models and simulations up to the middle of this century, finding deep-water circulation in the Antarctic could weaken at twice the rate of decline in the North Atlantic.  UNSW emeritus professor John Church, who was not involved in the study, said there were many uncertainties about the impact of declining deep ocean circulation.   But it seems almost certain that continuing on a high greenhouse gas emission pathway will lead to even more profound effects on the ocean and the climate system,  Church said.   The world urgently needs to drastically reduce our emissions to get off the high-emission pathway we are currently following.   The study team included lead author Qian Li of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-authors from the Australian National University and Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).  'Disaster scenarios'  The effect of meltwater on global ocean circulation has not yet been included in the complex models used by the IPCC to describe future climate change scenarios, but it is going to be considerable, England said.  Ocean overturning allows nutrients to rise up from the bottom with the Southern Ocean supporting about three-quarters of global phytoplankton production, the base of the food chain, said a second study co-author Steve Rintoul.   If we slow the sinking near Antarctica, we slow down the whole circulation and so we also reduce the amount of nutrients that get returned from the deep ocean back up to the surface,  said Rintoul, a fellow at CSIRO.  The study's findings also suggest the ocean would not be able to absorb as much carbon dioxide as its upper layers become more stratified, leaving more CO2 in the atmosphere.  The study showed warm water intrusions in the western Antarctican ice shelf would increase, but it did not look at how this might create a feedback effect and generate even more melting.   It doesn't include the disaster scenarios,  said Mix.  In that sense, it's actually kind of conservative.

The smuggling feeds into an enormous money-laundering operation, all facilitated by Fidelity Gold Refinery, a subsidiary of Zimbabwe's central bank, and enabled, in some cases, directly by senior government officials and relatives of the country's president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.  Zimbabwe's government needs United States dollars because the local currency has no value in international trade following sustained hyperinflation over many years. Gold - the country's biggest export - is a good way to earn dollars.  But although gold trade itself is not barred, the additional scrutiny sanctions bring on Zimbabwean officials smother the government's ability to transact directly in the international financial system, especially in dollars, said Karen Greenaway, a former US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent who tracks illicit money flows.   So you have to figure out other ways to do that,  she told Al Jazeera.  Meanwhile, global money launderers have undeclared cash they need to turn into legitimate money. Gold smugglers offer a way around these complications both for money launderers and the Zimbabwe government.  Smugglers, who do not face the sanctions government officials do, carry Zimbabwe's gold to Dubai, where it is then sold in exchange for clean cash. This money is transferred to the bank accounts of the money launderers, who hand over an equivalent amount of their dollars to the Zimbabwe government, through the smugglers.   Moving the money abroad and then washing it and then moving it back in. It's a very common money laundering technique,  money laundering expert Paul Holden told Al Jazeera.  What I haven't seen is the use of gold, which I think is quite interesting.   This revelation is part of The Gold Mafia, a four-part series that reveals how rival gangs have taken over the gold trade in Southern Africa and how they launder hundreds of millions of dollars.  Al Jazeera's reporters posed as Chinese criminals looking for a way to launder more than $100m. Several gangs with high-ranking connections in Zimbabwe's government all offered ways to launder the money using smuggled gold.  The smugglers  Al Jazeera's I-Unit infiltrated multiple smuggling gangs during the course of the investigation. The most prominent among them involved Ewan Macmillan, who has been in jail several times; Kamlesh Pattni, a smuggler accused of nearly bankrupting Kenya's economy in the 1990s; and Simon Rudland, a millionaire cigarette entrepreneur.  Under Zimbabwean law, only the country's central bank can buy gold from miners. But it often does not have enough money to pay the nation's miners, so it contracts smuggling gangs to buy gold on its behalf.   When a person comes to sell me gold, I don't have to write his name down, I don't have to do anything,  said Macmillan, while offering his services to the Al Jazeera reporters.  I just take his gold, pay him, he leaves. I deliver to the government. Government asks me no questions.   Pattni has a similar deal with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, documents accessed by Al Jazeera show.  The central bank, in turn, has issued licenses to these smugglers to carry millions of dollars worth of gold out of the country, the documents reveal.   This country has sanctions. So the country can't sell the gold. So an individual can sell it, because he doesn't have sanctions,  Macmillan said.  Cleaning gold and money  Using a group of couriers, the gold is then smuggled to Dubai in hand luggage and suitcases, where it is refined and marked with a Dubai stamp, removing any trace of its troubled origins and making it easier to sell on international markets.   It's smuggling, that's what it is,  Macmillan smilingly acknowledged.  Documents show that Pattni and Macmillan are then authorised to bring cash, ostensibly from the sale of the gold, back into Zimbabwe. One document, for instance, shows that a Pattni company can carry $3mn cash per week into Zimbabwe.   We have our own license, clearing at the Dubai airport. We have permission of the central bank of Dubai. We have permission from the Reserve Bank [of Zimbabwe],  Pattni told the undercover Al Jazeera reporters.  This process allows these smugglers to also clean dirty cash - for others, and themselves.  Rudland, an acquaintance of Macmillan, owns Gold Leaf Tobacco, one of Southern Africa's largest cigarette companies. South African revenue authorities have accused Rudland of evading taxes by selling cigarettes on the black market.  Al Jazeera's investigation uncovered a complex web of front companies and fake identities that helps Rudland move hundreds of millions of dollars of cash across borders, for non-existent imports. Some of these companies help him export Zimbabwean gold, while others buy that very same gold from Rudland's couriers in Dubai.  The president's 'diplomat'  Al Jazeera's team also uncovered a different, more direct route employed by senior representatives of President Mnangagwa to bring in dirty money in exchange for the country's gold.  Uebert Angel, one of Zimbabwe's highest-ranking diplomats, was appointed personally by Mnangagwa in 2021 as an ambassador-at-large and a presidential envoy, tasked with drawing in foreign investment.  Angel, who is also a pastor at his Good News Church, told Al Jazeera that he could use his diplomatic status to smuggle gold for cash with the help of Henrietta Rushwaya, a niece of Mnangagwa and the president of Zimbabwe's mining association.  On a phone call, Rushwaya explained the scheme: Launderers park $10mn of dirty cash into the government's gold refinery, Fidelity. Of that, $5mn would be held in reserve by Fidelity for the duration of the scam, with the rest being used every week to buy gold - which can then be sold in Dubai in return for clean money.   You want gold, gold we can do it right now, we can make the call right now, and it's done,  Angel told Al Jazeera's reporters.  It will land in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe can't touch it too until I get to my house. So there can be a diplomatic plan.   During the meetings, Angel and his deputy, British pastor and musical artist Rikki Doolan, repeatedly said everything they were doing had the approval of  number one , referring to Mnangagwa.  Asked for a response to Al Jazeera's investigation, Simon Rudland, the cigarette entrepreneur, told us that all allegations against him were false and formed part of a smear campaign against him by an unidentified third party. He described himself as  a strong businessman... competing against the greedy and the envious . He denied any involvement in the sale of illicit cigarettes, in gold or other smuggling and in sanctions busting.  Gold Leaf Tobacco, his company, said that it emphatically denied any involvement, past or present, in money laundering, the trade in illegal gold or related matters.  The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe told us that it takes the issues of money laundering and illicit trade very seriously and will not participate, directly or indirectly, in such activities.  Fidelity, its subsidiary, denied having any business relationship with Simon Rudland or giving gold exporting licenses or incentives to those we identified. It also denied all involvement in money laundering, smuggling and sanctions busting.  Fidelity denied having any business relationship with Simon Rudland or giving gold exporting licences or incentives to those we identified.

He denied involvement in any kind of money laundering or sanctions busting, as well as employing anyone to smuggle cash or offering to deal with funds he knew originated from illegal sources.  President Mnangagwa, Angel, Doolan, Macmillan and Rushwaya did not respond to Al Jazeera's request to comment on the investigation's findings."}, {"source": "al-jazeera-english", "title": "How a 'Gold Mafia' is looting Southern Africa, washing dirty cash", "text": "An investigation by Al Jazeera has revealed some of Southern Africa's largest gold-smuggling operations, exposing how these gangs help criminals around the world launder billions of dollars while aiding governments in circumventing international sanctions.  Gold Mafia, a four-part series by Al Jazeera's Investigative Unit (I-Unit) based on dozens of undercover operations spanning three continents, and thousands of documents, also shows how government officials and businesspeople are profiting off the illegal movement of gold across borders.  The investigation reveals how billions of dollars' worth of gold is smuggled every month from Zimbabwe to Dubai, allowing criminals to whitewash dirty money through a web of shell companies, fake invoices and paid-off officials.  The investigation also shows how Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government is systematically using gold smugglers to get around the chokehold of Western sanctions imposed on the country. The money laundering and gold-smuggling schemes involve one of Zimbabwe's most influential diplomats, and go all the way up to the president and his circle.  The smugglers include millionaires, one of whom was accused of almost bankrupting Kenya through a similar, corrupt scheme also involving gold.  Gold smuggling, money laundering  Posing as criminals from China looking to launder over $100m, Al Jazeera's undercover reporters managed to gain access to these smugglers and gangs.  Zimbabwe is a key player in these operations. Gold accounts for almost half -- over $2bn -- of the country's exports. But the nation faces a strict international sanctions regime, and even though its gold trade is not in itself banned by the West, the broader strictures against Zimbabwe make it harder to export the precious metal through official channels.  However, using a web of companies and patronage from some of Zimbabwe's most powerful individuals, smugglers have turned those constraints on trade into an opportunity to launder billions of dollars and help the government in Harare get around some of the consequences of sanctions.  The process is as simple as it is cunning: Criminals from around the world with large volumes of unaccounted cash can give that money to the Zimbabwean government, directly or through smugglers. The Zimbabwean government desperately needs US dollars since the county's own currency has little international value following years of hyperinflation.  In exchange, launderers get clean, legitimate cash -- from the sale of Zimbabwean gold -- transferred to their bank accounts.  'Good washing machine'  One of the smuggling operations the I-Unit encountered was led by Uebert Angel, Zimbabwe's ambassador-at-large to Europe and the Americas. Angel was appointed personally by Mnangagwa with the responsibility of securing global investments for Zimbabwe, and is one of the country's most influential diplomats.  Angel, who is also a prominent pastor, works with his deputy, Rikki Doolan. The duo made an offer to Al Jazeera's undercover reporters that Angel could use his diplomatic cover to smuggle dirty money into Zimbabwe. That cash would then be used to purchase Zimbabwean gold with the help of Henrietta Rushwaya, president of the country's mining association and a niece of Mnangagwa.   It's a good washing machine, right?  Doolan said, a smile on his face, while speaking with Al Jazeera reporters.  Angel and Doolan repeatedly claimed that the country's president was on board with their plans. Angel had another laundering idea too: He proposed using the unaccounted money to build a hotel near Victoria Falls, a popular tourist attraction in Zimbabwe.  'It's very clean that way'  If access to power is the currency that Angel and Doolan peddled, gold is the calling card of a string of -- at times rival -- smuggling operations.  One of the gangs is run by Kamlesh Pattni, a businessman who in the 1990s was accused of pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars belonging to the Kenyan exchequer through a gold smuggling scheme. He was charged but never convicted. Al Jazeera's undercover operation shows that Pattni is now involved in a similar scam in Zimbabwe, exporting gold to Dubai and then laundering both the money and the precious metal.  Pattni's biggest competitor, a gold smuggler named Ewan Macmillan, also offered to help launder money for Al Jazeera's reporters. Like Pattni, Macmillan, uses a group of couriers to transport hundreds of kilos of gold per week from Zimbabwe to Dubai, where it is then laundered through a web of companies and false invoices. Central to Macmillan's operations is his business partner Alistair Mathias, who advises clients on how to cleanse their dirty cash.  Finally, Al Jazeera obtained details of how Simon Rudland, one of Zimbabwe's richest men, launders money through both Zimbabwean and South African companies. Rudland is the owner of Gold Leaf Tobacco, one of southern Africa's biggest cigarette brands, especially on South Africa's black market.  These smuggling gangs have official licenses from Zimbabwe's central bank that allow them to sell the country's gold in Dubai, documents accessed by Al Jazeera show. They are expected to return the proceeds from those sales back to the central bank.  Instead, Pattni, Macmillan and Matthias have a well-oiled money laundering mechanism in place. They told Al Jazeera's undercover reporters to set up shell companies in Dubai that would serve as a front for gold trade. The legitimate money earned from the sale of Zimbabwean gold in the emirate would be transferred to the bank accounts of these shell firms. And the smugglers would instead carry the dirty cash back with them to Harare, where they would deposit it with the central bank.   So, it's very clean that way,  said Mathias, Macmillan's partner.  When asked about the findings of Al Jazeera's investigations, Pattni said no allegation of criminal wrongdoing had been upheld against him in Kenya. He denied involvement in any kind of money laundering, as well as employing anyone to smuggle cash or offering to deal with funds he knew originated from illegal sources. He said that when he met with our undercover team, he thought he was meeting with an investor who wanted to sell a stake in hotel businesses and  to divest of a portfolio in China into gold buying and mining in Zimbabwe .  Alistair Mathias denied that he designed mechanisms to launder money and said that he had never laundered money or traded illegal gold. He told us he had never had any working relationship with Ewan Macmillan.  Rudland told Al Jazeera that all allegations against him were false and formed part of a smear campaign by an unidentified third party. He described himself as  a strong businessman ... competing against the greedy and the envious . He denied any involvement in the sale of illicit cigarettes, in gold or other smuggling and in sanctions busting.  Gold Leaf Tobacco, Rudland's company, said that it emphatically denied any involvement, past or present, in money laundering, the trade in illegal gold or related matters.

It's the latest accusation that Russia, desperate for weaponry and restricted by sanctions and export controls, is turning to  rogue  nations to help it continue to prosecute the 13-month-old war.   As part of this proposed deal, Russia would receive over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions from Pyongyang,  White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.  We also understand that Russia is seeking to send a delegation to North Korea and that Russia is offering North Korea food in exchange for munitions.   The administration has previously declassified intelligence to present evidence that Iran sold hundreds of attack drones to Russia over the summer and that the Wagner Group, a private Russian military company, has taken delivery of arms from North Korea to help bolster its forces as they fight side-by-side with Russian troops in Ukraine.  ADVERTISEMENT  Experts believe the food situation in North Korea is the worst it has been under Kim Jong Un's 11-year rule, but they still say they see no signs of imminent famine or mass deaths. Kim vowed to strengthen state control over agriculture and take a spate of other steps to increase grain production, North Korean state media reported earlier this month.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that U.S. intelligence suggested China was considering providing arms and ammunition to Russia , though White House officials have said they have yet to see evidence of Beijing following through with weapons delivery.  The publicizing of Russia's efforts to get weapons from North Korea is just the latest example of the Biden administration loosening restrictions on intelligence findings and making them public over the course of the grinding war in Ukraine.  The administration has said it has sought to disseminate the intelligence findings so allies and the public remain clear-eyed about Moscow's intent and Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks twice about his actions.  Earlier Thursday, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control announced sanctions against a Slovakian national, Ashot Mkrtychev, alleging he attempted to facilitate arms deals between Russia and North Korea.  ADVERTISEMENT  Kirby said Mkrtychev is at the center of the new North Korea-Russia deal, which has yet to be consummated. He added that the U.S. does not have evidence that Mkrtychev was involved in the earlier transfer of weapons to Russia's Wagner Group, whose mercenaries have been in the center of a monthslong battle for the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.  Between the end of 2022 and early 2023, Treasury said Mkrtychev worked with North Korean officials to obtain over two dozen kinds of weapons and munitions for Russia in exchange for commercial aircraft, raw materials and commodities to be sent to North Korea.  ADVERTISEMENT  Mkrtychev worked with a Russian citizen to find commercial aircraft to delivers goods to North Korea in the exchange.   Russia has lost over 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment since the start of the war, and thanks in part to multilateral sanctions and export controls, Putin has become increasingly desperate to replace them,  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.  Schemes like the arms deal pursued by this individual show that Putin is turning to suppliers of last resort like Iran and the DPRK.   North Korea, an outlier on the global stage, has sought to enhance relations with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine brought an avalanche of sanctions from the West and broad international condemnation.  Any arms deal with Russia would be a violation of U.N. resolutions that ban North Korea from exporting to or importing weapons from other countries.  North Korea is the only nation aside from Russia and Syria to recognize the independence of Russia-backed separatist territories, Donetsk and Luhansk, in eastern Ukraine."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Canada mass shooting inquiry identifies many police failings", "text": "FILE - A memorial pays tribute to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Constable Heidi Stevenson, a mother of two and a 23-year veteran of the force, along the highway in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia, on Tuesday, April 21, 2020.

(Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press via AP, File)  TRURO, Nova Scotia (AP) -- A public inquiry has found widespread failures in how Canada's federal police force responded to the country's worst mass shooting and recommends that the government rethink the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's central role in the country's policing.  In a seven-volume report released Thursday, the Mass Casualty Commission also says the RCMP missed red flags in the years leading up to the Nova Scotia rampage on April 18-19, 2020, which left 22 people slain by a denture maker disguised as an RCMP officer and driving a replica police vehicle.  The assailant, Gabriel Wortman, was killed by two Mounties at a gas station in Enfield, Nova Scotia, 13 hours into his rampage. Disguised as a police officer , Wortman shot people in their homes and set fires in a killing spree that included 16 crime scenes in five rural communities across the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called it one of the darkest chapters in Canadian history and said he hopes the report is one of the many steps toward ensuring a tragedy like that never happens again. Trudeau attended the report's release in Nova Scotia and said his government will examine it closely.  There is no question that there needs to be changes and there will be,  Trudeau said.  ADVERTISEMENT  Among other things, the commission says the national police force is badly disorganized. Its review of the RCMP's 5,000 pages of policies and procedures found the force's own members were unclear on proper responses to critical incidents and communication with the public.  The report delves deeply into the causes of the mass shooting. These include the killer's violence toward his spouse and the failure of police to act on it, and  implicit biases  that seemed to blind officers and community members to the danger a white, male professional posed.  In response, the commissioners call for a future RCMP where the current 26-week model of training is scrapped -- as it's no longer sufficient for the complex demands of policing. The academy would be replaced with a three-year, degree-based model of education, as exists in Finland.  The document begins with an account of the police errors in the years before the killings, and the events of April 18 and 19.  The report's summary says that soon after the shooting started in Portapique, Nova Scotia, RCMP commanders disregarded witness accounts, and senior Mounties wrongly assumed residents were mistaken when they reported seeing the killer driving a fully marked RCMP cruiser.  ADVERTISEMENT   Important community sources of information were ignored,  it says.  In addition, the report says police failed to promptly send out alerts to the public with a description of the killer until it was too late for some of his victims.  Having laid out a litany of shortcomings, the inquiry calls for a fresh external review of the police force. It says the federal minister of public safety should then establish priorities for the RCMP,  retaining the tasks that are suitable to a federal policing agency, and identifying what responsibilities are better reassigned to other agencies.    This may entail a reconfiguration of policing in Canada and a new approach to federal financial support for provincial and municipal policing services,  the report says.  ADVERTISEMENT  Michael Duheme, the interim RCMP commissioner, said he hasn't had time to go through the recommendations despite the RCMP getting a copy of the report on Wednesday.  Duheme said he was  deeply sorry  for the pain and suffering endured by families of the victims.  I can't even imagine what you have endured,  he said, adding that the RCMP  must learn and we are committed to do just that.   Dennis Daley, the head of the RCMP in Nova Scotia, said to the families that he knows that the response  wasn't what you needed to be. And for that I am deeply sorry.   The victims in Canada's worst mass shooting included an RCMP officer, a teacher, health-care workers, retirees, neighbors of the shooter and two correctional officers killed in their home. The rampage started when Wortman attacked his spouse.   Nothing will bring my brother back or any of the other people in this horrible ordeal,  said Scott McLeod, the brother of victim Sean McLeod.  If this report makes a positive change nationwide it will be appreciated, I know, by families.   The report details Wortman 's history of domestic violence in his relationships with women, including his spouse Lisa Banfield. In particular, the report notes the experience of Brenda Forbes, a neighbor in Portapique who informed the RCMP of Wortman's violence toward Banfield. He never faced any consequences, but she dealt with years of stalking, harassment and threats from Wortman, prompting her to leave the province.  Jessica Zita, lawyer for Banfield, read a statement from her client in which she says she hopes there will be meaningful changes from the recommendations especially those involving domestic violence.

(March 30)  NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Authorities released 911 recordings on Thursday that capture the terror inside a Nashville elementary school during a mass shooting this week, as callers pleaded for help in hushed voices while sirens, crying and gunfire could be heard in the background.  Police released recordings of about two-dozen emergency calls made during Monday's attack at The Covenant School, in which three children and three adults were killed . They include the voices of teachers and school officials, some whispering while hiding in classrooms, closets, bathrooms and offices, as alarms rang loudly. One teacher tells an operator she is with 17 children in a classroom and hearing  so many shots.   In another call, 76-year-old retired church member Tom Pulliam tells the dispatcher he is with a group, including several children, walking away from the Christian school. Although Pulliam remains calm, the tension and confusion of the situation are clear, with several adults speaking over each other and children's voices in the background.  When the dispatcher requests a description of the shooter, Pulliam asks a second man to get on the line.   All I saw was a man holding an assault rifle shooting through the door. It was -- he's currently in the second grade hallway, upstairs  the man says, noting that the assailant was dressed in camouflage.  ADVERTISEMENT  Asked about how many shots were fired, a woman responds,  I heard about 10, and I left the building.   Pulliam, who was driving with his wife near the church when the attack happened, told The Associated Press on Thursday that he is struggling to make sense of it. He said he mostly recalls the children and how calm they seemed, not  yelling and screaming or anything.    Up there for a normal day of school, these young children,  he said.  Now, there's difficult days to go through.   In another call that started just before 10:13 a.m., a woman tells a dispatcher that she can hear a pause in the gunshots from her hiding spot in an art room closet.  Asked if it is a safe spot, the woman answers,  I think so,  as children can be heard in the background.  The teacher then says she can hear more gunshots, begging the dispatcher,  Please hurry.   In another call, lead pastor Chad Scruggs, whose daughter was killed in the attack, identifies himself and tells the operator he's outside the building and heading toward the gunshots.   I'm getting calls from the inside,  he says.  One woman, who hid under a desk in a nursery, tells a dispatcher the school, which is attached to the Covenant Presbyterian Church, sometimes has some staff members carry firearms but does not have dedicated security guards.   We do have a school person, or two, I'm not sure, who would be packing -- whose job it is for security,  she says.  We don't have security guards, but we have a staff.   A spokesman for the police department did not immediately respond to a message asking who from the school might have been armed for security. A school spokesperson said the school didn't immediately have comment on the question.

Most protesters were removed from the gallery after some began yelling down at the lawmakers,  Children are dead!

The three adults were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and Mike Hill, a 61-year-old custodian. Funeral plans for the six victims were announced , with the first service scheduled on Friday, for Evelyn. Evelyn's obituary urged mourners to wear joyful colors as a tribute to her  light and love of color.   The protests followed a Wednesday night candlelight vigil in Nashville where Republican lawmakers stood alongside first lady Jill Biden , Democratic lawmakers and musicians including Sheryl Crow. The speakers read the victims' names and offered condolences but refrained from political statements.  Absent from the vigil was Tennessee's Republican governor, Bill Lee, who has avoided public appearances this week and has not proposed any steps his administration might take in response to the shooting. Lee has been an advocate for less restrictive gun laws along with greater school security.  As with similar responses to gun violence, the state's Republican leaders have avoided calling for tighter gun restrictions and instead have thrown their support behind bolstering school security.  In a letter to Lee, Republican Lt. Gov. Randy McNally called for securing windows and glass in school buildings, adding magnetic locks on doors, modernizing camera systems, and increasing armed guards. McNally said later that he also is in favor of red flag laws like one in Florida .  ADVERTISEMENT  Meanwhile, Tennessee's U.S. senators, Republicans Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, were pushing for legislation that would create a $900 million grant program to  harden  schools and hire safety officers.  Police have said Hale drove up to the school on Monday morning, shot out the glass doors, entered and began firing indiscriminately. Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief John Drake has not said what investigators think the shooter's motive was, only noting that the assailant didn't target specific victims and had  some resentment for having to go to that school.   Drake said the shooter had drawn a detailed map of the school , including potential entry points, and conducted surveillance before carrying out the attack.  Police have said Hale was under a doctor's care for an undisclosed  emotional disorder.  However, authorities haven't disclosed a link between that care and the shooting. Police also said Hale was not on their radar before the attack.  Social media accounts and other sources indicate that the shooter identified as a man and might have recently begun using the first name Aiden. Police have said Hale  was assigned female at birth  but used masculine pronouns on a social media profile. However, police have continued to use female pronouns and the name Audrey to describe Hale.  ___  ADVERTISEMENT  Sainz reported from Memphis. Associated Press writer Kristin M.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)  AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge in Texas who previously ruled to dismantle the Affordable Care Act struck down a narrower but key part of the nation's health law Thursday that requires most insurers to cover preventive services that include screenings for cancer, diabetes and mental health.  Other no-cost services, including HIV screenings, are also impacted under the ruling by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor that opponents say will jeopardize preventive care for millions of Americans.  Experts cautioned that insurers are unlikely to stop any coverage immediately. The Biden administration was expected to appeal and seek a stay of the ruling.   This is not the potential fatal blow to the ACA like previous court cases, but it would limit a very popular benefit that tens of millions of people use,  said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation.  The decision comes more than four years after O'Connor, a nominee of former President George W. Bush, ruled that the entire health care law also known as  Obamacare  was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that ruling.  ADVERTISEMENT  This time O'Conner blocked only the requirement that most insurers cover a range of preventive care -- including screenings for multiple types of cancer -- siding with plaintiffs who include a conservative activist in Texas and a Christian dentist who opposed mandatory coverage for contraception and an HIV prevention treatment on religious grounds.  The requirements for coverage are driven by recommendations by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which is made up of volunteers. O'Connor ruled that enforcing the recommendations was  unlawful  and a violation of the Constitution's Appointment Clause, which lays out how government officials can be appointed.  Dr. Michael Barry, chairman of the federal task force, said in a statement following the ruling that people with low incomes have been able to get services they need as care has expanded over the past decade because of the law.   Fundamentally, people across the country deserve the opportunity to receive these important preventive services that have been proven to help them live longer and healthier lives,  Barry said.  White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services were reviewing the ruling, but called the case  yet another attack  on the health care law that has been in place for 13 years and survived multiple legal challenges.  The Biden administration previously told the court that the outcome of the case  could create extraordinary upheaval in the United States' public health system.  More than 20 states, mostly controlled by Democrats, had urged O'Connor against a sweeping ruling that would do away with the preventive care coverage requirement entirely.  The ruling applies to recommendations made by the task force after March 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Some of the nation's largest medical groups came out against the lawsuit, warning that insurers in the future could impose cost-sharing on patients for screenings that are now fully covered.  Levitt said if O'Connor's ruling is allowed to stand, insurers are likely to look at changes in coverage beginning in the next calendar year, since existing contracts are already in effect.  ADVERTISEMENT  Although the ruling impacts a broad spectrum of preventive care, it does not wipe out coverage for all preventive screenings. For instance, experts said the decision would not overturn coverage for preventive women's health services that were approved outside the task force.  Some cancer screenings approved before 2010 would also not be affected, including screenings for cervical and colorectal cancer, said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president and director for women's health policy at the Kaiser foundation. But she said screenings for lung and skin cancer, which were more recently approved, could be affected.  In September, O'Connor ruled that required coverage of the HIV prevention treatment known as PrEP, which is a pill taken daily to prevent infection, violated the plaintiffs' religious beliefs. That decision also undercut the broader system that determines which preventive drugs are covered in the U.S., ruling that a federal task force that recommends coverage of preventive treatments is unconstitutional.  Employers' religious objections have been a sticking point in past challenges to former President Barack Obama's health care law, including over contraception.  The lawsuit is among the attempts by conservatives to chip away at the Affordable Care Act -- or wipe it out entirely -- since it was signed into law in 2010. The attorney who filed the suit was an architect of the Texas abortion law that was the nation's strictest before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June and allowed states to ban the procedure.  ___  Associated Press reporters Amanda Seitz and Seung Min Kim in Washington contributed to this report."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "CNN preaches patience as ratings tank during turnaround", "text": "FILE - The CNN logo is displayed at the entrance to the CNN Center in Atlanta on Feb. 2, 2022.

(AP Photo/Ron Harris, File)  NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN's leadership is preaching patience even though thousands of viewers are abandoning the network during its attempted turnaround, with no indication yet whether it will be rewarded.  Cable news ratings are down across the board compared to 2022, when Russia's invasion of Ukraine was fresh in the news. CNN's dip is most dramatic -- 61% in prime time in March, with Fox News Channel down 27% and MSNBC off by 12%, according to the Nielsen company.  Fox averaged 2.09 million viewers in prime time in March, with MSNBC at 1.14 million and CNN at 473,000, Nielsen said. In the key 25-54 age demographic for advertisers, CNN is seeing some of its lowest numbers in decades.  CNN is a year into new corporate management with Warner Bros. Discovery, which hired ex-CBS producer Chris Licht to run the network. The chief goal has been to rebuild trust as a non-partisan news brand after years of criticism by former President Donald Trump and his followers, at a time Fox and MSNBC have profited handsomely by appealing to specific points of view.  ADVERTISEMENT  Licht's biggest programming move to date, a revamp of  CNN This Morning,  hasn't borne fruit in the ratings and has been beset by bad publicity, including co-host Don Lemon's ham-fisted reference to a woman's prime years.  Changes to CNN's daytime look are imminent . Licht's vision for prime time is months away, though, and only beginning to take shape.  His plans are to couple news coverage with hosts from different worlds, including entertainment, who can talk about the news without a specific partisan take. Licht is exploring several possibilities, and CNN is reportedly close to deals with CBS' Gayle King and former NBA star turned sportscaster Charles Barkley for shows that will air once a week, although the network wouldn't confirm that.  If Licht's bet pays off, CNN will strengthen its reputation as a news brand while also attracting viewers who are now watching Netflix or HGTV -- not just competing news networks.  As those plans develop, CNN's prime-time lineup has largely been in flux after Anderson Cooper's hour at 8 p.m. Eastern. The network has experimented with some interviews, events and subject-focused hours at 9 p.m. Eastern. They include talks with first lady Jill Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and town halls with Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and one focused on the Ohio train derailment.  ADVERTISEMENT  The news hours that follow, at least for now, are led by Alisyn Camerota and Laura Coates.   Viewers are a bit confused with all of the changes, particularly in the prime-time lineup,  said Jennifer Thomas, a former CNN producer who now teaches journalism at Howard University. She said CNN needs more news that impacts viewers and less analysis.  CNN expresses pride in some of the efforts, while admitting some are duds. Last Friday, for example, only 295,000 people watched Jake Tapper's interview with  Ted Lasso  star Jason Sudeikis. It was less than a quarter of the people who saw Alex Wagner's MSNBC show at the same 9 p.m. Eastern time slot, Nielsen said.  ADVERTISEMENT  David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, delivered a pep talk to hundreds of CNN managers earlier this month to reinforce the message that he wanted to see a network focused on the news that didn't lean any way politically.  CNN saw strong ratings under the leadership of Licht's predecessor, Jeff Zucker, and Zaslav said he recognized that a more partisan approach could bring more viewers and money, but that  it's not what I came here to do ,  according to a transcript of Zaslav's speech.  He said he hoped the network would be able to figure out what is working and what isn't. He urged the managers to not worry about outside noise.   Ratings be damned,  he said.  Let's focus on who we are. This is our mission. This is our legacy. And this is our journey together.   The question for Licht and his team, as it is often in similar situations, is  how much time do they really have?  said Mark Whitaker, a former executive at CNN and NBC News.  ADVERTISEMENT  Strong ratings mean more revenue, and more money to spend on programming, Whitaker said.  Cable news viewership is often very habit-driven, with viewers drawn to personalities they know and trust, he said. For the first three days this week, CNN's 9 p.m. Eastern hour had three different hosts -- Erin Burnett, Pamela Brown and Kaitlan Collins.  CNN must wonder whether viewers will lose the habit of tuning in while waiting for the network's true personality to emerge under Licht. A new prime-time schedule is not likely until the fall.  It doesn't help that many CNN viewers have long considered the network a utility to be used primarily when there are big stories, and it's a relatively quiet period now. An important test will be how many viewers will reflexively turn to CNN during big news events, where it has often dominated the ratings.  MSNBC, in touting its biggest audience advantage over CNN in nearly four years, said that its viewers watched the network an average of 381 minutes per week during the first three months of 2023, compared to 183 minutes for CNN.  ADVERTISEMENT   They're fighting against the toughest foe they can fight,  said Rick Kaplan, a former CNN president.  They're fighting against short attention spans. They're fighting against the fact that we're such a divided people, so angry at each other, that if you don't reflect that anger, the people don't have time for you.   Continued poor ratings  eats away at the fabric of the network, if you're doing great shows and nobody is watching,  he said.  Kaplan said he believes CNN has the right executive in Licht, who has a strong track record as a successful programmer.   If there's a right way, he'll find it,  he said."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "Used car prices are surging. Here's why you should buy now", "text": "Used car prices are surging.

Rice's timing to buy the truck was ideal, taking advantage of a recent dip in used car prices which now appear to be heading back up. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)  Well, it was nice while it lasted.  For nearly a year, the average used vehicle in the United States had been edging toward affordable again for millions of people. The relief felt belated and relatively slight, but it was welcome nonetheless.  From an eye-watering peak of $31,400 in April of last year, the average price had dropped 14% to $27,125 early this month.  Now, with the supply of used vehicles failing to keep up with robust demand, prices are creeping up again, with signs pointing to further increases ahead. So many buyers have been priced out of the new-car market that fewer trade-ins are landing on dealer lots. Deepening the shortage, fewer used vehicles are coming off leases or being off-loaded by rental car companies.  Average list prices for used car have edged up by about $700 in the past month, and Alex Yurchenko, chief data officer for Black Book, which tracks prices, expects them to keep rising at least into summer.  ADVERTISEMENT   If you have to buy a used vehicle,  he suggested,  right now would be a good time.   Pete Catalano, a dealer in Independence, Missouri, near Kansas City, has been struggling to get his hands on enough affordably priced cars. Typically, Catalano and his daughter, who co-own Stadium Auto, would have about 50 vehicles on their used-car lot near Arrowhead Stadium. They now have only about half as many. Some of their rival dealers, Catalano said, enjoy a competitive advantage because they can afford to offer financing to buyers with poor credit.  Squeezed by higher prices for gasoline, groceries and utilities, many of Catalano's customers can't afford either new or late-model used vehicles. Some would-be buyers he knows are using tax refunds just to make ends meet instead of buying a needed car.   A used inexpensive car is now becoming more and more of a luxury,  Catalano said.  What the market wants right now is not available, and that's $3,000, $4,000 and $5,000 cars.   Behind the vehicle shortage and inflated prices is simple supply and demand. Much of the problem stems from the surging prices of new cars. In February, according to Edmunds, the average new vehicle in the United States sold for nearly $48,000 -- beyond the reach of many consumers.  Though the supply of new vehicles has inched up, they remain relatively scarce and expensive. Automakers still lack sufficient computer chips to produce enough vehicles to meet demand, a lingering consequence of pandemic-related supply shortages. Sales of new vehicles last year were about 3 million below normal levels. Fewer new-car sales mean fewer trade-ins, which mean fewer used vehicles for sale.  ADVERTISEMENT  With used prices rising again, analysts say buyers who can afford to do so should buy soon. Auto loan rates may continue rising this year as the Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates.  On used lots these days, bargains are hard to find. Even after accounting for the price drops of the past year, the average used vehicle remains about 35% above where it was before the pandemic erupted three years ago. At that time, the average price was $20,425.  ADVERTISEMENT  Once the government sent stimulus checks to most American households, demand for autos rose as many people spent their money. As they did, the supply of used vehicles fell and prices surged. By early last year, the average used-vehicle price was more than 50% above its pre-pandemic point.  Worsening the shortfall was a scarcity of affordable new vehicles. Automakers were using their tight supply of computer chips to build pricier and more profitable SUVs and pickups. They built fewer affordable new models -- a trend that sent more buyers to used-car lots. The result was increased demand and higher prices for used vehicles.  All of which left people like Carol Rice struggling to find a decent affordable used vehicle. Rice, 65, endured a long period of frustration while shopping for a used small pickup for her farm near Carbondale, Kansas. For six months, she found little.   I'm retired, and I can't afford to buy a new vehicle,  she said.  There weren't that many used vehicles, and if there were used vehicles, they were quite expensive.   ADVERTISEMENT  Last month, she finally found a 2003 Ford Ranger on Catalano's website that she liked and could afford. She bought it for $7,700. Though it's 20 years old and has 140,000 miles on it, the Ranger is in solid condition and has the all-wheel-drive that Rice wanted.   It was a good-looking vehicle, and the price was right,  she said.  In the immediate future, few analysts expect price declines for used vehicles. Catalano doesn't foresee any sustained price drops for perhaps the next year or two.  Others say it's hard to predict. Amy Gieffers, a senior vice president at Vroom, an online auto buying site, notes that some market forces could continue to keep supply down and prices up: Fewer trade-ins, less leasing, lower fleet sales by rental car companies.  On the other hand, she says, more expensive vehicles and higher loan rates could depress buyer demand. Eventually, dealers might be forced to cut prices.  ADVERTISEMENT   It's really complex right now,  she said,  because you have some competing forces.   Both Yurchenko of Black Book and Charlie Chesbrough, a senior economist at Cox Automotive, say they expect used-vehicle prices to rise through summer before easing slightly as part of a normal late-year depreciation cycle.  At the start of this year, Chesbrough said, he thought higher loan rates would chase away buyers from both the new and used markets. Instead, robust demand from affluent buyers for pricey late-model used vehicles has strengthened sales in the United States.  Many of these buyers are paying cash to avoid higher interest rates. Edmunds.com says the average loan rate on a used vehicle is now 11.3%, up from 8.1% when the Fed started raising rates a year ago.  Because demand is intense and vehicle supplies short, Chesbrough doesn't foresee sales dropping even if the economy were to slide into a recession. Though many buyers with lower credit scores have left the market, sales remain solid.  With used-car inventories likely to remain crimped for the foreseeable future, Chesbrough doesn't expect prices to ever fall back to near their pre-pandemic levels   We just haven't been creating enough personal transportation in the last couple of years,  Chesbrough said."}, {"source": "associated-press", "title": "9 killed in Army Black Hawk helicopter crash in Kentucky", "text": "Nine people were killed in a crash involving two Army Black Hawk helicopters conducting a nighttime training exercise in Kentucky.

Nine people were killed in a crash involving two Army Black Hawk helicopters conducting a nighttime training exercise in Kentucky.  This is a truly tragic loss for our families, our division and Fort Campbell,  said Brig. Gen. John Lubas.  FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. (AP) -- U.S. Army investigators are trying to determine what caused two Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopters to crash during a routine nightime training exercise in Kentucky, killing all nine soldiers aboard. No one was hurt on the ground.  Nondice Thurman, a spokesperson for Fort Campbell, said the deaths happened Wednesday night in southwestern Kentucky during a routine training mission.  A statement from Fort Campbell said the two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, part of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed around 10 p.m. Wednesday in Trigg County in southwest Kentucky. The 101st Airborne confirmed the crash about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Fort Campbell.  One helicopter had five people aboard and the other had four, Brig. Gen. John Lubas, the 101st Airborne deputy commander, said Thursday. The helicopters crashed in a field near a residential area with no injuries on the ground, Lubas said.  An Army spokesperson declined to comment on whether the helicopters collided in the air.   At this time, there is no determination on the specifics regarding the accident,  Daniel Matthews, a public affairs officer for the 101st Airborne Division, said in an emailed statement Thursday afternoon. Matthews said an aviation safety team from Fort Rucker, Alabama, will investigate the accident.  Lubas said it is unclear what caused the crash.   This was a training progression, and specifically they were flying a multi-ship formation, two ships, under night vision goggles at night,  Lubas said. He said officials believe the accident occurred when  they were doing flying, not deliberate medical evacuation drills.   The helicopters have something similar to the black boxes on passenger planes, which records the performance of aircrafts in flight and are used by investigators to analyze crashes.   We're hopeful that will provide quite a bit of information of what occurred,  Lubas said.  Speaking a news conference Thursday morning, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the state would do everything it can to support the families of those killed.   We're going to do what we always do. We're going to wrap our arms around these families, and we're going to be there with them, not just for the days, but the weeks and the months and the years to come,  Beshear said.  The Black Hawk helicopter is a critical workhorse for the U.S. Army and is used in security, transport, medical evacuations, search and rescue and other missions. The helicopters are known to many people from the 2001 movie  Black Hawk Down,  which is about a violent battle in Somalia eight years earlier.  Black Hawks were a frequent sight in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan during the wars conducting combat missions and are also used by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. They were also often used to ferry visiting senior leaders to headquarters locations in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones.  Fort Campbell is located near the Tennessee border, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Nashville, and the crash occurred in the Trigg County, Kentucky, community of Cadiz.  Nick Tomaszewski, who lives about a mile from where the crash occurred, said he saw two helicopters flying over his house moments before the crash.   For whatever reason last night my wife and I were sitting there looking out on the back deck and I said 'Wow, those two helicopters look low and they look kind of close to one another tonight,'  he said.  The helicopters flew over and looped back around and moments later  we saw what looked like a firework went off in the sky.    All of the lights in their helicopter went out. It was like they just poofed ... and then we saw a huge glow like a fireball,  Tomaszewski said.  Flyovers for training exercises happen almost daily and the helicopters typically fly low but not so close together, he said.   There were two back to back. We typically see one and then see another one a few minutes later, and we just saw two of them flying together last night,  he said.  U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin offered his condolences to the families of those killed.   My heart goes out to the families of these servicemembers and to the members of the 101st Airborne Division who bravely and proudly serve our country each and every day,  Lloyd said in a statement.  In the Kentucky House and in the Senate, members stood for a moment of silence Thursday morning in honor of the crash victims. Kentucky state Rep. Walker Thomas said the crash occurred about 15 to 20 minutes from his home.   They're there to protect us,  Thomas said.  And we're constantly seeing these helicopters flying over our communities.   Thomas spoke about how connected Fort Campbell soldiers and their families are to the communities near the Army post.   The Fort Campbell soldiers that live in our communities, go to our churches ... they go to our schools, their kids do,  he added.  And this really hurts.   By Thursday morning, word of the crash was spreading through the community of Clarksville, Tennessee, just outside Fort Campbell.  Chaterra Watts, a former Army soldier who was stationed at Fort Campbell from about 2015 to 2019, said once she heard about the crash, she jumped on social media to try to find out more and if she knew any of the victims.   I pray for their friends and their families and just hope that we can all come together as a community and that something positive will come out of something so tragic,  Watts said.

(AP Photo/Gregorio Borgia, File)  VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican on Thursday responded to Indigenous demands and formally repudiated the  Doctrine of Discovery,  the theories backed by 15th-century  papal bulls  that legitimized the colonial-era seizure of Native lands and form the basis of some property laws today.  A Vatican statement said the papal bulls, or decrees,  did not adequately reflect the equal dignity and rights of Indigenous peoples  and have never been considered expressions of the Catholic faith.  The statement, from the Vatican's development and education offices, marked a historic recognition of the Vatican's own complicity in colonial-era abuses committed by European powers. It was issued under history's first Latin American pontiff, who was hospitalized Thursday with a respiratory infection, exactly one year after Francis met at the Vatican with Indigenous leaders from Canada who raised the issue.  ADVERTISEMENT  On Thursday, these Indigenous leaders welcomed the statement as a first good step, even though it didn't address the rescinding of the bulls themselves and continued to take distance from acknowledging actual Vatican culpability in abuses. The statement said the papal documents had been  manipulated  for political purposes by competing colonial powers  to justify immoral acts against Indigenous peoples that were carried out, at times, without opposition from ecclesial authorities.   It said it was right to  recognize these errors,  acknowledge the terrible effects of colonial-era assimilation policies on Indigenous peoples and ask for their forgiveness.  The statement was a response to decades of Indigenous demands for the Vatican to formally rescind the papal bulls that provided the Portuguese and Spanish kingdoms the religious backing to expand their territories in Africa and the Americas for the sake of spreading Christianity.  Those decrees underpin the  Doctrine of Discovery,  a legal concept coined in a 1823 U.S. Supreme Court decision that has come to be understood as meaning that ownership and sovereignty over land passed to Europeans because they  discovered  it.  It was cited as recently as a 2005 Supreme Court decision involving the Oneida Indian Nation written by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  ADVERTISEMENT  During Pope Francis' 2022 visit to Canada, where he apologized to Indigenous peoples for the residential school system that forcibly removed Native children from their homes, he was met with demands for a formal repudiation of the papal bulls .  Two Indigenous women unfurled a banner at the altar of the National Shrine of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupre on July 29 that read:  Rescind the Doctrine  in bright red and black letters.  Before that, Michelle Schenandoah of the Oneida Nation had called for the Vatican to rescind the papal bulls when she delivered the closing remarks of the First Nations delegation that met with Francis during a weeklong visit last year by Native groups from Canada. On Thursday, she called the Vatican statement  another step in the right direction,  but noted that it didn't mention the rescinding of the bulls themselves.  ADVERTISEMENT   I think what this does is it really puts the responsibility on nation states such as the United States, to look at its use of the Doctrine of Discovery,  she said in a interview from Syracuse, New York, where she is a professor of Indigenous law at Syracuse University's College of Law.  This goes beyond land. It really has created generation upon generation of genocidal policies directed towards Indigenous peoples. And I think that it's time for these governments to take full accountability for their actions.   In the statement, the Vatican said:  The Catholic Church therefore repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political 'doctrine of discovery.'   Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada who was also part of the First Nations delegation that met with Francis at the Vatican, said the statement was  wonderful,  resolved an outstanding issue and now puts the matter to civil authorities to revise property laws that cite the doctrine.  ADVERTISEMENT   The church has done one thing, as it said it would do, for the Holy Father. Now the ball is in the court of governments, the United States and in Canada, but particularly in the United States where the doctrine is embedded in the law,  he told The Associated Press.  The Vatican offered no evidence that the three papal bulls (Dum Diversas in 1452, Romanus Pontifex in 1455 and Inter Caetera in 1493) had themselves been formally abrogated, rescinded or rejected, as Vatican officials have often said. But it cited a subsequent bull, Sublimis Deus in 1537, that reaffirmed that Indigenous peoples shouldn't be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, and were not to be enslaved.  Cardinal Michael Czerny, the Canadian Jesuit whose office co-authored the statement, stressed that the original bulls had long ago been abrogated and that the use of the term  doctrine  -- which in this case is a legal term, not a religious one -- had led to centuries of confusion about the church's role.  ADVERTISEMENT  The original bulls, he said,  are being treated as if they were teaching, magisterial or doctrinal documents, and they are an ad hoc political move. And I think to solemnly repudiate an ad hoc political move is to generate more confusion than clarity.   He stressed that the statement wasn't just about setting the historical record straight, but  to discover, identify, analyze and try to overcome what we can only call the enduring effects of colonialism today.   It was significant that the repudiation of the  Doctrine of Discovery  came during the pontificate of history's first Latin American pope. Even before the Canadian trip, the Argentine pope had apologized to Native peoples in Bolivia in 2015 for the crimes of the colonial-era conquest of the Americas.  Felix Hoehn, a property and administrative law professor at the University of Saskatchewan, said the Vatican statement would have no legal bearing on land claims in Canada today, but would have symbolic value.   The most that any papal repudiation of the doctrine (or the bulls, for that matter) can do in relation to Canadian law is to apply pressure on the Supreme Court of Canada to renounce the doctrine as part of Canadian law,  he said.  Beyond that, though, is the hope that the statement could show that the Catholic Church wants to be an ally with Indigenous peoples as they fight for their human rights and their land, and to protect it, said the Rev. David McCallum, an American Jesuit who has worked with Indigenous peoples in the Syracuse area and was consulted during the drafting of the statement.

Board members on Wednesday, March 8, 2023, faced calls for better firefighter equipment, lessons on public records requests and bond ratings. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)  LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Board members picked by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to oversee the governance of Walt Disney World said Wednesday that their Disney-controlled predecessors pulled a fast one on them by passing restrictive covenants that strip the new board of many of its powers.  The current supervisors of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District said at a meeting that their predecessors last month signed a development agreement with the company that gave Disney maximum developmental power over the theme park resort's 27,000 acres in central Florida.  The five supervisors were appointed by the Republican governor to the board after the Florida Legislature overhauled Disney's government in retaliation for the entertainment giant publicly opposing so-called  Don't Say Gay  legislation that bars instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as well as lessons deemed not age-appropriate.  ADVERTISEMENT  In taking on Disney, DeSantis furthered his reputation as a culture warrior willing to battle perceived political enemies and wield the power of state government to accomplish political goals, a strategy that is expected to continue ahead of his potential White House run.  The new supervisors replaced a board that had been controlled by Disney during the previous 55 years that the government operated as the Reedy Creek Improvement District. The new board members held their first meeting earlier this month and said they found out about the agreement after their appointments.   We're going to have to deal with it and correct it,  board member Brian Aungst said Wednesday.  It's a subversion of the will of the voters and the Legislature and the governor. It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern.   Under the terms of the agreement, the district is prohibited from using the name  Disney  or any symbols associated with the theme park resort without the company's permission, nor can it use the likeness of Mickey Mouse, other Disney characters or other intellectual property in any manner. The company can sue for damages for any violations, and the agreement is in effect until perpetuity, according to the declaration.  If the agreement is deemed to violate rules against perpetuity, it will be in effect until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of England's King Charles III, the declaration said.  In a statement, Disney said all agreements were above board and took place in public.  ADVERTISEMENT   All agreements signed between Disney and the District were appropriate, and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine law,  the statement said.  Separately, Disney World service workers on Wednesday voted to accept a union contract offer that raises the starting minimum wage to $18 an hour by the end of the year.   Our cast members have always been at the heart of the Walt Disney World experience, and we are thrilled that, with the support of the union, they have overwhelmingly approved this new five-year agreement that significantly increases wages, alongside our leading benefits program that includes affordable medical coverage and more,  Walt Disney World Resort president Jeff Vahle said in a statement.  Frontline employees also have access to 100 percent paid tuition for higher education through the Disney Aspire program.   The agreement covers around 45,000 service workers at the Disney theme park resort, including costumed performers who perform as Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, bus drivers, culinary workers, lifeguards, theatrical workers and hotel housekeepers.  Workers will see their hourly wages rise between $5.50 and $8.60 an hour by the end of the five-year contract, according to union leaders.  A contract approved five years ago made Disney the first major employer in central Florida to agree to a minimum hourly wage of $15, setting the trend for other workers in the region dominated by hospitality jobs."}, {"source": "bbc-news", "title": "Seven California officers charged with manslaughter in traffic stop death", "text": "When Mr Bronstein refuses to comply, the video shows several officers forcing him down to a mat on the floor while he is handcuffed.

Embora o humorista ja tivesse concordado em ter filhos, ele mudou de ideia apos uma viagem a Portugal no final de 2021.

(AP) -- Professors at the New College of Florida are using personal email because they're afraid of being subpoenaed.  Students are concerned, too. Some fear for their physical safety. Many worry their teachers will be fired en masse and their courses and books will be policed. It's increasingly hard to focus on their studies.  For years, students have come to this public liberal arts college on the western coast of Florida because they were self-described free thinkers . Now they find themselves caught in the crosshairs of America's culture war.  Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has targeted the tiny school on the shores of Sarasota Bay as a staging ground for his war on  woke.  The governor and his allies say New College, a progressive school with a prominent LGBTQ+ community, is indoctrinating students with leftist ideology and should be revamped into a more conservative institution.  Students and faculty say America should take note because the transformation at New College could become a blueprint with national implications as DeSantis gears up for a likely presidential bid .   I'm sorry, but this isn't an indoctrination facility. This isn't a factory that pumps out, you know, non-binary communists,  says Viv Cargille, 20, a marine biology major from Miami. She is passionate about researching dolphin acoustics but finds it mentally exhausting to focus on classes in a climate she describes as turbulent, volatile and anxiety-inducing.  Her roommate Olivia Pare, a second-year biology major, wishes the politicians would leave their school alone.  My biggest frustration is the way it is impacting my education. I am here to learn. I am not here to be more woke -- whatever that is,  Pare said. When she does research in the organic chemistry lab,  we're not talking about organic chemistry anymore -- we're talking about whether my professor will get her tenure approved.   In January, DeSantis and his allies overhauled the 13-member Board of Trustees and installed a majority of conservative figures. The new trustees promptly fired the college president and replaced her with a Republican politician, the first of several administrators to lose their jobs. Next, they dismantled the office of diversity and equity . They have not revealed future plans but trustees have posted vague warnings on social media like:  You will see changes in 120 days.   Changes so far have come in tandem with a new bill DeSantis unveiled Jan. 31 aimed at overhauling higher education in Florida. The bill would ban gender studies majors and minors, eliminate diversity programs and any hiring based on diversity, weaken tenure protections and put all hiring decisions in the hands of each university's board of trustees.  The effect at New College has been chilling and disruptive. Students and faculty compare the upheaval to a  hostile takeover  that feels even more jarring because of what the school has represented to so many students for so many years: a haven of open-mindedness and acceptance in a place of idyllic beauty, with palm-tree-lined paths along a stretch of white-sand coast.   It felt very much like New College was a little bubble in Florida,  said Willem Aspinall, 19, an environmental studies major who grew up in a Chicago suburb.  Now it feels like that has kind of been burst. The campus feels a lot less safe now.   Students and faculty are afraid of one thing most of all: The extinction of New College as they know it.  They are not wrong to worry.  One of the new trustees is Christopher Rufo, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and architect of the right-wing outrage against critical race theory , a legal term that has come to represent teaching about the ongoing effects of slavery. Rufo actively posts on social media about his vision for the future of New College, often in militaristic terms. He has referred to new trustees at the public institution as the  landing team,  saying,  We got over the wall,  and referencing an operation to  recapture  the college.  New College has its problems. The college performs poorly in certain state metrics, including a decline in enrollment until last year. Students complain of mold in dorms, broken elevators and other delayed maintenance because of years of underfunding. Some students say they would welcome more conservative students to balance the left-leaning student body. DeSantis and the new trustees cite the challenges as justification for the state intervention.   We will be shutting down low-performing, ideologically-captured academic departments and hiring new faculty,  Rufo said in one tweet.  The student body will be recomposed over time: some current students will self-select out, others will graduate; we'll recruit new students who are mission-aligned.  He and others have posted plans to  redesign the curriculum  with a goal of making the school more politically conservative.  Some students are fleeing, for schools that feel safer. Many on campus have voiced a concern that the politically charged spotlight on their school could invite danger. Several professors who asked not to be named are sending out resumes. Trustee meetings have become a focal point of student protests, and the only source of information on the school's fate.  New College has long been an anomaly in a state filled with large public universities. It has barely 700 students, no fraternities or sororities and no football team. It is Florida's designated honors college and produces an impressive number of the state's Fulbright scholars. It has a uniquely self-directed curriculum that allows students to design individualized majors. The average class size is 11 students. There are no letter grades; students get detailed  narrative evaluations  as part of a pass-fail system.  The academic freedom is mirrored by a student body that feels free to express itself, say students and faculty, who describe New College as a haven for brainy kids who are high-achieving and intellectually curious. Some were the quiet kids in high school, or were bullied for being queer or different, or struggled socially because of autism or other disabilities. Some were homeschooled or come from alternative educational backgrounds that led them to be self-directed in their schooling. They arrived at New College and felt welcome in a way they never had before, say parents, students and faculty.  There is a long table in the center of the New College dining hall that epitomizes the school's culture of acceptance, according to several students. People sitting there invite newcomers to come join them. Anyone walking in knows they never need to eat alone.   It is one of the most unique places I think that exists in American higher education,  says Elizabeth C. Leininger, a neuroscientist and associate biology professor, who knows all her students by name. She compares an education at New College to small, private liberal arts schools at a fraction of the cost. In-state tuition at New College is $7,000 and out-of-state is $30,000, but many students get scholarships that cut tuition by at least half.  For the first time in her academic career, Leininger is wondering if some of her courses, like  Sex, Gender, Mind and Brain,  will court trouble.   I would have to think very carefully about how I am going to teach that class now,  said Leininger, a graduate of Swarthmore College who did her Ph.D. at Columbia University, where she also taught. Like other faculty, Leininger is using personal email or encrypted messaging platforms when discussing the upheaval, fearing school email accounts will be subpoenaed.  There is very much a policing of ideas.   Students, too, have shifted conversations on organizing protests to encrypted platforms like Signal and Slack to ensure privacy, says Gaby Batista, 19, an anthropology major who has taken personal precautions as well.  I've made my Instagram private and took off my pronouns.   For parents who have felt the intense heartache of watching their child struggle and then the deep relief of seeing them thrive, the upheaval at New College is making them relive a painful past.  Psychologist Joyce White calls the experience  devastating  and  destabilizing  for the parents and students, particularly those who endured childhood bullying only to find themselves again feeling targeted. White's daughter, Lola, is a third-year biology major at New College with plans to be a veterinarian. Lola is autistic, has ADHD and  lives in a constant state of anxiety,  her mother said. Ever since she was a child, Lola excelled at school but found it very stressful. She has difficulty adapting to change and feeling like she belongs. Until fifth grade, Lola threw up every day on the way to school, her mother said. The pandemic wreaked havoc on her mental health and disrupted Lola's college plans. She attended community college online for two years, before transferring in the fall of 2022 to New College.   We found this little school that was perfect for Lola,  said White, who moved her family from Minnesota to Sarasota to ease Lola into college. It wasn't easy at first, adjusting to the Florida heat and to in-person classes, but Lola was settling in. She loved her small classes at New College and the ability to meet professors one-on-one. Her confidence was growing, which made her less introverted. She felt safe, and one day she joked with another student that she had no friends. The student responded,  You're our friend,  and invited Lola to study with her group at the library.   I felt like I could connect to the people here. The kids are accepting - of anyone. There is no judgment,  said Lola. She was amazed at the resources the school offered to help students who were struggling. She was assigned an academic adviser, a career coach and a special adviser for transfer students.  When I told them I was struggling, they reached out even more. No one has ever done that for me before in education,  Lola said, seated beside her mother at sunset on a recent evening along the school's private beach.   It's been such a long road, and I finally felt like I could see light at the end of the tunnel,  said White, who recognizes in herself feelings of anxiety and depression as she worries if Lola will find her path again.  Now it feels like everything has blown up.  She adds,  I'm trying to put on a brave face for her.   Two of Lola's friends are transferring out of New College. Lola has struggled lately with panic attacks, stress and difficulty concentrating on schoolwork. But for now, she plans to stay.  I can do it, but there will be repercussions on my mental health.   Meanwhile, students and faculty are noticing new restrictions they worry are aimed at curtailing freedom of expression. Faculty received a memo recently with new recommended guidelines for email signatures: They  should only include  name, title, college address, logo and phone number, which faculty see as a ruling that disallows pronouns. An event known as V.I.P. Weekend that was organized by the diversity and equity office to host prospective students overnight was also abruptly canceled. And maintenance crews recently were instructed to wash away chalk drawings and messages that covered a campus overpass, part of a longstanding tradition of eclectic artwork and expression. Many of the chalk messages voiced outrage at DeSantis and the new trustees or carried messages of support, such as:  Diversity is our strength.   Faculty are advising students to concentrate on schoolwork and block out the noise, but it's hard to shake the feeling that the worst is yet to come, said Aspinall, the environmental studies major.   I'm concerned they're going to take a school that does not indoctrinate students and turn it into a school that does.   ___  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

Recentemente, a Justica decidiu que a cantora Lexa pode ter o seu dinheiro bloqueado por uma divida do seu marido, o funkeiro MC Guime. O valor da divida e referente a um processo no qual Guime foi condenado por nao pagar os advogados da parte vencedora em uma acao contra os donos de um imovel comprado em Alphaville em 2016.  De acordo com a decisao dos desembargadores, ate 30% dos rendimentos mensais de Lexa podem ser penhorados para pagar a divida. E importante ressaltar que o dinheiro da cantora ainda nao foi bloqueado, pois cabe recurso e ela pretende recorrer da decisao.  O que chama a atencao nesta situacao e que a Justica considerou Lexa responsavel pela divida dos honorarios, ja que ela e casada com Guime em comunhao universal de bens. Alem disso, o bloqueio inclui o que o casal ganha com streaming das musicas de ambos.  Guime pede que Lexa nao seja cobrada pela divida  Guime, por sua vez, pediu que Lexa nao seja cobrada, alegando que se trata de uma  divida contraida antes do matrimonio . Ele tambem solicitou que seus saldos bancarios sejam desbloqueados.  A advogada de Lexa, Marcella Soller, tambem argumentou que a cantora nao tem responsabilidade pela divida, pois os fatos do processo sao anteriores ao casamento com MC Guime.  Advogada de Lexa pretende recorrer da decisao da Justica  A situacao se agrava ainda mais quando lembramos que Guime esta envolvido em outra divida, referente ao nao pagamento das parcelas de um imovel que ele comprou em 2016. A divida total chega a cerca de R$ 2,9 milhoes. O advogado da parte vencedora do processo contra Guime pelas custas do processo processou novamente o funkeiro, que foi condenado mais uma vez e agora e cobrado pelos R$ 421 mil em aberto.  Essa quantia em aberto e a que esta sendo cobrada de Lexa. Alem disso, o cache e os premios de Guime no  BBB23  tambem foram penhorados para ajudar a quitar a divida.  Termino do casamento  O termino do relacionamento entre Lexa e MC Guime aconteceu apos o episodio polemico no  BBB23 , onde o funkeiro foi expulso junto com outro participante, acusados de importunacao sexual contra a mexicana Dania Mendez, selecionada para um intercambio na competicao.  Ja no inicio de 2023, a cantora foi flagrada sem alianca em um shopping e revelou ter sofrido uma crise de amnesia em decorrencia do episodio envolvendo MC Guime no programa da TV Globo.  Separados, mas nem tanto  Vale lembrar que esta nao foi a primeira vez que o casal enfrentou problemas em seu relacionamento. Em outubro de 2022, Lexa e MC Guime anunciaram publicamente a separacao, mas reataram o relacionamento em dezembro do mesmo ano. No entanto, apos a expulsao do funkeiro do  BBB23 , Lexa decidiu dar um ponto final definitivo em seu casamento com MC Guime.

That clears a path for Vaughn to return to his natural position after he's been forced to learn outfield on the fly over the past two years. The 24-year-old is just scratching the surface of his potential, and his value should skyrocket with his defensive shortcomings in the outfield not dragging things down.  Cleveland Guardians: Hunter Gaddis is latest homegrown rotation standout  The Guardians have done as well as any team in baseball in developing pitching talent in recent years, and Gaddis could be their next gem. The 6'6  right-hander had a 4.01 ERA, 1.08 WHIP and 158 strikeouts in 121.1 innings in the minors last year, and with Triston McKenzie headed to the injured list, Gaddis will start the year in the Cleveland rotation. Don't be surprised if he takes that opportunity and runs with it.  Detroit Tigers: Javier Baez is traded at the deadline  Baez is entering the second season of a six-year, $140 million deal, but his contract contains an opt-out following next offseason. The 30-year-old was still a 2.6 WAR player last season even while struggling at the plate for much of the year, and with a bounce-back offensively, he could be a hot commodity this summer. Opting out of his deal with a struggling Tigers team makes sense, but he might be convinced to opt-in with a move to a contender.  Kansas City Royals: Brady Singer earns AL Cy Young votes  Singer emerged as the ace of the staff in Kansas City last season, finishing 10-5 with a 3.23 ERA, 1.14 WHIP and 150 strikeouts in 153.1 innings, and that performance earned him a spot on Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.

Minnesota Twins: Edouard Julien will be an everyday player by June  Julien hit .300/.441/.490 with 39 extra-base hits and 19 steals in 113 games at Double-A last season and then batted a ridiculous .400/.563/.686 over 96 plate appearances in the Arizona Fall League.

They went even further by signing shortstop Xander Bogaerts in free agency and extending Manny Machado and Yu Darvish to ensure they are key parts of the team's future.  It will be quite the turn seeing the Padres supplant the Dodgers as the class of the NL West for the first time in more than a decade.  San Diego has the best lineup in the NL, maybe even across all of baseball. Its pitching is finally solid enough to help it take that next step.  Getting Fernando Tatis Jr. back this year will help, too.  Prediction: 97-65  Los Angeles Dodgers  Last Year's Record: 111-51  Over/Under: 95.5  The biggest anticipated drop-off across the game is with the Dodgers, which have been a staple of National League dominance for the better part of a decade.  They lost key pieces in Trea Turner and Justin Turner, and they just decided they no longer wanted Cody Bellinger.  The loss of Justin Turner likely places Max Muncy at third base, but does anyone feel like they adequately addressed these departures?  J.D. Martinez should be a fine designated hitter. The Dodgers should be a fine team, but they won't have those best-record-in-baseball and highest-run-differential vibes from last year.  Prediction: 93-69  San Francisco Giants  Last Year's Record: 81-81  Over/Under: 81.5  So close, but so far. That about sums up the Giants' offseason.  Aaron Judge flirted with them before ultimately deciding to return to the Yankees. Carlos Correa looked like he'd play there until concerns were raised about a surgically repaired ankle from his minor-league days.  Even Carlos Rodon seemed like a candidate to return until he, too, chose The Bronx over The Bay.  The Giants' key free-agent signings are Michael Conforto, who did not play last season, Sean Manaea, Ross Stripling, Mitch Haniger and Taylor Rogers. There is still a serious question mark at catcher, an offseason need the Giants did not exactly address.  This is once again a team that's too good to bottom out but still nowhere near the Padres or Dodgers.  Prediction: 74-88  Arizona Diamondbacks  Last Year's Record: 74-88  Over/Under: 75.5  Even in a division with heavyweights, the Diamondbacks have to feel pretty good about themselves in 2023.  They showed significant improvement from 2021 to 2022, and now there is actual optimism. The confidence is there with legitimate Cy Young candidate Zac Gallen leading the way alongside Madison Bumgarner, Merrill Kelly and Zach Davies.  Infielders Ketel Marte and Christian Walker are names you've heard, but NL Rookie of the Year candidate Corbin Carroll will also be in the mix.  Arizona is looking to continue developing its young players while contending for a Wild Card berth this season.  Prediction: 77-85  Colorado Rockies  Last Year's Record: 68-94  Over/Under: 65.5  The Rockies signed Jurickson Profar after the World Baseball Classic, and it was arguably their best offseason move.  Not much else needs to be said from there. This was a 68-win team last year that did virtually nothing to improve its chances of winning more games.  The Rockies can at least hope Year 2 of the Kris Bryant experiences is more productive than Year 1 when he played just 42 games.  Prediction: 62-100"}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "How Labor depicts the gas industry as both carbon villain and energy savious", "text": " Gas is absolutely essential for energy-intensive projects such as extraction, concentration and processing of critical minerals and rare earth elements. These are the minerals that are central to the energy transition.   Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also recently emphasised his strong support for the continued key role for gas despite Labor's ambitious emissions reduction targets.  Yet, the gas industry is distinctly unsettled by Labor's obvious willingness to add to costs and uncertainty of further development with a range of simultaneous, compounding measures.  This includes producers' difficult negotiations with departments and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over how a  reasonable pricing  regime for gas can actually work in practice. Some planned gas developments and even expansion of existing projects have already been put on indefinite hold.  It's likely to be another month until details of the package are completed with little industry faith in the outcome. Despite protracted discussions about trade-offs and the risks involved, the industry knows Canberra wants to claim a substantial difference to consumer costs. The government certainly won't acknowledge any veracity in industry warnings that such intervention will harm future investment and supply, instead arguing it merely ensures no price gouging or  profiteering .  So far, the government is confident the public remains on side - particularly given the industry's tarnished reputation, making it an easy target as it is blamed for both high carbon emissions and power bills.  Advertisement  So, the industry was prepared to live with Labor's imposition of a one-year, $12 price cap on wholesale gas contracts - especially as the current spot price is below that despite not being covered by the cap.  But gas producers are alarmed by the prospect of indefinite provisions for embedded government control of pricing and choice of customers under the proposed new code of conduct.  The results of all this should be out just in time for the May 9 budget and the likely realisation of industry fears that Treasurer Jim Chalmers will also decide the current level of profits for many gas producers offers an irresistible target for raising tax revenue.  As The Australian Financial Review economics editor John Kehoe explains, an originally limited review of the petroleum resource rent tax has turned into a lever for a far more extensive overhaul of the regime aimed at dramatically increasing the tax take.  That will increase industry complaints that it's being unfairly and unrealistically targeted by a government failing to come to grips with the complexity of the massive, long-term investment decisions required.  Not that industry ire is restricted to Labor or the Greens. The business community is furious with the Liberals over their refusal to engage with the government about changes to the safeguard mechanism despite the scheme's genesis under the Coalition government.  Advertisement  The stand-off forced Labor to negotiate with the Greens instead to ensure the bill's passage in the Senate, leading to various concessions vague enough to allow the Greens to claim victory of sorts.  Energy Minister Chris Bowen boasts the Greens have not succeeded in their goal of banning any new coal or gas projects. Yet, the apparently strict conditions on zero net carbon emissions from Day 1 will - at a minimum - further complicate and delay development of several new gas projects and possibly expansion of existing fields to service new projects.  King will certainly have had intense conversations over her Thursday lunch with key gas producers about the difference between enthusiastic statements of support for the industry compared to the chaotic impact of the government's accumulated new measures.  Her guests included the chief executive of Japan's Inpex, Takayuki Ueda, for example, who has been keen to stress the importance of energy security in the region and policy stability in Australia.  Such concern is hardly surprising given Inpex's joint ownership of the Ichthys LNG processing facility in Darwin supplying customers in Japan and the rest of Asia. The project planned to backfill diminishing reserves from off the WA coast by developing the adjacent Plover reservoir adjacent. Plover may now be counted as a new field with high carbon content, captured by safeguard mechanism provisions and requiring carbon capture and storage or carbon offsets at additional cost.  Then there are reforms to the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism starting this week. This shifts the ability to curb LNG exports from Queensland in case of a domestic shortfall from an annual event into a quarterly determination.  Advertisement  The government is assuring nervous customers and governments in countries like Japan and Korea it won't lead to abrogation of existing contracts but, amazingly, the industry had to wait till late Thursday for guidelines on the new regime.  It all means the combination of new policies with uncertainty about their application and extent has much of the gas industry in a state of shocked confusion.

Major companies such as Woodside Energy, Santos and Shell and their tax advisers have signed confidentiality agreements with Treasury on the PRRT consultation.  Treasurer Jim Chalmers has said Treasury is conducting a review of the PRRT. Rhett Wyman  The work started as a targeted and technical review of so-called gas transfer pricing rules for PRRT projects in offshore federal waters, which began under the Morrison government after a report it commissioned found loopholes.  Since Treasury resumed the stalled work for Labor late last year, it has cast the net wider to probe other PRRT areas, such as deductions, in an attempt to raise revenue sooner for the government from the profits-based tax.  Advertisement   They're trying to find a way to bring the PRRT receipts forward,  a source familiar with the discussions said.  The timing of any changes remains unclear, but the May 9 budget is shaping as a likely trigger point.  Most LNG will never pay PRRT  The October budget forecast the PRRT to raise $2.6 billion in 2022-23 and a little over $2 billion annually in subsequent years.   PRRT receipts are expected to fall from their peak in 2022-23, as production in maturing fields (including in the Bass Strait) declines and the prices of oil and gas stabilise,  Treasury noted in the budget.  Under the current tax rules, energy industry analysts say if the long-term oil price reverts to $US60 to $US70 a barrel, most liquified natural gas projects will never pay PRRT.  Advertisement  The global oil benchmark, Brent crude, was trading at about $US75 a barrel on Thursday. The movement in gas prices is closely linked to the oil price.  Citi head of energy James Byrne said potential changes to the PRRT in the federal budget was a  key concern  for investors.   We see Woodside as most exposed, given a higher proportion of EBIT [earnings before interest and tax] is from Australian offshore operations,  he said.  Dr Chalmers' language on potential changes to the PRRT has evolved, as energy profits soar due to the war in Ukraine driving up gas and coal prices and the federal budget coming under sustained spending pressures.  Dr Chalmers last June ruled out any immediate changes to the PRRT.  Advertisement  But in late October he revealed Treasury would reopen work into the PRRT and said,  I know a lot of people would rather that went up a lot more.   Energy companies typically pay the corporate tax rate of up to 30 per cent on profits before paying any PRRT, but many oil and gas companies pay no or limited PRRT due to tax write-offs for huge capital expenditure.  The 40 per cent PRRT is levied on offshore oil and gas projects once they become cash flow positive - which often takes many years or decades because project building and operation costs are fully deductible upfront.  The combined total tax rate of company tax and PRRT is theoretically up to 58 per cent, allowing for deductions.  Economists such as Chris Richardson have called on the government to strengthen the PRRT to collect more revenue from gas exporters, to help pay for assistance to households.  Mark Hatfield, managing director in Australia for Chevron, which operates the huge Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG ventures in Australia, said last year the US major had some years when it paid little tax but would in future become a  ginormous  taxpayer as it recovered its investment costs.  Advertisement   Just this year we're going to be paying a pretty large tax bill; probably about $600 million. It's just where you are in the investment cycle,  he said last year.   What I would say is Chevron's contribution is well beyond directly paying taxes,  he added, describing the well-paying employee and contractor jobs its investments support and the indirect economic benefits as  huge .  Changes to the deductions  The Treasury consultation on gas transfer pricing rules for integrated PRRT projects began in April 2019 under the Coalition government, following recommendations by a PRRT review by former Treasury official Mike Callaghan in 2017.  The Coalition made some prospective changes to deny about $6 billion in future tax deductions over the next decade.  The so-called  uplift rate , which determines the level of exploration-related deductions that oil and gas ventures can carry forward into future years, was reduced from the long-term bond rate plus 15 percentage points to the long-term bond rate plus 5 percentage points. This reduced the compounding of deductions.  Advertisement  Onshore gas projects that Labor brought into the PRRT net in 2012 as part of its mining tax changes were also removed from the offshore oil and gas tax, to stop companies such as Shell, ConocoPhillips and Santos using them as deductions for their PRRT liabilities on offshore projects.  But the Callaghan report identified other potential reforms that the Coalition did not finish implementing.  The report said gas transfer pricing rules probably undervalued gas that was used in vertically integrated LNG or electricity generation projects compared to what an arm's-length market price for gas sales would be.  The undervaluation reduces the PRRT paid by integrated projects and Mr Callaghan called for it to be overhauled in line with international best practice set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Citi's Mr Byrne said in a note to clients:  We think the government will likely consider simplifying the upstream gas transfer pricing methodology for LNG projects to being solely on an LNG netback basis, which would increase the PRRT profit calculation.   The Callaghan report also recommended auditing companies to check that expenditure items with the highest uplifts were deducted first to reduce the impact of compounding over time."}, {"source": "australian-financial-review", "title": "Aston byelection: Lose this one, and the road back is even longer for the Libs", "text": "Earlier in the year, Coalition governments had been butchered in state elections in Western Australia and Queensland, and Howard lost the once blue-ribbon federal seat of Ryan in a byelection.

I believe that the government is well and truly back in the game,  Howard told the debut episode of the ABC's Insiders program, which went to air the day after the byelection.   If there were an unstoppable momentum for Labor to win the federal election, they'd have rolled us over in Aston.   It's still going to be a very hard fight for us to win the election, but those people who were saying that we were gone for all money are clearly wrong.   The Liberals copped a 3.7 per cent two-party-preferred swing against them in Aston to hang on with a 0.6 per cent margin.  Advertisement  No matter. As then opposition leader Anthony Albanese said after Labor held on for grim death to hold Eden-Monaro at the 2020 byelection,  a win is a win , and it's exactly what Dutton will say on Saturday night, if the Liberals hold Aston in the byelection triggered by the resignation of Alan Tudge.  For the Liberals, the stakes in Aston are not as high as they may have been in 2001, given the next election is still two years away, and the Coalition, in opposition, is unlikely to win that anyway.  Balance of power  Nor will Saturday's outcome affect the balance of power in the House of Representatives.  But for the purposes of lifting morale and seeding hope in the Liberal Party, which is now in opposition everywhere except Tasmania, it is critical.  A government has not won a seat from an opposition in a federal byelection since 1920. And that was an exceptional circumstance.

At the May 2022 federal election, the unpopularity of Scott Morrison, which was especially pronounced in Victoria, and personal controversy surrounding Tudge, combined to engineer a 7.3 per cent two-party swing against the Liberals in Aston, leaving the party holding the once safe seat by 2.8 per cent.  Peter Dutton with the Liberals' candidate for Aston, Roshena Campbell. Joe Armao  With Morrison and Tudge now out of the picture, the Liberals would be unlucky to suffer another swing on top of that 10 months ago. But they are worried. The party's primary vote remains dire in Victoria and its federal director, Andrew Hirst, and one of Dutton's senior advisers have been camped in the seat for the best part of the last month.  Dutton has been there four times and is due to visit again on Friday. Labor is making the opposition leader the focus of its campaign, urging voters to reject a  leftover  of the Morrison government and saying Aston deserves better.  The Liberals are focused on the cost of living, namely Labor's now undeliverable and never to be repeated promise to cut the average household power bill by $275 a year, and rising interest rates.  Advertisement  Aston is a mortgage belt seat from central casting with 41 per cent of homes having a mortgage, above the Victorian average of 36 per cent and the national average of 35 per cent.  These, along with small businesses and the regions, are the people that Dutton, upon assuming the leadership last year, said were central to the party's revival.   Our policies will be squarely aimed at the forgotten Australians in the suburbs across Australia,  he said.  To not pass the first test with this demographic would be soul-destroying.  Addressing his MPs at this week's party room meeting, Dutton said that although the cost of living was  really starting to bite  in Aston, the voters were not blaming the government.   The [government's] honeymoon is not quite over yet, and it's going to be close,  he said.  Advertisement  In other words, one of the married couple may have farted in bed and exploded some of the mystery, but they are still very much enamoured of each other.  The explosion inside the Victorian Liberals over state MP Moira Deeming attending an anti-transgender rally, which was also attended by neo-Nazis, was also most damaging, Dutton said, as if anyone needed a reminder.  Albanese is operating on the basis that the Liberals will squeak home and in doing so, engaged in some shameless sandbagging this week by telling caucus the average swing against a government in a byelection was 5 per cent to 6 per cent.  Leaked polling  Therefore,  anything less than that's a bad result for Peter Dutton . Which, as already mentioned, is not what Dutton will be saying after a close result and was not what Albanese said after he held Eden-Monaro by 735 votes.  Labor's polling leaked to Sky News on Thursday showed that in Aston, Dutton was about as popular as boils, but the Liberals were leading Labor by 52 per cent to 48 per cent.  Advertisement  A loss would not result in Dutton being dispatched as leader. The view within the party is that he is doing an admirable job holding the show together and anyway, there is no conceivable alternative.  But surely, it will force a rethink on strategy and policy direction.

Small business cannot afford this risk, and workers cannot afford the consequent reversal in full and part-time jobs. Restraint now ensures greater benefits in the longer term.

Advertisement  Labor cautions against broad CPI increases  Meanwhile, the Albanese government confirmed suggestions its submission would seek an inflation-matching wage rise for the 184,000 lowest-paid workers, drawing a distinction with higher award rates.   The Australian government recommends that the Fair Work Commission ensures the real wages of Australia's low-paid workers do not go backwards,  its submission will say.  However, Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Workplace Relations Minister Tony Burke cautioned that  our submission does not suggest that across-the-board wages should automatically increase in line with inflation, or that inflation is the only factor the FWC should consider .  Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said on Thursday the employer group would wait for further jobs and inflation data, as well as the May budget, before putting a figure on its wage claim.  But he slammed the ACTU's 7 per cent wage claim as  economically reckless and irresponsible  when inflation was slowing, and said his group would call on the FWC to exercise  restraint and caution .  Advertisement   [AiGroup's] submission will draw attention to the real risk that an excessive wage rise would tip Australia into recession,  Mr Willox said.   With both the Reserve Bank and the federal government pledging to 'do what it takes' to get inflation under control, a wage rise anywhere near the 7 per cent proposed by the ACTU would raise inflationary pressures and inflationary expectations.   He argued this would likely spark another round of interest rate rises, pressure the government to slow the economy with tax hikes and spending cuts and lead to cuts to jobs or hours.   This would be the recession that we didn't have to have.   University of Melbourne professor and labour economist Mark Wooden - a member of the minimum wage panel since 2020 but who has been benched for this year's decision - said he had expected the ACTU's claim to be at least 8 to 10 per cent.   I was surprised, I was surprised by how restrained they were,  he said.  Advertisement   There have been 13 wage decisions since [FWC was created in 2010] - with one exception - that have been at or above the rate of CPI annual increase as for March that year.    Really they're only asking for 7 [per cent] which isn't a lot more than inflation going to be , Professor Wooden said. The annual inflation rate dropped from 7.4 per cent to 6.8 per cent in February.  He also downplayed talk of a wage-price spiral from the increase given the decision was only once a year, unions  don't seem to be very effective anymore  and enterprise agreements tend to be locked in for three years.  But he rubbished the ACTU's arguments that the wage rise was affordable because of soaring corporate profits.   If you take 2022's four quarters then more than 50 per cent of those [firms] earning profits in the market sector were in mining. Only 1 per cent of workers in mining are on award wages,  he said.   Cafes and restaurants - a sector where 60 per cent of employers in that sector were on the award rate - [their] profits were 28 per cent below 2019. Their wage bill was up 8 per cent.   Advertisement  Cash rate would climb to 5pc  Judo Bank economist Warren Hogan said the ACTU's argument there was no risk of inflationary effects from its claim was flawed.   The reality is what central banks are worried about and have been for six months is that as pandemic-inflation shoots pass we're left with a domestic inflation problem largely driven by wages and other factors like energy prices,  he said.   Seven per cent is going to make it impossible for the Reserve Bank to get inflation down to its target [inflation of 2-3 per cent] - in fact make it all but impossible for the RBA to get inflation down to 5 to 6 per cent.   He said such inflation would make it  inevitable  that the cash rate would have to go from 3.6 per cent to above 5 per cent  and I think that will generate a recession and higher unemployment .  However, he said he saw a case for a minimum wage rise of 4 to 5 per cent, similar to last year, but that it would need to be accompanied by a FWC and government statement that  this is not the new normal .  Advertisement  ACTU secretary Sally McManus said 7 per cent did not mean a 7 per cent rise for everyone.   Last year the impact of a 5 per cent increase on overall wages was less than a third of 1 per cent,  she said.   So there is no chance whatsoever that it's going to cause overall wages to go up much at all - in fact, [it will only be] a very small amount.   She pointed to the United States, where she said pay overall was  up around 7 per cent and their overall inflation is coming down, just like it is all around the world - unsurprisingly, as it's got a lot to do with global supply chain issues, which every day are easing.

It is exciting. You don't get too many days like that,  Mr Goyder told The Australian Financial Review on Thursday.   But it all revolves around having good projects. It is about the assets in the ground. You always come through with the right assets.   The events of Tuesday pushed the value of his 15 per cent stake in Liontown to $844 million and his 11 per cent stake in Chalice, which also revealed a 50 per cent jump in the size of its Gonneville deposit to 3 million tonnes of nickel equivalent, to $226 million.  He was previously a paper billionaire in 2021 after a spike in the Liontown share price.  Mr Goyder would not discuss the specifics of the Albemarle bid for Liontown or what the board thought was a fair price for its lithium assets in WA, but did reflect on the company's journey from four employees less than two years ago.

It is very gratifying to see that.   Mr Goyder said a lot of those investors had become millionaires based on the value of the stock in the four years since Liontown uncovered what is now recognised as the world's fifth-biggest hard rock lithium discovery.  Market speculation  He was  keeping my feet firmly on the ground and focusing on the job at hand  as he declined to comment on criticism from Albemarle that the Liontown board should have taken its $2.50 offer to shareholders, amid market speculation that an offer of up to $3 might be looked on more favourably.  Liontown announced late on Thursday that Albemarle had increased its stake to 4.3 per cent, up from what Liontown understood to be a 2.2 per cent stake two days earlier. Charlotte-headquartered Albemarle has also requested a copy of the Liontown share register.  As to Chalice, Mr Goyder said the journey from founding the company in 2006 and then making a platinum group elements (PGE) discovery that included Australia's biggest undeveloped nickel sulphide deposit had been remarkable.  Advertisement   To have been successful in two companies and to have two companies in the ASX200 is pretty amazing,  he said.  Liontown's Kathleen Valley lithium project is about 60 kilometres north of Leinster in WA's remote northern Goldfields, and parts of Chalice's growing Julimar Project are on farmland within 70 kilometres of Perth.  Mr Goyder said finding such assets and progressing projects came down to having the  right team, the right shareholder base and a bit of luck .  Liontown's success started out in the exploration phase with a tight and capable exploration team.   After we had success with that [exploration], we then wanted to build up a management team capable of mining the project, and we have got that with our chief executive Tony Ottaviano,  he said.   He has built his team up, and we have some 200 people working for us now and this thing is happening.

Established lithium producer MinRes has warned US is making it attractive for companies such as Albemarle to buy up mines in Australia, and urged the government to respond before it is too late.  In a submission to the government and Treasury officials ahead of the federal budget, MinRes said the IRA had incentivised US companies to buy up Australian lithium and other battery minerals mines while investing in downstream processing elsewhere.  'Reach for the stars'  Mr Goyder said he had spent several days in Washington recently and was well aware of the implications of the IRA and what it would mean for Australia's downstream processing and battery making ambitions unless matched by similar incentives here.   Downstream is wanted in Australia, and it should be done in Australia but the incentives that the US government is giving out now through the IRA are outstanding,  he said.  Advertisement  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said last month he wanted Australia to move all the way downstream from mining to battery manufacturing.  Mr Goyder said Australia should aspire to battery making but needed to act fast.   Why not? Why not reach for the stars?  he said.   Australia has got to change its direction. What as a nation are we going to stand for? We have got the technical expertise. Around the world, Australians are working in all sorts of places and a lot of those will want to come back home.   My Goyder said Liontown had the same discussions as MinRes with government about grants and instant or accelerated tax write-offs to encourage downstream investment.   We too have had those conversations with government, and we are completely aligned [with MinRes],  he said.  These plants will go where the money is, that is natural.

Albemarle is unsure about another big downstream investment in WA after cost blowouts and delays at its Kemerton lithium hydroxide plant in the state's south-west.  Albemarle is thought to have spent more than $US1.5 billion on the first two production trains at Kemerton and earlier this month flagged building a plant in Europe to process spodumene mined in WA.  MinRes is also considering building a hydroxide plant at Kalgoorlie in WA's Goldfields in its own right.

An increase in take-up of household batteries would help Australia's energy transition, amid growing concern about the pace of development of new renewable energy generation to compensate for the retirement of fossil fuel power stations.   Solar battery installation will enable free energy generated by the sun to be stored for later use. Homes and businesses set up with solar and storage are guaranteed lower power bills, which will be a relief to many as we go into winter,  Mr Johnston said.  Haves and have-nots  Solar and batteries offer households some respite. Households can power their homes from rooftop solar and, if the sun is not shining, electricity from the battery is used instead.  But the benefits are likely to be disproportionately enjoyed by wealthier households. Solar and battery package costs typically exceed $15,000 even for the smallest systems, well beyond the reach of many struggling with inflation and soaring interest rates.

Some retailers have begun offering cheap finance for households interested in solar and battery packages, but the increased cost of capital has hindered efforts.  The federal government has prioritised increasing the take-up of batteries in Australia, but concedes these storage options remain out of reach for many.

He says a primary driver of investment flows is the quest for investments that store carbon.  Brand was in on the ground floor when the carbon market was first being explored in the northern hemisphere.   When I was getting my PhD in the mid-1980s, I worked on the acid rain problems in North America, including some of the early kind of carbon cycle studies in the Canadian boreal forest.   And then when they had the Earth Summit in '92, I was a technical supporter for the federal government of Canada, and that was what led me down here on an inter-governmental exchange. I never left.   Then I became a businessman in the middle of my career. So, going from science and public policy and inter-governmental negotiation to really thinking about how capital markets could support some of these kind of international aspirations.

I often say to people, 'if you look to the point where there's 10 billion people on Earth, earning $30,000 per capita, that's a $300 trillion gross world product, which is like putting three economies on the planet'.  Long-term thematic   So, things like a bioeconomy - where you've got sustainable, renewable materials increasingly supporting that economy - are going to be important. That's the long-term thematic of our business.   Brand's genius as an entrepreneur shone through when New Forests stepped in and bought the MIS timber scheme called Great Southern, which collapsed in 2009.  The MIS schemes, which included Timbercorp, were encouraged by generous federal government tax breaks designed to build a sustainable timber industry.  Advertisement  But the strategy failed because the cash flows could not support the debt. Investors jumped in on the recommendation of financial advisers paid overly generous up-front commissions.  The abject failure of the government strategy is evident from the fact we are still a net importer of timber.  But the Great Southern insolvency was a once-in-a-generation opportunity for New Forests.  Brand says it was an ugly, difficult process negotiating to buy the timber assets.  Great Southern was built through 20 years of people buying coastal farm properties and planting trees on them,  he says.   You'd never see an asset like that assembled again. It comprised 660 properties with 276,000 hectares. I think they had to bring the transaction documents in with a forklift, and it took the whole day to close the deal. I think there were 700 lawyers on the final email trail.   New Forests bought the Great Southern land bank, which was still encumbered with all the retail investor trees.  Advertisement  The financial metrics were staggeringly good for New Forests when you consider there were two tranches of trees, managed by Tasmanian company Gunns, which had absorbed $ 1.6 billion in capital. New Forests bought these for $68 million.  The second leg of the deal was the land itself, which was bought by New Forests for $415 million. About half of the Great Southern assets have been sold, and New Forests is left with land worth $1.7 billion and trees worth $ 800 million.  'Unbelievable transformation'   It's just been an unbelievable transformation of that asset into what's probably one of the greatest forestry estates in the world,  Brand says.  The second big expansion opportunity came in 2013 when the Gunns forestry company in Tasmania went bankrupt. New Forests bought the pine sawmills in South Australia and Tasmania for $50 million.  Later, when the Gunns forestry assets in Tasmania went bankrupt, New Forests bought those for about $320 million. Brand says they are worth about $1.2 billion today.  Advertisement  He says one critical piece in the expansion process was the involvement of a Canadian company called Alberta Investment Management Corporation, which provided the seed capital to get the Gunns deal done.  The CEO of AIMC at the time was Leo de Bever, who provided Brand with a letter saying his firm was good for $350 million in investment capital. This got Brand exclusivity on the deal and was key to the successful transaction.   The whole forestry sector of Australia has been recapitalised, and probably in 2010 you could have bought it for $5 billion - today it would cost you $25 billion,  he says.  When New Forests began, about 90 per cent of its investments were in the United States. Now, about a quarter are in Australia and New Zealand.  Brand's decision to step back as CEO of New Forests to become chairman, comes as Japanese investors have bought control of the company.  Mitsui & Co and Nomura Holdings agreed last year to take control, with Mitsui lifting its holding from 23 per cent to 49 per cent, and Nomura buying 41 per cent. Staff will own 10 per cent.  The Japanese will provide capital to support the company's strategic growth, including the global expansion of its investment platform. New Forests will leverage Nomura's global distribution network, particularly across Japan and more broadly in Asia.

Rogers, who spent 10 years at Colonial First State Global Asset Management for a decade before joining New Forests in 2016, says New Forests is ready to ride the ESG investment phenomenon, which is driven by the demand for carbon credits.   We've been the first people to trade forestry carbon credits in the Emission Reduction Fund here in Australia,  he says.

Chesnut said Hispanic evangelicals tend to be more conservative than Latino Catholics around LGBTQ+ issues but more progressive than white evangelicals on immigration.

Photo: Ron Flores for Axios  Axios gathered hundreds of business leaders and policymakers at the second annual What's Next Summit on Wednesday with the goal of cracking the code on the future of business, entertainment and travel.  Why it matters: There was a lot of chatter around artificial intelligence, the evolution of corporate culture and the return of events -- all issues that are spearheaded by or directly impact the work of communicators.  Catch up quick: Axios editor-in-chief Sara Goo and I moderated a discussion on the future of work.  Key take-aways: Folks are concerned about AI, the return-to-office debate is still brewing and there remains a lack of representation in the workplace.  Zoom in: Most of those in the room were already using AI for image generation, creation of marketing materials, drafting internal messaging and conducting research or summarization.  This isn't unique to the business leaders in attendance. A recent report found that roughly half of companies are already using AI tools like ChatGPT and 85% plan to within the next 6 months.  Everyone -- from GenZ employees to working parents -- believe that flexibility should be emphasized within a company's culture.  According to a recent Gallagher survey, much of this responsibility falls on internal comms, with 74% saying that the purpose of internal communication is to support culture and create alignment around an organization's purpose and strategy.  Plus, a more flexible work culture will lead to more inclusion and representation across all levels.  Events are also back, and in-person attendees are more engaged than ever.  They expect a personalized experience, which starts with smart outreach, said Joe Berchtold, president and chief financial officer of Live Nation Entertainment.   We want to make sure we are communicating with audiences in a meaningful way -- not clogging their inboxes and destroying our reputation,  said Berchtold.  Now we're able to tailor specific messages to specific groups and specific markets.   Some audiences are still opting to attend events virtually. For that reason, event producers are continuing to offer hybrid, livestreamed options too.  The bottom line: The post-pandemic impacts on work, and now the hype and interest around AI, are still roiling workplaces -- putting a greater onus on communicators to explain new policies and tech.

The big picture: Movies that featured diverse casts outperformed those that didn't regardless of how they're released, according to the the UCLA's Hollywood Diversity Report, which was published today.  Latinos remain underrepresented in most Hollywood jobs despite being avid moviegoers who helped keep cinema alive during the first year of the pandemic.  By the numbers: 83% of movie directors for the top theatrical releases last year were white, an increase from 2019, while just 1.1% were Latino, according to the report.  Latinos fared better in streaming films, where they made up 5% of directors and 4% of writers in 2022.  In theatrical releases, Latinos accounted for just 2.3% of lead roles in 2022, while in streaming their proportion was 6.1%.  The researchers analyzed the top 200 English-language theatrical releases and the top 100 English-language original streaming movies.  Between the lines: The study found that movies with diverse casts outperformed others.  The most streamed movies of 2022 --  Turning Red  and  Encanto  -- star Asian and Latina characters, respectively.  Films that featured 31% to 40% of people of color also performed well, including  Top Gun: Maverick ,  Avatar: The Way of Water  and  Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,  according to the report.  The report also examined the representation of actors with disabilities for the first time, finding they are severely underrepresented.  It found just two lead actors (2.3%) in theatrical releases had physical or hearing disabilities.  Overall, about 26% of the population has a disability.  What they're saying: Ana-Christina Ramon, director of the entertainment and media research initiative at UCLA, tells Axios Latino that it's clear viewers are gravitating toward diverse content no matter the platform.   So if you think that for the theatrical side there's no need to really increase diversity with the leads or with the directors and writers, I think that's misguided and that's not gonna give (studios) the profits that they want,  Ramon adds.

Australia will always remain a reliable supplier of energy to Japan and a safe destination for foreign investment,  she said.  Speaking a day after Greens leader Adam Bandt described gas giants as  greedy bastards , Mr Ueda said the Australian energy policy environment  today appears to be driven almost by ideology and domestic concerns .   This gives us great cause for concern. The likely consequences of the new policies being rushed into legislation are considerable,  he said.  'Very sinister consequences'   On the geopolitical front, Australia's 'quiet quitting' of the LNG business has potentially very sinister consequences,  he said.  Advertisement   The question of who will replace Australian supply into the market is front and centre.   Alarmingly, the inconvenient truth is most likely that Russia, China and Iran fill the void.   I hope this point is obvious to all of you and that you appreciate that this outcome would represent a direct threat to the rules-based international order essential to the peace, stability and prosperity of the region, if not the world.   Mr Ueda's audience included the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Jan Adams, Trade Minister Don Farrell and the heads of the Australian Industry Group, the Minerals Council of Australia and gas lobby APPEA.  His remarks carry particular weight as the Ichthys project is one of the largest in terms of capital and revenue for both Australia and Japan, where it accounts for 10 per cent of LNG imports.  Don't let Tokyo's neon lights go out  Advertisement  Mr Ueda's speech came as the company celebrated its 500th LNG cargo from the firm's Darwin port, which was the scene of a sod-turning ceremony led by former prime minister Julia Gillard in 2012.  Japanese ambassador Shingo Yamagami warned Tokyo's  neon lights  would go out. Bloomberg  It follows a growing chorus of criticism in recent months led by Japanese ambassador Shingo Yamagami, who told the gathering that Tokyo's  neon lights  would go out if Australia ever stopped producing resources exports, which account for 70 per cent of coal, 60 per cent of iron ore and 40 per cent of Japan's gas imports.  Said one Coalition figure who attended the event:  It'd be handy if Australian business leaders could speak that plainly.   Opposition resources spokeswoman Susan McDonald described the event as an  extraordinary indictment of this government  and accused Mr Farrell for giving a flippant response to Mr Ueda's comments.  Mr Farrell told the Senate that the Inpex chief's words would have  zero  impact on Australia's  international reputation or our stability as a supplier, among other things, of gas .  Advertisement  'Perverse' policy will make emissions worse  Noting Labor's shock gas market intervention late last year, as well as this week's safeguard mechanism reforms, which have raised the bar for future gas exporters, Mr Ueda said  rushed  new policies were set to make climate change worse.   In a perverse way, the new policies intended to reduce the impact of climate change will most likely have the opposite outcome,  he said.  He said global demand for LNG was growing fast, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.   Australia is competing for global investment and the changes we are seeing to Australian policy settings will choke investment and strangle the expansion of LNG projects in this country,  he said.  The consequence is that the region's increasing energy demand will be  met by coal and not by natural gas .  Advertisement   The result will be much higher global greenhouse gas emissions and will make net zero by 2050 an impossible task.   Mr Ueda said Inpex was determined to invest in both  green  and  blue  hydrogen, which Victorian Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio has refused to endorse in Victoria, where a $2.25 billion Japanese investment in the Latrobe Valley is threatened.  Mr Ueda said:  Some ideologues insist that only 'green hydrogen' is acceptable - that is, hydrogen produced from water using renewable energy - we take a more pragmatic view.   Blue hydrogen is likely to be more economic to develop and thus more competitive in the marketplace.   This is another example where we must not let perfect stand in the way of the good.   The Japanese CEO chided federal Labor for its failure to embrace carbon capture and storage, without which, he said Australia would fall short of its net zero by 2050 ambition.  Advertisement  This week's safeguard mechanism deal with the Greens included a pledge to almost double industry assistance to affected heavy emitters but none of the increase would be spent on CCS development.   For whatever reason, the Australian government seems hesitant to 'lean in' on CCS projects,  Mr Ueda said.  This stands in stark contrast with most other nations.   A failure to facilitate CCS also threatens this country's aspiration to become a clean energy superpower and sacrifices the associated jobs, investment and revenue.   CCS effectively becomes mandatory  Mr Ueda said the safeguard mechanism, which passed parliament on Thursday, would require all new gas fields tied to existing LNG facilities to be net zero on day one.   CCS effectively becomes mandatory for all new oil and gas projects in Australia,  he said.  Advertisement   This outcome clearly underlies the critical importance of carbon capture and storage.   Although Mr Ueda welcomed Mr Albanese's support for the gas export industry, he urged him to find the political courage to convert his rhetorical support for gas  into deeds .  Mr Albanese was invited last week by Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to attend this year's Group of Seven summit in Tokyo in May, following a meeting between the pair last year in Perth at which the Australian leader told his counterpart that exports were assured.  In her statement, Ms King said she had been a long-time supporter of Inpex and the jobs it creates in WA and the NT.   This government has extensively consulted the gas sector on its energy policies,  she said.

Why it matters: Extra cash sloshing around the economy -- a legacy of pandemic-era stimulus and high savings rates -- may have helped blunt spillover from tighter lending standards.  The huge risk is that may not be repeated as the stockpile built up over the pandemic runs down. That sets up the possibility of a dwindling cushion, as banks pull back on lending in the wake of the SVB collapse.  What they're saying:  [E]xcess cash has allowed economic activity to be funded from alternative sources of liquidity over the last couple of years, keeping financial conditions easy for areas which would typically have been constrained by tighter bank lending,  TD Securities' Rich Kelly, Priya Misra and James Rossiter wrote in a note.   As the lagged impact of this savings stockpile wears out, it presents the risk that economic activity may have to adjust more suddenly when the recession hits,  they write.  Where it stands: Before the string of bank failures earlier this month, one had to squint to see the impact of a rapid tightening of interest rates, intended to chill the economy. Businesses were still hiring swiftly, consumer demand was still strong and prices continued to rise quickly.  The intrigue: The fallout of the Silicon Valley Bank crisis has tightened financial conditions, though Fed chair Jerome Powell noted earlier this month that traditional indices gauging financial conditions don't take bank lending into account.  That means that overall tightening may be more severe than indices suggest, with possibly a bigger blow to economic activity to follow.

Photo: Photo: Nicholas Kamm/AFP via Getty Images  A federal judge in Texas ruled Thursday that employers can't be required to cover specified preventive health care services under the Affordable Care Act.  Why it matters: The ruling has major implications for the more than 150 million Americans on employer-sponsored health plans and could put millions on the hook financially for certain skin and lung cancer screenings, statins for heart disease, medications that prevent HIV and other services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  The Biden administration is expected to appeal the decision and ask for a stay.  Context: The ruling stemmed from a case brought by six individuals and two Christian-owned businesses who argued that they should not be mandated to offer coverage of HIV PrEP because they did not want to encourage  homosexual behavior.   Under the ACA, most health insurance plans must cover certain recommended preventive services, including HIV testing for people aged 15-65 and HIV PrEP for adults who are at high risk of getting HIV. There's no cost-sharing, a stipulation intended to get more enrollees to use them.  Last September, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor ruled that ACA's PrEP mandate violated the defendants' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a law that  ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected.   The ruling today covers services the Preventive Services Task Force most highly recommends for preventive care. About 6 in 10 people with private health insurance, or roughly 100 million, use ACA-covered preventive health services, per the Kaiser Family Foundation.  O'Connor is the same Texas judge who sided with the plaintiffs in an earlier major ACA court case, ruling that the law is unconstitutional and should be struck down.  The ruling has possible implications for the ACA's contraception mandate, which was challenged in the case. O'Connor rejected that challenge in a prior decision, but the plaintiffs are expected to appeal that as this case continues to wind through the courts, University of Michigan law professor Nicholas Bagley wrote on Twitter.   All preventive services are kind of up for grabs as we go through the appeals process,  said Laurie Sobel, associate director for women's health policy at KFF.  What we're watching: With the ACA's preventive services requirement being voluntary, insurers can either drop coverage of these services or start charging enrollees for them.  While some religiously motivated employers might attempt to move quickly,  for most people with insurance contracts being in place for a calendar year, I would think there would not be an immediate impact,  said Zachary Baron, associate director at Georgetown's O'Neill Institute for National & Global Health Law.  States regulate private insurance and may be able to preserve access to some preventive services, but are blocked by the federal ERISA law from regulating self-insured employer plans.  The case could ultimately wind up at the Supreme Court, following the same trajectory as the last ACA lawsuit that O'Connor ruled on.  Tina Reed contributed to this story.

Driving the news: Evan Gershkovich is the first U.S. journalist to be detained in an espionage case since the Cold War, the Committee to Protect Journalists told Axios.  The big picture: The move ratchets up Russia's longstanding crackdown on freedom of the press, which escalated with the onset of the Ukraine invasion.  In March 2022, Russia enacted a punitive  fake news  law that threatened to imprison journalists and individuals who spread information about the war in Ukraine that Russia deemed to be false.  Many news organizations temporarily suspended their operations in Russia as a result.   We consider this an unjust detention and call on the State Department to designate his detention in that manner at once,  National Press Club President Eileen O'Reilly said in a statement Thursday, calling for Gershkovich's immediate release. (O'Reilly is Axios' managing editor of standards and training).  What we know about the arrest  Gershkovich was detained in the city of Yekaterinburg, in the Ural Mountains, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) -- the successor organization to the Soviet Union's KGB -- said in a statement Thursday, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.  The FSB did not specify when exactly the arrest took place, but the Wall Street Journal reported that he dropped out of contact with his editors Wednesday afternoon.  Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted for espionage, per AP.  State of play: Gershkovich pleaded not guilty in a Moscow court on Thursday, Russian state news agency TASS reported.  The court has ordered that he held in custody until May 29, according to TASS.  Trials for espionage in Russia can take months and are often held in secret, according to the WSJ. Acquittals are extremely rare.  What Russia said about the arrest  The FSB accused Gershkovich of trying to obtain classified information  on the instructions of the United States,  according to RIA Novosti.  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that Gershkovich had been  caught red-handed,  TASS reported. They accused him of trying to gather information  on the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.   How the WSJ has responded  The Wall Street Journal said in a statement that it  vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich.    We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family,  the statement added.  Wall Street Journal Editor-in-Chief Emma Tucker told staff in a memo Thursday that the paper was  very concerned  for Gershkovich's safety after he was detained the previous day, CNN reported.  The U.S. Embassy in Moscow and State Department did not immediately respond to Axios' requests for comment.  The U.S. response  The Biden administration is  deeply concerned  by Gershkovich's detainment, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.   The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest terms,  Jean-Pierre added.  The administration has been in contact with the WSJ and Gershkovich's family, and the State Department has been in touch with the Russian government in an effort to get consular access to Gershkovich, she added.   In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.  What to know about Gershkovich  Gershkovich has worked at the WSJ since January 2022 as part of the paper's Moscow bureau, where he had helped cover the war in Ukraine, domestic developments in Russia, and other former Soviet states.  The FSB acknowledged in their statement that Gershkovich was accredited as a journalist by Russia's foreign ministry, per RIA Novosti.

Why it matters: Susman is one of the few communicators to successfully position her team as trusted partners and key strategic assets.  How she got here: Susman got her start in politics before jumping into corporate communication roles at American Express, Estee Lauder and now, Pfizer.   How it's structured: She manages a team of roughly 500 who oversee communications, corporate responsibility, government relations, public affairs and policy, patient advocacy and investor relations.   Work travel tip: As opposed to bouncing from conference room to conference room, Susman always makes an effort to  see something real.   Most recently, during a stop in Austin, Texas, for SXSW, Susman  explored the University of Texas campus and pursued barbecue with a vengeance. You know, and I think those kind of things are just really important.   Trend watch: The rise of CEO influence.   What companies say and do is under enormous scrutiny, but great leaders are gaining some headway in terms of being educators, connectors, and sharing insights that are really important. Throughout COVID, our CEO became the educator in chief and I think that could be a trend.    Communication shifts: Stakeholder activism and digital media have changed everything, says Susman.   The digital explosion has given stakeholders global access to information, their own microphones and amplification opportunities. Every day has a different set of challenges and opportunities based on what's happening in the world.   Most important comms skills: Intentionality and candor.   It's something that is so hard to do given the fast-paced nature of our lives, but I was really lucky that I had a watershed moment early in my life when coming out in the early '80s. It confirmed for me that the short-term pain that can sometimes come from having a really candid conversation will reward you with peace and with pride.   Most overlooked skill: Humor.   I can't tell a joke to save my life, but it is so effective in lightening the mood in building a feeling of friendship or camaraderie.   Zoom in:  I've struggled to be joyful in the workplace, but I listened to feedback and made it a priority,  Susman told Axios.  My team wasn't looking for a stand-up comedian, but someone who can celebrate a great achievement, who sees them and honors their successes, and who laughs at my own mistakes.   Media diet: She recently read  Ride of a Lifetime  by Bob Iger and is currently re-watching HBO's  The Sopranos.   Influenced by: LinkedIn is Susman's social media platform of choice.

Yellen served as a Federal Reserve chair and other top posts at the nation's central bank.  Yellen will use her remarks to implement more banking regulations that began in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.   These events remind us of the urgent need to complete unfinished business: to finalize post-crisis reforms, consider whether deregulation may have gone too far, and repair the cracks in the regulatory perimeter that the recent shocks have revealed,  Yellen will say.  The Journal noted some former regulators have said that D.C. regulators have been too focused on America's largest banks after the 2008 financial crisis, potentially ignoring possible issues with small and medium-sized banks. In 2018, under then-President Donald Trump, Congress passed a bill to roll back regulations that were viewed as too onerous for community banks.  The Fed is now reconsidering rules for medium-sized banks, or those with assets between $100 and $250 billion. The Biden White House will likely issue recommendations for rules to increase scrutiny over medium-sized banks.   Regulatory requirements have been loosened in recent years. I believe it is appropriate to assess the impact of these deregulatory decisions and take any necessary actions in response,  Yellen will say.   In large part, this was due to the post-crisis reforms we put in place. But in both cases, the government had to deliver substantial interventions to ease the pressure on certain parts of the financial system. This means that more work must be done,  she will say.  Yellen said the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), an interagency group created under Dodd-Frank reforms, will change its rules to subject institutions such as money-market funds to more supervision.

The financial stability risks posed by money market and open-end funds have not been sufficiently addressed,  she will remark.

The WSJ  vehemently  denied the allegations and demanded the  immediate release  of Gershkovich.  Russia's FSB security service, successor to the notorious KGB, said it obtained authorization to arrest Gershkovich after a closed-door meeting of the Lefortovo district court in Moscow. Gershkovich's lawyer was not allowed to attend this meeting, and journalists were barred from the entire floor of the courthouse where it took place. Russian state media claimed these precautions were necessary because a bomb threat was called into the building.  The FSB charged Gershkovich with  collecting information about one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex, which constitutes a state secret.  He allegedly conducted this vaguely described espionage at the behest of the U.S. government.   It is not about a suspicion, it is about the fact that he was caught red-handed,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov insisted on Wednesday.  Gershkovich has been reporting on the attitude of the Russian public toward the invasion of Ukraine from the Ural Mountains city of Ekaterinburg for several weeks. He was said to be working on a story about the infamous Wagner Group mercenary organization at the time of his arrest.  Before his assignment in Ekaterinburg, Gershkovich lived in Moscow for six years. He worked for the Moscow Times and Agence France-Presse (AFP) before joining the WSJ in 2022. Prior to moving to Moscow, he worked as a news assistant for the New York Times.  Gershkovich was duly accredited as a journalist by the Russian Foreign Ministry, but Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova claimed on Wednesday he abused his credentials for  activities that have nothing to do with journalism.   According to Russian media, the reporter was taken into custody by FSB agents in Ekaterinburg and transported to Moscow, where he pleaded not guilty to the charges. He could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Experts on the Russian  legal system  said he could spend a year or more in prison, largely incommunicado, before the investigation is completed. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov ruled out any possibility of freeing Gershkovich with a quick prisoner swap.  Gershkovich is the first American journalist to be detained in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, but far from the first high-profile foreigner to be taken hostage by the regime of leader Vladimir Putin since he invaded Ukraine.  Some observers believe Gershkovich was kidnapped to give Russia more leverage in negotiations for the release of two alleged Russian spies arrested in Slovenia in December. Others viewed his arrest as part of Putin's escalating crackdown on journalism and political dissent as the war in Ukraine grinds on or as an act of revenge against the U.S. for sanctions. Many wondered if Putin sensed weakness he could exploit after securing the release of legendary arms kingpin Viktor Bout for U.S. women's basketball player Brittney Griner in an absurdly lopsided December prisoner swap.  RELATED: Joe Biden Calls Brittney Griner  Best About America  While Leaving Behind Marine Veteran  The White House  Jeanne Cavelier of Reporters Without Borders said on Thursday:  We are very alarmed because it is probably a way to intimidate all Western journalists that are trying to investigate aspects of the war on the ground in Russia. The Western powers should immediately ask for clarifications on the charges, because as far as we know he was just doing his job as a journalist.   That unwritten rule not to touch accredited foreign journalists has stopped working,  Russian defense attorney Ivan Pavlov warned.  The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was  deeply concerned  by the arrest of Gershkovich, which was  the latest in a long line of attempts by Russia to use national security laws to silence reporting.   The National Press Club said in a statement on the case:  Evan Gershkovich is a journalist. He should be released immediately and unharmed and allowed to return to his important work. Evan has a significant and distinguished career working for the New York Times and AFP prior to the Wall Street Journal. We consider this an unjust detention and call on the State Department to designate his detention in that manner at once.  Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center senior fellow Tatiana Stanovaya told the New York Times (NYT) on Thursday that Moscow probably took Gershkovich as a  negotiating chip  and a provocation, hoping to  attract a lot of attention politically in the United States so that the authorities will have to react.   The Biden administration had not responded to the arrest of Gerhskovich as of Thursday morning.   The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich. We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family,  the WSJ said on Thursday.  Gershkovich's editors said they lost contact with him on Wednesday afternoon while he was working in Ekaterinburg. The first solid clue to his situation was a photo posted to the messaging site Telegram that showed an unidentified man being dragged out of a restaurant in the city and loaded into a van. FSB officials in Ekaterinburg initially denied any knowledge of Gershkovich's arrest."}, {"source": "breitbart-news", "title": "Health Concerns Spread as Pope Francis Spends Night in Hospital", "text": "ROME -- Pope Francis spent the night in Rome's Gemelli Hospital where he was rushed in an ambulance Wednesday afternoon after complaining of  breathing difficulties.   According to reports from the Vatican Press Office, he is currently being treated for a  respiratory infection,  which will require several days in hospital.  The Vatican said the pontiff had spent a quiet night in the hospital's 10th-floor suite reserved for him, after a chest CT scan and blood oxygen saturation tests reportedly ruled out serious problems.  According to the attending doctors, Francis' health  does not give cause for concern.   Local media said the news of the 86-year-old pope's hospitalization caused a  shock  among cardinals and bishops, as the prelates scrambled to obtain reliable news from inside channels rather than trust the proverbially sunny official reports coming from the Vatican Press Office.

The reason for the consternation, the article insists, is that nobody knows exactly what is wrong with the pope, of which  the official bulletin is the proof.   The Vatican press office's  brief, laconic, and almost mysterious text  sought to reassure readers that everything had been pre-planned, which was evidently untrue from the start, since he immediately had to revise his busy schedule to cancel a number of important meetings.  Vatican News asserted that Francis is undergoing  medical check-ups in Rome's Gemelli Hospital,  which were  previously scheduled.   Francis'  breathing difficulties  reportedly extend to  chest pain,  leading some to suspect possible cardiac complications.

The increase comes after the House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer (R-KY) revealed in March the Biden family received a collective $1.3 million cut in 2017 from a Biden family business associate, who was sent a $3 million wire transfer from a Chinese energy company linked to the CCP.  The committee has also discovered unreported funds the Biden family businesses received while Joe Biden was vice president. Overall, the Biden family business has received more than 31 million during his reign as vice president.  Hunter has confirmed the $1.3 million China payout, while Joe Biden falsely denied it.  According to the poll, 64 percent believe Joe Biden did something illegal or unethical, the poll found in March. That number is greater than the poll's findings in December when 62 percent said the president had done something illegal or unethical in connection with the Biden family business.  Polling data shows the increase of two percent was transferred from those who were recorded as unsure in December. Seven percent in December did not know if Joe Biden did something illegal or unethical. In March, that number shrank two percentage points to five percent.  The number of voters who believe Biden has done nothing wrong has remained constant. Only 31 percent in March said Joe Biden  hasn't done anything seriously wrong,  mirroring the same number from December's poll.  The growing belief that Joe Biden has done something wrong is tracing Hunter Biden's polling data on the same question. Seventy-six percent say Hunter did something illegal or unethical, up from 73 percent in February and 70 percent in December.  Those who did not know if Hunter did something illegal or unethical has also shrunk over four months: 11 percent in March, 9 percent in February, 6 percent in December.  By convincing the undecideds, the polling data suggests Comer is winning the public relations battle against the White House, which has often refused to engage with the media.  Speaking with Bloomberg on Wednesday, Comer vowed to keep investigating the Biden family for nine violations to determine if Joe Biden is compromised by China for legislative purposes.   We believe the reason the family was receiving this money is because of favors that Joe Biden did as vice president and or as president,  Comer said.  He added the trove of bank documents that revealed the $1.3 million China payout to the Biden family is one set of many more to be disclosed to the public in the coming months:  My Biden family investigation has a legislative purpose.

While several media outlets strategically omitted details of the shooter being transgender on social media initially, a new narrative has appeared to emerge. A report from the Daily Mail now asserts that the 28-year-old suspect, Audrey Hale, was  rejected  by her Christian parents as they reportedly refused to allow Hale to use he/him pronouns or dress as a man under their roof.  From the Daily Mail's report, Hale would leave the home to change outfits. The outlet cited a  well-placed  source who said the parents  did know about it  but  they just didn't accept it.   The Daily Mail framed it this way on March 28:  Twenty years later, after being rejected by her Christian family when she came out to them as gay, Hale had turned into a killer.  The tone appears to place at least partial blame on the shooter's Christian family. Ironically, based on reports, Hale still lived with her parents, so it remains unclear how much they could have  rejected  her as they continued to put a roof over her head:  EXCLUSIVE: Nashville mass school shooter was rejected by her Christian parents https://t.co/hQMxipernF pic.twitter.com/xzmpcvo3r9 -- Daily Mail US (@DailyMail) March 28, 2023  The establishment media has gone out of its way to kneel to the demands of the radical left, going as far as essentially apologizing for accurately describing the shooter as a woman.

The report squares with other information that has been released.  For example, on March 28, 2023, Breitbart News noted that parents of the transgender shooter were unaware that she still had guns.

China is Brazil's largest trade partner, meaning the deal will significant decrease Brazil's use of the dollar generally. The deal is one of several between the two countries planned to be announced this week, when Lula was expected to travel to Beijing for meetings with dictator Xi Jinping. Lula, 77, was forced to cancel his travels after being diagnosed with influenza-induced pneumonia this week.  The move follows aggressive efforts in the past five years by China to limit the influence of the U.S. dollar and slowly convince the world to use commerce using the yuan. Beijing has long counted on Brazil as an ally and friend - and fellow member of the BRICS economic and political coalition, whose members have pushed for the eradication of the dollar in global trade - even through the tepid relations with conservative former President Jair Bolsonaro. Towards the end of his term last year, Bolsonaro administration officials stated they had a  great interest  joining China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global debt trap plan to erode poorer nations' sovereignties through predatory loans meant for infrastructure development.  According to the Brazilian news outlet G1, China and Brazil will create a  clearing house  mechanism with the power of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) to rapidly exchange reals into yuan and vice versa, eliminating the need for the dollar. Currently, any trade between Chinese and Brazilian businesses, including loans and purchases, requires each side to convert their national currency into dollars to send to the other side. G1 noted, citing Lula administration officials, that China has already established similar  clearing houses  in Chile and Argentina, countries that have officially joined the Belt and Road Initiative.   The expectation is that this will reduce costs ... promote even greater bilateral trade and facilitate investment,  the Brazilian Trade and Investment Promotion Agency (Apex Brasil) said in a statement announcing the agreement on Wednesday. Apex Brasil is part of the nation's Foreign Ministry.  The deal will likely impact billions of dollars in trade. Brazil and China documented upwards of $150 billion in trade volume throughout 2022, most of it Chinese exports to Brazil. Brazil is a major source of key agricultural products, notably soy beans, to China; Brazil's exports made up nearly $90 billion worth of trade with China last year. China has been Brazil's largest trade partner for 13 years, since Lula's last stint in office, which ended in 2011.  RELATED: Trump's Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke EXPOSES Successor Deb Haaland's Ignorance on China Threat  House Appropriations Committee  The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed the agreement on Thursday, refraining from fully celebrating it but expressing hope that it would facilitate increased trade with Brazil.   Earlier this year, China and Brazil signed a memorandum of cooperation to establish renminbi (RMB) [yuan] clearing arrangements in Brazil,  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said.  These arrangements will help enterprises and financial institutions in both countries conduct cross-border transactions using the RMB. They will also further facilitate bilateral trade and investment.   Lula has been one of Latin America's most vocal proponents of moving away from using the dollar as a common trade currency. Throughout his candidacy for president last year, the former president and inmate promoted the idea of creating a Euro-style common currency for South America, titled the sur, alongside socialist Argentina.   We are going to restore our relationship with Latin America. God willing, we will create a Latin American currency,  Lula said in an interview in May.  We don't have to depend on the dollar.   In January, following Lula's inauguration, the specter of the sur arose in local media again, as Argentine President Alberto Fernandez sought the support of the largest economy on the continent to keep the woefully performing Argentine peso afloat.   There will be a decision to start studying the parameters needed for a common currency, which includes everything from fiscal issues to the size of the economy and the role of central banks,  Argentine Economy Minister Sergio Massa said to the Financial Times in January.  It would be a study of mechanisms for trade integration. ... I don't want to create any false expectations, it's the first step on a long road which Latin America must travel.   The BRICS coalition - Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa - has also openly sought ways to distance the world economy from the American dollar. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, Russian leader Vladimir Putin increased the pressure of BRICS to seek ways to conduct trade outside of the dollar, allowing Russia to stay afloat amid Western sanctions on its economy.   The Russian president stated earlier that together with other BRICS nations, Moscow was working on alternative mechanisms of payment. Putin emphasized that Russia's financial messaging system was open for banks from other BRICS countries to join,  the Russian news agency Tass reported in June.  According to Putin, efforts are underway to create an international reserve currency based on the basket of BRICS currencies and Russia's Mir payment system is expanding its global presence.   Chinese officials noted that month that the Russian government, which has greatly increased its oil exports to China in the past year, was increasingly urging Beijing to find a way out of using the dollar to enact trade, offering to use the yuan instead.  BRICS will likely require more and stronger member nations to solidify its stance as an alternative economic mechanism to the current dollar-led financial order. To that end, BRICS nation leaders have spent much of the past year discussing expansion. Argentina, Iran, and Saudi Arabia are among the top country names repeatedly surfacing as having an interest in joining BRICS and the economic potential to bring enough to the table to clear the bar for entry.  Disgraced former Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, Lula's protege, was chosen to lead BRICS' New Development Bank (NDB), its alternative institution to global finance agencies like the International Monetary Fund (IMF), last week.   Mrs. Dilma Vana Rousseff, a renowned stateswoman and economist devoted to global development over the years, enjoys high prestige and significant influence in the world,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Thursday.  China, as the host country, welcomes the assumption of office by Mrs. Rousseff. We will continue to deepen all-round cooperation with the NDB and fully support her work.

The agency has said it plans to propose a special assessment on the industry in May to make its $128 billion deposit insurance fund whole after it was hit by the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the report published Wednesday said.  Officials are looking to limit the burden on community lenders by putting a greater share of the expense on larger institutions, according to Bloomberg. Discussions over the size and timing of the assessment are in early stages.  The FDIC is under political pressure to spare small banks from filling the hole in the agency's coffers. The report said the regulator has noted it has latitude in how it sets those fees. A special assessment may be applicable to bank behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  The cost of the bank failures has piled up because the FDIC, the US Treasury, and the Federal Reserve said all depositors at SVB and Signature Bank would fully protected. The FDIC usually guarantees coverage for up to $250,000 per account.  A spokesperson for the FDIC on Thursday declined to comment on the Bloomberg report and instead pointed Insider to remarks made Wednesday by FDIC Acting Chair Martin Gruenberg to the House Committee on Financial Services.

In an interview with the news outlet Factor.am, Gagik Melkonyan, the deputy of the Armenian National Assembly -- the country's ruling party -- said this week that if Putin were to travel there,  he should be arrested,  according to a translation by The Daily Beast.   It is better for Putin to stay in his country,  Melkonyan said, according to the translation.  If we enter into these agreements, then we must fulfill our obligations. Let Russia solve its problems with Ukraine.   A spokesperson for the Kremlin did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  Armenia is among a growing group of countries that have said they would enforce an international warrant issued by the International Criminal Court earlier this month. The ICC accused Putin of ordering the abduction of children in occupied parts of Ukraine -- which would be considered a war crime.  Germany, Ireland, Austria, and Croatia have already said they would enforce the warrant, while the UK and France welcomed ICC's decision, but did not comment on whether they would commit to arresting the Russian leader.  Despite being a signatory to the Rome Statute -- the treaty that established the ICC -- Russian ally Hungary said last week that they would not arrest Putin, Reuters reported.  Melkonyan's comments are yet another sign of tensions growing between Armenia and Russia.  Earlier this year, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said that he had canceled joint military drills, calling them  inappropriate in the current situation,  the Associated Press reported.  In a Collective Security Treaty Organization summit last year, Putin was repeatedly snubbed by Pashinyan, including when the Armenian prime minister refused to be photographed in close proximity to him.  The CSTO is a Russian-dominated alliance of post-Soviet nations, which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan  The fall-out is largely also the result of a domestic dispute. Pashinyan has previously accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to take a more active role around the disputed separatist region of Nagorno-Karabak.  Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces since a separatist war there ended in 1994.

Thinking I had some time to spare before the party, I decided to drop by.  Upon arrival, I found two unfamiliar guys. One of them had driven from Philadelphia for the weekend. He had rented a car for a month and wanted to travel around. I didn't have a driver's license and was melting from the heat. We hit it off, and within 10 minutes, decided to take a trip outside the city together.  We set off for Montauk, on Long Island, two weeks later and spent the day together before heading to separate sleeping spots. He drove me back, and I showed him my favorite neighborhood, Brooklyn's Williamsburg, before he took off for Philly at 2 a.m.  Another two weeks passed, and he expressed an interest in moving to New York to learn more about the city. The best places seemed to be in Williamsburg, he said, and so he rented an apartment in my neighborhood.  He told me he wasn't ready for anything serious  Though we felt romantic, I sensed he was holding back on any relationship progression, often claiming he was too busy with work or tired to stay over. Two months later, he told me he wasn't ready for a relationship, which I interpreted as a cue to end. In my head, something either moves forward or backward, so I pulled out.  We didn't text each other for a week. I was coping by meeting with my girlfriends and drinking cocktails. Then one afternoon, he texted me and asked to give it another try.  He explained that he was hesitant to commit because he was recently coming out a marriage and wanted to focus on his career. I didn't mind, I said, but we would either be in a relationship, or I'd rather not spend more time on casual dating. So we started to date again.  Despite my gut feeling of him being, as my friend put it,  good marriage material,  he was often talking about something that he had missed and things he had to try before committing to something serious. A yearlong relationship was already serious, I thought. I was confused, but I loved him, so we kept going.  I wanted to know if we were headed toward having a family together  When we hit a year and a half, I wanted to know whether we were headed toward having a family or not.  I needed to set a deadline for when he would commit to marriage and having a kid together. I chose August 2022, which would mark two years of our relationship.  I was also afraid of losing my guy, so I began pushing him harder to commit to marriage. I became fixated on that idea, and every time we were watching a show where people would get married or have kids, I would burst into tears.  As my behavior became more erratic, my boyfriend started pulling away. At this point, I gave him an ultimatum: Either we get married, or we break up. Although I don't like playing ultimatum games, I didn't know what else to do.  He wasn't ready.  After a week of depression, he packed up his belongings and left for Europe. We didn't speak for two months, during which time I decided to download dating apps.  I made it a rule to go on at least one date a week to move on from my ex and find someone who shared my family plans and values. My therapist had helped me outline the qualities and values I was looking for, and I could weed out all the guys that didn't fit.  He proposed at my front door  The dates were great, but I did not feel any chemistry. So when my ex showed up out of the blue two months later, my goosebumps and warm feelings for him immediately returned. He was standing at my door -- in a gray sweater that I bought for him, with a huge bouquet of red roses, apparently confident that there was no chance I could have moved on and there was someone else in my room.  He got down on one knee and pulled out a ring. I said yes.  He told me he had to leave to figure out what he wanted, without my pressure. At first, he tried to imagine his life without me and went on a couple of dates in Europe. But he missed me and always thought about me, he said. Once he had the space to think about it, he was ready for commitment.  My now husband has never been so stable in his work and our relationship. He talks about getting a house together, kids, and building our future more than I do. Last week, he came home from a tough negotiation meeting. He said when he looked at the ring on his finger, he felt strength and support.  This marriage has been my best decision,  he said. And kissed me on the lips.

A new tax approved by Los Angeles voters in November and going into effect April 1 will tack millions in expenses onto some of LA's priciest real estate transactions. Critics have told the New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter that the new tax will only encourage developers to build new homes outside of Los Angeles to avoid the new tax.  LA voters approved Proposition ULA, commonly referred to as the  mansion tax,  by a 58% to 42% margin. The ballot measure proposed an additional tax on high-value real estate transactions; the estimated $600 million to $1.1 billion in tax revenue would go to fund affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.  The new ordinance mandates that the seller pays a 4% tax on property sales between $5 million and $10 million, and a 5.5% tax on sales over $10 million. Because it goes into effect soon -- April 1 -- some of the more expensive homes on the market are steeply discounted in an attempt to sell before then.

The tax's calculator website says it is applied on top of LA's existing property transfer tax of 0.45%. Sellers have to pay the tax regardless of whether they are making a profit or losing money on a transaction.  Dan Malka, of Ikon Advisors, told CNBC that the discounted price means his company represents a seller that is motivated to get a deal done as soon as possible, and said the price will go up to at least $41 million once the new tax is in effect, with no intention of accepting offers below that price.

A gamma-ray burst that recently hit our solar system was so bright, it temporarily blinded gamma-ray instruments in space, according to a NASA release.  Scientists say the gamma-ray burst (GRB), the most powerful type of explosion in the universe, was 70 times brighter than any previously recorded event.  They dubbed it  the BOAT,  or  brightest of all time.   What is a gamma-ray burst?  A GRB is basically a black hole's first breath into existence. And it's a spectacular one.  When a supermassive star nears the end of its life -- when it's no longer generating enough fuel in its core to support its sheer mass -- it collapses under its own weight, forming a black hole.  Two things happen during this process: First, the collapse generates an explosion called a supernova. Second, the resulting black hole is born into a massive cloud of residual gas and dust, where it proceeds to quickly gobble it all up.  Residual gas and dust surrounding a black hole leads to powerful jets, called gamma-ray bursts. NASA Goddard  What comes next has been observed many times but is still a scientific mystery as to why it happens: the black hole burps out two powerful jets of high-energy gamma radiation traveling at near the speed of light, in opposite directions.  These cosmic belches only last for a few seconds but are so bright, that astronomers have documented about 12,000 GRBs. And it's one of these jets that struck our solar system last fall.  The brightest GRB of all time  The Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 revealed the infrared afterglow (circled) of the BOAT GRB and its host galaxy, seen nearly edge-on as a sliver of light extending to the burst's upper right. NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, A. Levan (Radboud University); Image Processing: Gladys Kober  The burst, classified as GRB 221009A, was recorded on October 9, 2022. Because it blinded space instruments, they couldn't accurately record it, so scientists weren't sure how bright the burst was when it first reached our planet.  For the last several months, scientists worldwide -- including in the US, China, and Russia -- have culminated data from other instruments to measure and re-measure the GRB's brightness, determining it was 70 times brighter than any other GRB event in recorded history.  The amount of gamma radiation from GRB 221009A is significantly greater than any other GRB on record. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Adam Goldstein (USRA)  Researchers also examined the likelihood of an event like this happening again and reported that this sort of thing only occurs once every 10,000 years.   GRB 221009A was likely the brightest burst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur since human civilization began,  said Eric Burns, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, NASA reported.  Oddly enough, the jets themselves weren't the most powerful on record. What made the GRB so bright was the fact that the jets were narrow and aimed directly at Earth. So, we got a full-on view of it -- sort of like a deer in headlights.  The GRB jets were extremely narrow and aimed directly at Earth. NASA Video  Other GRBs aren't aimed directly at Earth, so we don't detect as much of their radiation and they appear dimmer.  The researchers recently announced their findings at the American Astronomical Society's High Energy Astrophysics Division and published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.  But astronomers aren't done. They're hopeful that this GRB could help solve the mystery of why black holes burp out GRBs in the first place. One theory is already in place that the jets were powered by a magnetic field that the black hole amplified as it began to spin. (Yes, black holes can spin.)  Additional observations through the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope are planned over the next few months."}, {"source": "business-insider-uk", "title": "ChatGPT investor predicts AI will 'free humanity' from work", "text": "The future of AI could  free humanity  from work, according to OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla.

But it's a future that Khosla warns won't come without major disruption or global competition.  In an interview with Semafor, the venture capitalist predicted that 80% of jobs could be completed by AI in 25 years.   This large transformation is the opportunity to free humanity from the need to work. People will work when they want to work on what they want to work on,  Khosla told Semafor.  Khosla is the founder of VC firm Khosla Ventures, which has invested in companies including DoorDash, Instacart, Impossible Foods, Wattpad, and more. Back in 2014, Khosla told Semafor, he started thinking about a future with AI, even predicting that eventually most media would be created by AI in the future and that AI will disrupt teaching.  Still, any transition to offloading most jobs to AI won't be seamless, Khosla said.   That's a utopian vision. But getting from here to that utopia is really disruptive and it is terrible to be the disrupted one,  he said.  So you have to have empathy for whoever's being disrupted. And the transition is very messy. It hurts people, hurts lives, destroys lives.   A spokesperson for Khosla did not immediately respond to Insider's request for any additional comment ahead of publication.  A study from researchers with OpenAI and the University of Pennsylvania found that AI tools, like ChatGPT, will likely impact up to 80% of the US workforce, reported Insider. AI jobs in tech, mathematics, accounting, and communication fields will be especially at risk, the researchers found.  Goldman Sachs researchers recently estimated that 300 million full-time jobs across the globe could be disrupted by AI. The report also highlighted that US workers in legal and administrative positions are especially vulnerable.  Khosla said more research is needed to aid in the advancement of the recent boom in AI -- especially as more global powers race to gain the upper hand in AI. Khosla said there are some countries, citing Rwanda and Brazil, that may not be able to fund their own AI. That stands in contrast to China, he said, which has buckled down on AI with a five-year plan to dominate in this technology."}, {"source": "business-insider-uk", "title": "FDIC may make big banks cover $23 billion in costs from bank failures", "text": "The FDIC is looking at $23 billion in costs from the SVB and Signature Bank failures.

The agency has said it plans to propose a special assessment on the industry in May to make its $128 billion deposit insurance fund whole after it was hit by the collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the report published Wednesday said.  Officials are looking to limit the burden on community lenders by putting a greater share of the expense on larger institutions, according to Bloomberg. Discussions over the size and timing of the assessment are in early stages.  The FDIC is under political pressure to spare small banks from filling the hole in the agency's coffers. The report said the regulator has noted it has latitude in how it sets those fees. A special assessment may be applicable to bank behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo.  The cost of the bank failures has piled up because the FDIC, the US Treasury, and the Federal Reserve said all depositors at SVB and Signature Bank would fully protected. The FDIC usually guarantees coverage for up to $250,000 per account.

Ron DeSantis' move to take over Walt Disney World's governing board in Florida may have backfired due to a prior obscure agreement that new governor-appointed board members say stripped them of their power.  The contentious agreement, approved without fanfare a day before DeSantis assumed more control of Disney's land, is the latest in an apparent feud between the governor and the company.  And in setting the expiration terms of the agreement, Disney invoked an obscure property law known as Rule Against Perpetuities, setting the date for  twenty one (21) years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England living as of the date of this Declaration.    This essentially makes Disney the government,  Ron Peri, a member of the board, said during a meeting on Wednesday.  This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.   For close to six decades, Disney has operated its expansive theme park and resort in Florida under a specially designated district that lies between two counties. A board, previously known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, oversaw the area and had free reign of development processes, such as zoning and infrastructure, and even control of its own fire department, essentially operating like a separate municipal government. Disney also had the authority to appoint district board members.  This special status came under threat when Disney entered the fray of DeSantis' culture war last year, after the company publicly objected to Florida's proposal to ban the discussion of sexual orientation in K-3 public classrooms.  In a show of political force, DeSantis, who is a likely contender for the 2024 Republican nomination, attempted to dissolve the Reedy Creek district. But the dissolution would have placed the burden of paying for a fire department and road maintenance, among other services, onto taxpayers in Orange and Osceola counties. Residents would also have had to pick up the district's hefty $1 billion debt.  Instead, Florida lawmakers passed a bill in February to end  Disney's self-governing status  and give the governor the authority to appoint new board members to the district. Reedy Creek was renamed to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, and DeSantis appointed five supervisors, including a parents' rights activist and three Republican donors.  But the new supervisors are now saying that previous board members entered an agreement that effectively stripped them of their powers.   We're going to have to deal with it and correct it,  Brian Aungst, a member of the board, said during a meeting on Wednesday.  It's a subversion of the will of the voters and the Legislature and the governor. It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern.   Another board member, Bridget Ziegler, also tweeted on Wednesday that  if unlawful actions were taken, this development agreement will be nullified.   According to the agreement text, Disney was given a slew of powers including development rights for the next thirty years, or until 2053, and the authority to approve any design improvements.  A  declaration of restrictive covenants  also bars the district from using Disney's name, characters, symbols, or any other Disney-owned intellectual property.  DeSantis has previously said that his new board members will be able to tailor the type of entertainment at the park, though it's unclear how they would be able to do so.   When you lose your way, you gotta have people that are going to tell you the truth,  DeSantis said when signing the law that granted him authority over the district in February.  All these board members very much would like to see the type of entertainment that all families can appreciate.   The agreement DeSantis-appointed members are now objecting to was signed on February 8, a day before the Florida House voted to change the existing governing body.  According to Wednesday's agenda documents, the new district is seeking counsel from four law firms. One of those firms, Cooper & Kirk, has received more than $2.8 million in legal fees and contracts from the DeSantis administration, the Orlando Sentinel reported.   All agreements signed between Disney and the district were appropriate and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine law,  Disney said in a statement to Insider.  DeSantis' communications director, Taryn Fenske, said in an emailed statement to Insider that the  Executive Office of the Governor is aware of Disney's last-ditch efforts to execute contracts just before ratifying the new law that transfers rights and authorities from the former Reedy Creek Improvement District to Disney.    An initial review suggests these agreements may have significant legal infirmities that would render the contracts void as a matter of law,  Fenske wrote.  The new Governor-appointed board retained multiple financial and legal firms to conduct audits and investigate Disney's past behavior.

In an interview with the news outlet Factor.am, Gagik Melkonyan, the deputy of the Armenian National Assembly -- the country's ruling party -- said this week that if Putin were to travel there,  he should be arrested,  according to a translation by The Daily Beast.   It is better for Putin to stay in his country,  Melkonyan said, according to the translation.  If we enter into these agreements, then we must fulfill our obligations. Let Russia solve its problems with Ukraine.   A spokesperson for the Kremlin did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.  Armenia is among a growing group of countries that have said they would enforce an international warrant issued by the International Criminal Court earlier this month. The ICC accused Putin of ordering the abduction of children in occupied parts of Ukraine -- which would be considered a war crime.  Germany, Ireland, Austria, and Croatia have already said they would enforce the warrant, while the UK and France welcomed ICC's decision, but did not comment on whether they would commit to arresting the Russian leader.  Despite being a signatory to the Rome Statute -- the treaty that established the ICC -- Russian ally Hungary said last week that they would not arrest Putin, Reuters reported.  Melkonyan's comments are yet another sign of tensions growing between Armenia and Russia.  Earlier this year, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said that he had canceled joint military drills, calling them  inappropriate in the current situation,  the Associated Press reported.  In a Collective Security Treaty Organization summit last year, Putin was repeatedly snubbed by Pashinyan, including when the Armenian prime minister refused to be photographed in close proximity to him.  The CSTO is a Russian-dominated alliance of post-Soviet nations, which includes Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan  The fall-out is largely also the result of a domestic dispute. Pashinyan has previously accused Russian peacekeepers of failing to take a more active role around the disputed separatist region of Nagorno-Karabak.  Nagorno-Karabakh has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces since a separatist war there ended in 1994.

Bidding starts April 24 , with the starting bid at $2.5 million and a 10% buyer's premium. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  We're not moving from this home for financial reasons. We're moving to simplify our lives.  We're empty nesters -- it's just me and my wife now. It's a big house, and you have to manage it.  People always talk about people who live in castles,  What is it like living in this big castle with just the two of you?   The key question is which one of us will predecease the other. I asked my wife,  Would you want to be in this big home alone?  She said she'd leave the next day. I said the same thing. I just don't want to be in this big home by myself.  We found a home 3 miles away that we felt comfortable in at our age.  I'm expecting a loss, but we've already got our money's worth out of the home   I always dreamt, if I ever made it in life, I wanted a limestone home. So that was my condition,  Roberts said. Interluxe Auctions  We built this home in 2004 and put in $12 million to build it. The replacement value, done by AIG, is $21 million. It's been like that for five years.  We had the resources to build what we wanted, and we built our dream home. Our builder had an unlimited budget -- I kid around and say he still found a way to exceed it.  We had 19 wonderful years here, and we never really thought we would get a return on our investment. We're at peace knowing that. We got our money's worth.  An auction is the best way. The auction house recommended $2.5 million be an entry point, and we trust their expertise. We don't want to do anything to discourage anyone from participating in the auction.  Even though the house is in Texas, it features traces of our early lives in Chicago  My wife really built this home.  The only conditions I had were that it would be large enough for the entertaining we wanted to do and that this home would be built from limestone.  I was born and raised on the west side of Chicago. My family didn't have much.  We never went anywhere on vacation outside of Chicago. But every summer we would look forward to our summer vacation, which was basically going to the museums of Chicago -- they're all limestone. And so I fell in love with limestone.  I always dreamt, if I ever made it in life, I wanted a limestone home. So that was my condition.  I met my wife in Chicago when I was 16, and there's a home theater in the house that goes back to our Chicago days.  As teenagers, we went to the Marbro Theatre. It was during those days when they had very ornate theaters for movies.  Roberts' home theater replicates the Marbro Theatre in Chicago. Interluxe Auctions  We searched high and low and we found the exact plans of that theater -- the colors, the way the ceiling was made, the materials they used for the walls -- and we duplicated that design in our home theater. The only thing that's different are the seats we sit in.  It's one of my favorite rooms.  I built this home to host some of the biggest fundraisers in Fort Worth  We did a lot of entertaining in this home, due to my position as the CEO of the largest corporation in Fort Worth. That all stopped when I retired in 2006.  The estate sits on 1.82 acres. Interluxe Auctions  We orchestrated some of the biggest galas and charity events in Fort Worth, Texas, in this beautiful home. We've hosted at least 100 events. Everyone who's anyone has been in this home having dinner -- sometimes 250 people.  We built this house with 120 audio speakers because we knew we were going to have a lot of events here, and when you host a charity you're always going to have a featured speaker.  I didn't want people to stop what they were doing to come squeeze in, like you normally have to, and listen to somebody talk. I wanted them to be able to relax, listen to whatever the speaker was going to talk about.  Roberts says he's hosted more than 100 events at this home. Interluxe Auctions  We're leaving the PA infrastructure there. So whoever buys this home is going to get a home that is very ready to entertain and to host events.  We hope that whoever gets this house will make it as available to the community as we have."}, {"source": "business-insider-uk", "title": "California's 'Mansion Tax' means discounts for LA palaces and manors", "text": "Los Angeles homeowners looking to sell their multimillion dollar homes are in a rush to sell this week.

A new tax approved by Los Angeles voters in November and going into effect April 1 will tack millions in expenses onto some of LA's priciest real estate transactions. Critics have told the New York Times and The Hollywood Reporter that the new tax will only encourage developers to build new homes outside of Los Angeles to avoid the new tax.  LA voters approved Proposition ULA, commonly referred to as the  mansion tax,  by a 58% to 42% margin. The ballot measure proposed an additional tax on high-value real estate transactions; the estimated $600 million to $1.1 billion in tax revenue would go to fund affordable housing and homelessness prevention programs.  The new ordinance mandates that the seller pays a 4% tax on property sales between $5 million and $10 million, and a 5.5% tax on sales over $10 million. Because it goes into effect soon -- April 1 -- some of the more expensive homes on the market are steeply discounted in an attempt to sell before then.  Included in that group is the Star Resort being sold by Ikon Advisors, currently on the market for $6 million less than the current owner paid for it two years ago, according to CNBC.

The tax's calculator website says it is applied on top of LA's existing property transfer tax of 0.45%. Sellers have to pay the tax regardless of whether they are making a profit or losing money on a transaction.  Dan Malka, of Ikon Advisors, told CNBC that the discounted price means his company represents a seller that is motivated to get a deal done as soon as possible, and said the price will go up to at least $41 million once the new tax is in effect, with no intention of accepting offers below that price.

Thinking I had some time to spare before the party, I decided to drop by.  Upon arrival, I found two unfamiliar guys. One of them had driven from Philadelphia for the weekend. He had rented a car for a month and wanted to travel around. I didn't have a driver's license and was melting from the heat. We hit it off, and within 10 minutes, decided to take a trip outside the city together.  We set off for Montauk, on Long Island, two weeks later and spent the day together before heading to separate sleeping spots. He drove me back, and I showed him my favorite neighborhood, Brooklyn's Williamsburg, before he took off for Philly at 2 a.m.  Another two weeks passed, and he expressed an interest in moving to New York to learn more about the city. The best places seemed to be in Williamsburg, he said, and so he rented an apartment in my neighborhood.  He told me he wasn't ready for anything serious  Though we felt romantic, I sensed he was holding back on any relationship progression, often claiming he was too busy with work or tired to stay over. Two months later, he told me he wasn't ready for a relationship, which I interpreted as a cue to end. In my head, something either moves forward or backward, so I pulled out.  We didn't text each other for a week. I was coping by meeting with my girlfriends and drinking cocktails. Then one afternoon, he texted me and asked to give it another try.  He explained that he was hesitant to commit because he was recently coming out a marriage and wanted to focus on his career. I didn't mind, I said, but we would either be in a relationship, or I'd rather not spend more time on casual dating. So we started to date again.  Despite my gut feeling of him being, as my friend put it,  good marriage material,  he was often talking about something that he had missed and things he had to try before committing to something serious. A yearlong relationship was already serious, I thought. I was confused, but I loved him, so we kept going.  I wanted to know if we were headed toward having a family together  When we hit a year and a half, I wanted to know whether we were headed toward having a family or not.  I needed to set a deadline for when he would commit to marriage and having a kid together. I chose August 2022, which would mark two years of our relationship.  I was also afraid of losing my guy, so I began pushing him harder to commit to marriage. I became fixated on that idea, and every time we were watching a show where people would get married or have kids, I would burst into tears.  As my behavior became more erratic, my boyfriend started pulling away. At this point, I gave him an ultimatum: Either we get married, or we break up. Although I don't like playing ultimatum games, I didn't know what else to do.  He wasn't ready.  After a week of depression, he packed up his belongings and left for Europe. We didn't speak for two months, during which time I decided to download dating apps.  I made it a rule to go on at least one date a week to move on from my ex and find someone who shared my family plans and values. My therapist had helped me outline the qualities and values I was looking for, and I could weed out all the guys that didn't fit.  He proposed at my front door  The dates were great, but I did not feel any chemistry. So when my ex showed up out of the blue two months later, my goosebumps and warm feelings for him immediately returned. He was standing at my door -- in a gray sweater that I bought for him, with a huge bouquet of red roses, apparently confident that there was no chance I could have moved on and there was someone else in my room.  He got down on one knee and pulled out a ring. I said yes.  He told me he had to leave to figure out what he wanted, without my pressure. At first, he tried to imagine his life without me and went on a couple of dates in Europe. But he missed me and always thought about me, he said. Once he had the space to think about it, he was ready for commitment.  My now husband has never been so stable in his work and our relationship. He talks about getting a house together, kids, and building our future more than I do. Last week, he came home from a tough negotiation meeting. He said when he looked at the ring on his finger, he felt strength and support.  This marriage has been my best decision,  he said. And kissed me on the lips.

A gamma-ray burst that recently hit our solar system was so bright, it temporarily blinded gamma-ray instruments in space, according to a NASA release.  Scientists say the gamma-ray burst (GRB), the most powerful type of explosion in the universe, was 70 times brighter than any previously recorded event.  They dubbed it  the BOAT,  or  brightest of all time.   What is a gamma-ray burst?  A GRB is basically a black hole's first breath into existence. And it's a spectacular one.  When a supermassive star nears the end of its life -- when it's no longer generating enough fuel in its core to support its sheer mass -- it collapses under its own weight, forming a black hole.  Two things happen during this process: First, the collapse generates an explosion called a supernova. Second, the resulting black hole is born into a massive cloud of residual gas and dust, where it proceeds to quickly gobble it all up.  Residual gas and dust surrounding a black hole leads to powerful jets, called gamma-ray bursts. NASA Goddard  What comes next has been observed many times but is still a scientific mystery as to why it happens: the black hole burps out two powerful jets of high-energy gamma radiation traveling at near the speed of light, in opposite directions.  These cosmic belches only last for a few seconds but are so bright, that astronomers have documented about 12,000 GRBs. And it's one of these jets that struck our solar system last fall.  The brightest GRB of all time  The Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 revealed the infrared afterglow (circled) of the BOAT GRB and its host galaxy, seen nearly edge-on as a sliver of light extending to the burst's upper right. NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, A. Levan (Radboud University); Image Processing: Gladys Kober  The burst, classified as GRB 221009A, was recorded on October 9, 2022. Because it blinded space instruments, they couldn't accurately record it, so scientists weren't sure how bright the burst was when it first reached our planet.  For the last several months, scientists worldwide -- including in the US, China, and Russia -- have culminated data from other instruments to measure and re-measure the GRB's brightness, determining it was 70 times brighter than any other GRB event in recorded history.  The amount of gamma radiation from GRB 221009A is significantly greater than any other GRB on record. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Adam Goldstein (USRA)  Researchers also examined the likelihood of an event like this happening again and reported that this sort of thing only occurs once every 10,000 years.   GRB 221009A was likely the brightest burst at X-ray and gamma-ray energies to occur since human civilization began,  said Eric Burns, an assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, NASA reported.  Oddly enough, the jets themselves weren't the most powerful on record. What made the GRB so bright was the fact that the jets were narrow and aimed directly at Earth. So, we got a full-on view of it -- sort of like a deer in headlights.  The GRB jets were extremely narrow and aimed directly at Earth. NASA Video  Other GRBs aren't aimed directly at Earth, so we don't detect as much of their radiation and they appear dimmer.  The researchers recently announced their findings at the American Astronomical Society's High Energy Astrophysics Division and published the results in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.  But astronomers aren't done. They're hopeful that this GRB could help solve the mystery of why black holes burp out GRBs in the first place. One theory is already in place that the jets were powered by a magnetic field that the black hole amplified as it began to spin. (Yes, black holes can spin.)  Additional observations through the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble Space Telescope are planned over the next few months."}, {"source": "cnn-es", "title": "Peru retira a su embajador en Colombia por  expresiones injerencistas y ofensivas  de Petro sobre situacion de Castillo | CNN", "text": " Castillo violo la constitucion , dice Duque 0:41  (CNN Espanol) -- El Gobierno de Peru informo este miercoles que ha dispuesto el  retiro definitivo  de su embajador en Colombia, debido a las declaraciones del presidente de Colombia Gustavo Petro en torno a la situacion del expresidente de Peru, Pedro Castillo.

But a previously signed agreement may have rendered the new governing board powerless.  Top editors give you the stories you want -- delivered right to your inbox each weekday.

Ron DeSantis' move to take over Walt Disney World's governing board in Florida may have backfired due to a prior obscure agreement that new governor-appointed board members say stripped them of their power.  The contentious agreement, approved without fanfare a day before DeSantis assumed more control of Disney's land, is the latest in an apparent feud between the governor and the company.  And in setting the expiration terms of the agreement, Disney invoked an obscure property law known as Rule Against Perpetuities, setting the date for  twenty one (21) years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England living as of the date of this Declaration.    This essentially makes Disney the government,  Ron Peri, a member of the board, said during a meeting on Wednesday.  This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.   For close to six decades, Disney has operated its expansive theme park and resort in Florida under a specially designated district that lies between two counties. A board, previously known as Reedy Creek Improvement District, oversaw the area and had free reign of development processes, such as zoning and infrastructure, and even control of its own fire department, essentially operating like a separate municipal government. Disney also had the authority to appoint district board members.  This special status came under threat when Disney entered the fray of DeSantis' culture war last year, after the company publicly objected to Florida's proposal to ban the discussion of sexual orientation in K-3 public classrooms.  In a show of political force, DeSantis, who is a likely contender for the 2024 Republican nomination, attempted to dissolve the Reedy Creek district. But the dissolution would have placed the burden of paying for a fire department and road maintenance, among other services, onto taxpayers in Orange and Osceola counties. Residents would also have had to pick up the district's hefty $1 billion debt.  Instead, Florida lawmakers passed a bill in February to end  Disney's self-governing status  and give the governor the authority to appoint new board members to the district. Reedy Creek was renamed to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, and DeSantis appointed five supervisors, including a parents' rights activist and three Republican donors.  But the new supervisors are now saying that previous board members entered an agreement that effectively stripped them of their powers.   We're going to have to deal with it and correct it,  Brian Aungst, a member of the board, said during a meeting on Wednesday.  It's a subversion of the will of the voters and the Legislature and the governor. It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern.   Another board member, Bridget Ziegler, also tweeted on Wednesday that  if unlawful actions were taken, this development agreement will be nullified.   According to the agreement text, Disney was given a slew of powers including development rights for the next thirty years, or until 2053, and the authority to approve any design improvements.  A  declaration of restrictive covenants  also bars the district from using Disney's name, characters, symbols, or any other Disney-owned intellectual property.  DeSantis has previously said that his new board members will be able to tailor the type of entertainment at the park, though it's unclear how they would be able to do so.   When you lose your way, you gotta have people that are going to tell you the truth,  DeSantis said when signing the law that granted him authority over the district in February.  All these board members very much would like to see the type of entertainment that all families can appreciate.   The agreement DeSantis-appointed members are now objecting to was signed on February 8, a day before the Florida House voted to change the existing governing body.  According to Wednesday's agenda documents, the new district is seeking counsel from four law firms. One of those firms, Cooper & Kirk, has received more than $2.8 million in legal fees and contracts from the DeSantis administration, the Orlando Sentinel reported.   All agreements signed between Disney and the district were appropriate and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine law,  Disney said in a statement to Insider.  DeSantis' communications director, Taryn Fenske, said in an emailed statement to Insider that the  Executive Office of the Governor is aware of Disney's last-ditch efforts to execute contracts just before ratifying the new law that transfers rights and authorities from the former Reedy Creek Improvement District to Disney.    An initial review suggests these agreements may have significant legal infirmities that would render the contracts void as a matter of law,  Fenske wrote.  The new Governor-appointed board retained multiple financial and legal firms to conduct audits and investigate Disney's past behavior.

Bidding starts April 24 , with the starting bid at $2.5 million and a 10% buyer's premium. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  We're not moving from this home for financial reasons. We're moving to simplify our lives.  We're empty nesters -- it's just me and my wife now. It's a big house, and you have to manage it.  People always talk about people who live in castles,  What is it like living in this big castle with just the two of you?   The key question is which one of us will predecease the other. I asked my wife,  Would you want to be in this big home alone?  She said she'd leave the next day. I said the same thing. I just don't want to be in this big home by myself.  We found a home 3 miles away that we felt comfortable in at our age.  I'm expecting a loss, but we've already got our money's worth out of the home   I always dreamt, if I ever made it in life, I wanted a limestone home. So that was my condition,  Roberts said. Interluxe Auctions  We built this home in 2004 and put in $12 million to build it. The replacement value, done by AIG, is $21 million. It's been like that for five years.  We had the resources to build what we wanted, and we built our dream home. Our builder had an unlimited budget -- I kid around and say he still found a way to exceed it.  We had 19 wonderful years here, and we never really thought we would get a return on our investment. We're at peace knowing that. We got our money's worth.  An auction is the best way. The auction house recommended $2.5 million be an entry point, and we trust their expertise. We don't want to do anything to discourage anyone from participating in the auction.  Even though the house is in Texas, it features traces of our early lives in Chicago  My wife really built this home.  The only conditions I had were that it would be large enough for the entertaining we wanted to do and that this home would be built from limestone.  I was born and raised on the west side of Chicago. My family didn't have much.  We never went anywhere on vacation outside of Chicago. But every summer we would look forward to our summer vacation, which was basically going to the museums of Chicago -- they're all limestone. And so I fell in love with limestone.  I always dreamt, if I ever made it in life, I wanted a limestone home. So that was my condition.  I met my wife in Chicago when I was 16, and there's a home theater in the house that goes back to our Chicago days.  As teenagers, we went to the Marbro Theatre. It was during those days when they had very ornate theaters for movies.  Roberts' home theater replicates the Marbro Theatre in Chicago. Interluxe Auctions  We searched high and low and we found the exact plans of that theater -- the colors, the way the ceiling was made, the materials they used for the walls -- and we duplicated that design in our home theater. The only thing that's different are the seats we sit in.  It's one of my favorite rooms.  I built this home to host some of the biggest fundraisers in Fort Worth  We did a lot of entertaining in this home, due to my position as the CEO of the largest corporation in Fort Worth. That all stopped when I retired in 2006.  The estate sits on 1.82 acres. Interluxe Auctions  We orchestrated some of the biggest galas and charity events in Fort Worth, Texas, in this beautiful home. We've hosted at least 100 events. Everyone who's anyone has been in this home having dinner -- sometimes 250 people.  We built this house with 120 audio speakers because we knew we were going to have a lot of events here, and when you host a charity you're always going to have a featured speaker.  I didn't want people to stop what they were doing to come squeeze in, like you normally have to, and listen to somebody talk. I wanted them to be able to relax, listen to whatever the speaker was going to talk about.  Roberts says he's hosted more than 100 events at this home. Interluxe Auctions  We're leaving the PA infrastructure there. So whoever buys this home is going to get a home that is very ready to entertain and to host events.  We hope that whoever gets this house will make it as available to the community as we have."}, {"source": "business-insider", "title": "Office doom loop: landlords face a reckoning as companies move to fancy offices", "text": "Gas Company Tower was once a gleaming model of downtown America's ascendancy. Located squarely in Los Angeles' central business district, the 52-story skyscraper has a strong pedigree. It's home to a collection of major corporate tenants, including the Southern California Gas Company, the white-shoe law firm Sidley Austin, and Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms. Its owner, Brookfield, is an $800 billion investment firm known for its blue-chip portfolio of real-estate assets. The tower's lobby even had a Hollywood cameo when it was featured in the opening shot of the 1994 film  Speed.   More recently, though, the glassy office property has become an example of the alarming financial turmoil that is engulfing once-bedrock real-estate assets. Brookfield disclosed in a February filing that a subsidiary it controls had defaulted on $753.9 million worth of debt tied to the tower and another nearby office building -- one of the largest since the great financial crisis. But as Brookfield grapples with its lenders, it's also facing a potential exodus of the building's most visible occupants.  The Southern California Gas Company, the Gas Company Tower's namesake tenant, is in the market to relocate its 360,000 square feet at the property. Sidley Austin, which has about 136,000 square feet in the 1991-vintage building, is also prowling the market for new space, according to two people with knowledge of both tenants' real-estate decision-making. Spokespeople for Sidley and Brookfield declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Southern California Gas Company did not reply to a request for comment.  Brookfield has slim chances of holding on to the occupants, market experts say, without promising the perfunctory upgrades that landlords often rely on to entice tenants, such as improvements to the building's lobby, amenity spaces, and outdoor areas. With its future control of the tower in jeopardy, the investment giant is hardly in a position to lavish the millions of dollars necessary to undertake such renovations.  The situation at the Gas Company Tower is the latest example of the doom loop taking hold in America's office market, where snowballing disinvestment and financial distress have ensnared a growing number of buildings.  The Gas Company Tower in downtown Los Angeles has a sterling pedigree, but even that can't save it from the doom loop facing many older office towers. Mitch Diamond/Getty Images  The brewing problems can be traced to a fundamental shift in office demand. Remote and hybrid work has transformed office attendance and allowed companies to cut back on their physical footprints. It has also made tenants more choosy about the spaces they do take, favoring offices with the  wow factor  to draw employees back in. It's not only staid properties that risk being left behind -- even offices that do boast amenities can fall short of tenants' rising expectations.   For years, office owners have been in an amenities war, spending millions of dollars on upgrades,  Michael Soto, the head of US office research at Savills in Los Angeles, said.  The competition has reached the point where an owner can complete these upgrades and it might not even be enough to push leasing activity.   Rising interest rates, higher operating costs, and reticent lenders, meanwhile, present another financial hurdle for landlords who are contemplating spending tens of millions of dollars on upgrades. Those owners may have to spend huge sums to pay down expiring mortgages that have become outsized in the current lending market as commercial properties fall in value.  A huge swath of America's office market is vulnerable to these twin threats of being under-equipped with amenities and underwater financially. Seventy percent of the country's 5.56 billion square feet of total office space was built before 1990, according to a recent report issued by the real-estate giant Cushman & Wakefield, and is more likely in need of substantial upgrades to remain competitive. Almost $400 billion of office debt, meanwhile, is set to come due in the next 5 years, saddling owners simultaneously with refinancing costs that are likely to tally in the tens of billions of dollars.  'Tenants are taking less space'  Landlords insist that the pessimism in the sector is overblown and that diminished office attendance will be a pandemic-era fad. A growing number of companies are forcing workers back. But there is also growing evidence that remote work could become a permanent offshoot of the pandemic. Placer.ai, a real-estate-data firm that tracks office attendance, said in a recent report that there are currently about 40% fewer workers in the office on an average workday than before the pandemic. That rate has held steady since mid-2022, signaling  the entrenchment of a new hybrid normal,  the report stated.   We had been seeing a steady recovery of occupancy, but now it's flattening,  Ethan Chernofsky, a senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, said.  What it tells me is the current situation is far closer to the new normal than I had expected it would be.   This behavioral shift has deeply cut into demand for office space. Cushman predicted that 1.1 billion square feet, or nearly a fifth of the entire US office market, would be empty by the end of the decade -- a 55% increase in vacant space compared to the end of 2019, just before the pandemic began. Space reductions created by remote and hybrid work would account for about 330 million square feet of that vacancy, the report said. There's also been a major uptick in companies subleasing parts of their offices as their needs for space shrink, the real estate services firm Colliers said. Sublease space is often offered at a discount compared to spaces being marketed directly by landlords, putting more downward pressure on the leasing market -- and by extension, building values. The amount of sublease space nationally more than doubled from 118.5 million square feet at the end of 2019 to 242.8 million square feet at the end of 2022, Colliers stated.   There's no doubt that tenants are taking less space now,  Aaron Jodka, a research director at Colliers, said.  Anecdotally, we're seeing many users take about 20% less space during lease renewals.   The tenants that do remain in the market for offices have become more particular about the spaces they take, according to real-estate experts, and for good reason. Companies have found that employees are more willing to trek into the office if a space and the building it's in are compelling enough to make the commute worth it.   We're seeing tenants move out of commodity spaces and into the very best offices they can afford,  David Smith, Cushman & Wakefield's head of global occupier insights, said.  It's left older spaces that haven't seen reinvestment less likely to find takers.   The double whammy of businesses needing less space and wanting only the nicest offices means that competition for tenants is even fiercer. For older buildings trying to survive, a physical overhaul may be the only option to remain relevant.  A different formula  Transforming a building with older bones into a high-quality, modern office tower has never been easy, but it generally followed a well-worn blueprint: borrow money for the work, hire brand-name architects, install the latest amenities and shiny upgrades that businesses want, and then wait for those tenants to rush through the door.  Rockefeller Group, a New York-based real-estate-development firm owned by the Japanese real-estate conglomerate Mitsubishi Estate Group, executed this playbook with the office tower it owns at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan. Rockefeller spent $600 million renovating the 2-million-square-foot property between 2016 to 2020, redoing the building's block-wide lobby and replacing its facade with a new glass exterior. All that investment paid off, as a collection of top-tier tenants filled virtually all of the tower's space: the corporate offices of Major League Baseball, the law firm Latham & Watkins, the Japan-based bank Mizuho, and others.  Rockefeller Group, the owner of 1271 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown, Manhattan, was able to entice new tenants with a $600 million renovation. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images  But Bill Edwards, an executive vice president at Rockefeller who helps oversee its New York portfolio, said that it might have reconsidered the scale of such a thorough and costly makeover today.   We would probably have reconsidered that dollar amount given how leasing costs have increased tremendously,  Edwards said, referring to the incentives landlords award tenants to take space, including periods of free rent, rent discounts, and contributions to the costs of setting up their offices.  The fact that tenant improvement and free rent periods are much more elevated would affect the math.   At 1221 Avenue of the Americas, an almost identical-looking office tower a block away that the company also owns, Rockefeller has recently completed a more modest $50 million makeover of the building's expansive outdoor plaza along Sixth Avenue, where it has 65,000 square feet of retail space it hopes to lease to a mix of stores, fitness centers, and restaurants that will serve as a draw for tenants. It previously upgraded the plazas on the north and south sides of the tower and, in 2015, redid the lobby. About 20% of the building's leased space, totaling roughly 500,000 square feet, is set to expire beginning in 2025, meaning the tenants in those spaces could depart. For now, the company doesn't have any further work planned to lure takers.   This is a time in the market where you want to be cautious about investments and make sure you're managing the downside risks,  Edwards said.  Spiral to the deep  The financial gambit of lavishing money on upgrades has become even more challenging as cracks have formed in the financial foundations that underpin a growing number of office properties. About $80 billion of office mortgages on bank balance sheets are coming due in 2023, according to data from Trepp, and $400 billion will expire in the next 5 years, more than any other segment of the commercial real estate market.  If a property is underwater, investing in more cash can be seen as putting good money after bad  Commercial real-estate financing is generally structured differently than residential mortgages. The loans often don't amortize and include only interest payments, meaning that when they expire, usually after a period of 10 years, owners must replace them with mortgages of commensurate size. In a market where building values have fallen -- the National Council of Real Estate Investment estimated that average office values reported by its members fell 7.4% in 2022 -- and lenders have become more cautious, that swap has become increasingly difficult.  Data from Trepp suggests that at least a quarter of the roughly $68.3 billion of securitized mortgages tied to office buildings and set to expire in the next two years is too large to be fully replaced, considering the rental income of the office buildings they're tied to. The disconnect leaves owners with huge sums to pay down. If a landlord has, for instance, an expiring $100 million mortgage, but can only find $70 million of debt to replace it because of the lower value of their building and the more cautious lending standards of banks, that owner must pay the $30 million difference or risk turning the property back to its lender.   If a property is underwater, investing in more cash can be seen as putting good money after bad,  Soto said, explaining why even landlords like Brookfield, which faced a debt maturity at the Gas Company Tower in February, have chosen to default rather than pay up.  This leaves owners, their buildings, and the wider office market in a precarious position. Robert Verrone, a principal at Iron Hound, a commercial real-estate-financing firm and advisor, said he now spends the majority of his time working on ailing debts. Lenders are often reluctant, he said, to seize office buildings because of the costs and expertise required to operate the properties. In some cases, a compromise can be struck in which an owner pays back a portion of their loan in exchange for forgiveness on some of the debt by the lender. Few lenders have been in a forgiving mood so far, but that could change, Verrone said.   They're being tougher now than in 2010,  Verrone said, referring to the workouts that became commonplace in the aftermath of the great financial crisis.  But you can get a deal done if you negotiate.   Lenders with troubled loans may also resort to selling off those debts to investors who are intent on seizing properties through foreclosure. But the discounts will be steep. On a call Wednesday hosted by CBRE, Spencer Levy, a global client strategist and senior economic advisor at the company, said that it has increasingly been called on by lenders to help them value their commercial real estate loan portfolios and identify potential debts to sell.   We are currently valuing those deals in an enormously wide band,  Levy said of office loans, in particular.  50 to 90 cents on the dollar.

Becker salio de la prision de Huntercombe en diciembre tras cumplir solamente ocho meses de su condena de dos anos y medio por cargos relacionados con su caso de bancarrota de 2017.  Poco despues de su liberacion, Becker declaro a la emisora alemana Sat 1 que un  recluso intento matarlo  durante su encarcelamiento.   Me siento muy bien (por haber salido) , dijo Becker a Amanpour.  Solo aprecias la libertad una vez que estuviste encarcelado, dejame decirte. Es un estilo de vida diferente, es un mundo diferente. Hace mas de tres meses que sali y estoy contento de estar aqui vivo y hablando con ustedes.   La vida en la carcel es un lugar muy peligroso. Vi un par de peliculas antes para prepararme un poco, pero no me lo esperaba asi. Da mucho miedo. Es un verdadero castigo. Quiero decir, se supone que la carcel es eso, pero es un castigo real que te quita la libertad, tu medio de vida , dijo.  publicidad  Y anadio:  La unica moneda de cambio que tienes es tu caracter y tu personalidad --literalmente-- y mas te vale hacerte amigo de los chicos fuertes porque necesitas proteccion, necesitas un grupo de gente que te cuide .  'Me ganaste con Boris'  Seis veces campeon del Grand Slam, el extenista de 55 anos hablo con Amanpour antes del estreno de un nuevo documental sobre su vida y su carrera, titulado  Boom! Boom! The World vs. Boris Becker .  El documental de dos partes, que se emite el 7 de abril en Apple TV, es obra del director ganador del Oscar Alex Gibney y del productor ganador del Oscar John Battsek, que tuvieron acceso especial a Becker durante mas de tres anos hasta su sentencia en abril de 2022.   Al principio me intrigaba hacer un documental sobre Boris porque era un gran aficionado al tenis, por supuesto, y Boris es uno de los grandes jugadores de todos los tiempos , dijo Gibney a Amanpour.   Asi que cuando John Battsek se me acerco y me dijo: '?Te interesaria hacer esto?', le dije: 'Me ganaste con Boris'.   Pero la otra cosa que me parecio interesante es que habia visto a Boris hacer un cameo en una pelicula titulada 'Love Means Zero' y es raro encontrar a un atleta de la talla de Boris que pueda hablar tan elocuentemente como Boris sobre el deporte y tambien sobre los elementos psicologicos del tenis .   Asi que fue la habilidad de Boris como jugador, pero tambien como narrador, lo que realmente me intrigo para hacer la historia , aseguro.  El documental refleja el meteorico ascenso al estrellato de Becker tras ganar Wimbledon con solo 17 anos y su vida personal de alto nivel.  ?Que lleva a la carcel a Boris Becker? 2:15  Becker llego a ganar 49 titulos, incluidos seis Grand Slam y el oro olimpico, durante una ilustre carrera, antes de convertirse en locutor de tenis y entrenador --sobre todo de Novak Djokovic-- una vez finalizada su carrera como jugador.  Gibney explica que le intrigaba la posibilidad de contar la historia del ascenso y la caida de Becker, asi como lo que el llama el arco de redencion de la leyenda alemana.   Empezamos a explorar un poco mas a fondo algunas de las circunstancias que llevaron a Boris a la carcel e hicimos una larga entrevista con Boris justo tres dias antes de ser sentenciado, cuando no sabia que le iba a pasar exactamente , dice Gibney.   Fue en ese momento cuando se enfrento honestamente a su vida, de una forma que resulta muy impactante en la pelicula, pero al final de la historia se vislumbra una historia de redencion. Es decir, cometio algunos errores, pago por ellos y ahora Boris tiene la oportunidad de escribir un nuevo capitulo , anadio.  'Estoy listo para volver'  Becker reflexiona sobre su vida del mismo modo que lo hace sobre un partido de tenis, utilizando sus victorias desde dos sets abajo como metafora de donde se encuentra actualmente.  En el tenis, como en la vida, las cosas  nunca fueron faciles  y  siempre hubo que luchar un poco , recuerda Becker.   Pero el punto mas importante es el ultimo, no el primero, y mi plan es ganar mi ultimo punto , dice.   Esa es la linea roja de toda mi vida profesional y privada; si, paso por pruebas y tribulaciones, a veces por las razones correctas o incorrectas, pero nunca me rindo. Cuando Alex hablaba del proximo capitulo, yo estoy construyendo mi tercer capitulo, probablemente el ultimo, mientras hablamos , agrega.   Si, deberia haber hecho esto y lo otro, pero en retrospectiva siempre eres mas listo. Hice lo que hice, pague mis deudas y estoy listo para volver .  Becker dice que tuvo  bastante tiempo de reflexion  mientras estuvo en la carcel, pensando en los errores que habia cometido, pero que cualquier sensacion de  autocompasion  no duro mucho, ya que  tienes que levantarte al dia siguiente y, literalmente, sobrevivir .  Becker califica la vida en prision de  lucha por la supervivencia  diaria.  El tenista de 55 anos tambien rememoro algunos buenos recuerdos mientras estuvo encarcelado, su remontada en cuatro sets contra Andre Agassi en la semifinal de Wimbledon de 1995, un partido en particular en el que penso  una o dos veces .   Si la carcel no te hace humilde, no se que lo hara , dice Becker.  Cuando literalmente lo pierdes todo y te metes en una celda muy pequena durante 231 dias, si eso no te humilla entonces estas perdido de todos modos , afirmo.   He tenido tiempo para no olvidar de donde vengo, pero no siempre ha sido malo. Tengo cosas buenas, victorias, conoci a gente buena por el camino. Especialmente los dos ultimos anos, cuando tienes dificultades, cuando estas realmente perdido, la cantidad de gente que esta contigo se va a cada momento , agrega.  Y concluye:  Solo un punado de personas se quedaron y gracias a ellas nunca perdi la esperanza. Forman parte de mi nuevo equipo que intenta ayudarme a volver .

"}, {"source": "business-insider-uk", "title": "Office doom loop: landlords face a reckoning as companies move to fancy offices", "text": "Gas Company Tower was once a gleaming model of downtown America's ascendancy. Located squarely in Los Angeles' central business district, the 52-story skyscraper has a strong pedigree. It's home to a collection of major corporate tenants, including the Southern California Gas Company, the white-shoe law firm Sidley Austin, and Deloitte, one of the Big Four accounting firms. Its owner, Brookfield, is an $800 billion investment firm known for its blue-chip portfolio of real-estate assets. The tower's lobby even had a Hollywood cameo when it was featured in the opening shot of the 1994 film  Speed.   More recently, though, the glassy office property has become an example of the alarming financial turmoil that is engulfing once-bedrock real-estate assets. Brookfield disclosed in a February filing that a subsidiary it controls had defaulted on $753.9 million worth of debt tied to the tower and another nearby office building -- one of the largest since the great financial crisis. But as Brookfield grapples with its lenders, it's also facing a potential exodus of the building's most visible occupants.  The Southern California Gas Company, the Gas Company Tower's namesake tenant, is in the market to relocate its 360,000 square feet at the property. Sidley Austin, which has about 136,000 square feet in the 1991-vintage building, is also prowling the market for new space, according to two people with knowledge of both tenants' real-estate decision-making. Spokespeople for Sidley and Brookfield declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Southern California Gas Company did not reply to a request for comment.  Brookfield has slim chances of holding on to the occupants, market experts say, without promising the perfunctory upgrades that landlords often rely on to entice tenants, such as improvements to the building's lobby, amenity spaces, and outdoor areas. With its future control of the tower in jeopardy, the investment giant is hardly in a position to lavish the millions of dollars necessary to undertake such renovations.  The situation at the Gas Company Tower is the latest example of the doom loop taking hold in America's office market, where snowballing disinvestment and financial distress have ensnared a growing number of buildings.  The Gas Company Tower in downtown Los Angeles has a sterling pedigree, but even that can't save it from the doom loop facing many older office towers. Mitch Diamond/Getty Images  The brewing problems can be traced to a fundamental shift in office demand. Remote and hybrid work has transformed office attendance and allowed companies to cut back on their physical footprints. It has also made tenants more choosy about the spaces they do take, favoring offices with the  wow factor  to draw employees back in. It's not only staid properties that risk being left behind -- even offices that do boast amenities can fall short of tenants' rising expectations.   For years, office owners have been in an amenities war, spending millions of dollars on upgrades,  Michael Soto, the head of US office research at Savills in Los Angeles, said.  The competition has reached the point where an owner can complete these upgrades and it might not even be enough to push leasing activity.   Rising interest rates, higher operating costs, and reticent lenders, meanwhile, present another financial hurdle for landlords who are contemplating spending tens of millions of dollars on upgrades. Those owners may have to spend huge sums to pay down expiring mortgages that have become outsized in the current lending market as commercial properties fall in value.  A huge swath of America's office market is vulnerable to these twin threats of being under-equipped with amenities and underwater financially. Seventy percent of the country's 5.56 billion square feet of total office space was built before 1990, according to a recent report issued by the real-estate giant Cushman & Wakefield, and is more likely in need of substantial upgrades to remain competitive. Almost $400 billion of office debt, meanwhile, is set to come due in the next 5 years, saddling owners simultaneously with refinancing costs that are likely to tally in the tens of billions of dollars.  'Tenants are taking less space'  Landlords insist that the pessimism in the sector is overblown and that diminished office attendance will be a pandemic-era fad. A growing number of companies are forcing workers back. But there is also growing evidence that remote work could become a permanent offshoot of the pandemic. Placer.ai, a real-estate-data firm that tracks office attendance, said in a recent report that there are currently about 40% fewer workers in the office on an average workday than before the pandemic. That rate has held steady since mid-2022, signaling  the entrenchment of a new hybrid normal,  the report stated.   We had been seeing a steady recovery of occupancy, but now it's flattening,  Ethan Chernofsky, a senior vice president of marketing at Placer.ai, said.  What it tells me is the current situation is far closer to the new normal than I had expected it would be.   This behavioral shift has deeply cut into demand for office space. Cushman predicted that 1.1 billion square feet, or nearly a fifth of the entire US office market, would be empty by the end of the decade -- a 55% increase in vacant space compared to the end of 2019, just before the pandemic began. Space reductions created by remote and hybrid work would account for about 330 million square feet of that vacancy, the report said. There's also been a major uptick in companies subleasing parts of their offices as their needs for space shrink, the real estate services firm Colliers said. Sublease space is often offered at a discount compared to spaces being marketed directly by landlords, putting more downward pressure on the leasing market -- and by extension, building values. The amount of sublease space nationally more than doubled from 118.5 million square feet at the end of 2019 to 242.8 million square feet at the end of 2022, Colliers stated.   There's no doubt that tenants are taking less space now,  Aaron Jodka, a research director at Colliers, said.  Anecdotally, we're seeing many users take about 20% less space during lease renewals.   The tenants that do remain in the market for offices have become more particular about the spaces they take, according to real-estate experts, and for good reason. Companies have found that employees are more willing to trek into the office if a space and the building it's in are compelling enough to make the commute worth it.   We're seeing tenants move out of commodity spaces and into the very best offices they can afford,  David Smith, Cushman & Wakefield's head of global occupier insights, said.  It's left older spaces that haven't seen reinvestment less likely to find takers.   The double whammy of businesses needing less space and wanting only the nicest offices means that competition for tenants is even fiercer. For older buildings trying to survive, a physical overhaul may be the only option to remain relevant.  A different formula  Transforming a building with older bones into a high-quality, modern office tower has never been easy, but it generally followed a well-worn blueprint: borrow money for the work, hire brand-name architects, install the latest amenities and shiny upgrades that businesses want, and then wait for those tenants to rush through the door.  Rockefeller Group, a New York-based real-estate-development firm owned by the Japanese real-estate conglomerate Mitsubishi Estate Group, executed this playbook with the office tower it owns at 1271 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan. Rockefeller spent $600 million renovating the 2-million-square-foot property between 2016 to 2020, redoing the building's block-wide lobby and replacing its facade with a new glass exterior. All that investment paid off, as a collection of top-tier tenants filled virtually all of the tower's space: the corporate offices of Major League Baseball, the law firm Latham & Watkins, the Japan-based bank Mizuho, and others.  Rockefeller Group, the owner of 1271 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown, Manhattan, was able to entice new tenants with a $600 million renovation. Roy Rochlin/Getty Images  But Bill Edwards, an executive vice president at Rockefeller who helps oversee its New York portfolio, said that it might have reconsidered the scale of such a thorough and costly makeover today.   We would probably have reconsidered that dollar amount given how leasing costs have increased tremendously,  Edwards said, referring to the incentives landlords award tenants to take space, including periods of free rent, rent discounts, and contributions to the costs of setting up their offices.  The fact that tenant improvement and free rent periods are much more elevated would affect the math.   At 1221 Avenue of the Americas, an almost identical-looking office tower a block away that the company also owns, Rockefeller has recently completed a more modest $50 million makeover of the building's expansive outdoor plaza along Sixth Avenue, where it has 65,000 square feet of retail space it hopes to lease to a mix of stores, fitness centers, and restaurants that will serve as a draw for tenants. It previously upgraded the plazas on the north and south sides of the tower and, in 2015, redid the lobby. About 20% of the building's leased space, totaling roughly 500,000 square feet, is set to expire beginning in 2025, meaning the tenants in those spaces could depart. For now, the company doesn't have any further work planned to lure takers.   This is a time in the market where you want to be cautious about investments and make sure you're managing the downside risks,  Edwards said.  Spiral to the deep  The financial gambit of lavishing money on upgrades has become even more challenging as cracks have formed in the financial foundations that underpin a growing number of office properties. About $80 billion of office mortgages on bank balance sheets are coming due in 2023, according to data from Trepp, and $400 billion will expire in the next 5 years, more than any other segment of the commercial real estate market.  If a property is underwater, investing in more cash can be seen as putting good money after bad  Commercial real-estate financing is generally structured differently than residential mortgages. The loans often don't amortize and include only interest payments, meaning that when they expire, usually after a period of 10 years, owners must replace them with mortgages of commensurate size. In a market where building values have fallen -- the National Council of Real Estate Investment estimated that average office values reported by its members fell 7.4% in 2022 -- and lenders have become more cautious, that swap has become increasingly difficult.  Data from Trepp suggests that at least a quarter of the roughly $68.3 billion of securitized mortgages tied to office buildings and set to expire in the next two years is too large to be fully replaced, considering the rental income of the office buildings they're tied to. The disconnect leaves owners with huge sums to pay down. If a landlord has, for instance, an expiring $100 million mortgage, but can only find $70 million of debt to replace it because of the lower value of their building and the more cautious lending standards of banks, that owner must pay the $30 million difference or risk turning the property back to its lender.   If a property is underwater, investing in more cash can be seen as putting good money after bad,  Soto said, explaining why even landlords like Brookfield, which faced a debt maturity at the Gas Company Tower in February, have chosen to default rather than pay up.  This leaves owners, their buildings, and the wider office market in a precarious position. Robert Verrone, a principal at Iron Hound, a commercial real-estate-financing firm and advisor, said he now spends the majority of his time working on ailing debts. Lenders are often reluctant, he said, to seize office buildings because of the costs and expertise required to operate the properties. In some cases, a compromise can be struck in which an owner pays back a portion of their loan in exchange for forgiveness on some of the debt by the lender. Few lenders have been in a forgiving mood so far, but that could change, Verrone said.   They're being tougher now than in 2010,  Verrone said, referring to the workouts that became commonplace in the aftermath of the great financial crisis.  But you can get a deal done if you negotiate.   Lenders with troubled loans may also resort to selling off those debts to investors who are intent on seizing properties through foreclosure. But the discounts will be steep. On a call Wednesday hosted by CBRE, Spencer Levy, a global client strategist and senior economic advisor at the company, said that it has increasingly been called on by lenders to help them value their commercial real estate loan portfolios and identify potential debts to sell.   We are currently valuing those deals in an enormously wide band,  Levy said of office loans, in particular.  50 to 90 cents on the dollar.

El caso del reportero de The Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich, esta marcado como  top secret  ya que Gershkovich no admitio su culpabilidad, informo este jueves la agencia estatal de noticias rusa TASS, citando a las fuerzas del orden.  El tribunal decidio que el periodista, como medida restrictiva, deberia ser detenido en un centro de prision preventiva, informo TASS.  El periodista fue puesto bajo arresto por un mes y veintinueve dias hasta el 29 de mayo, dijo este jueves el servicio de Prensa de la corte.  publicidad   Por decision del Tribunal de Distrito de Lefortovsky de Moscu del 30 de marzo de 2023, en relacion con E. Gershkovich, sospechoso de haber cometido un delito en virtud del articulo 276 del Codigo Penal de la Federacion de Rusia, se eligio una medida preventiva en forma de detencion por un periodo de 1 mes 29 dias, es decir, hasta el 29 de mayo de 2023 , dice el comunicado del servicio de Prensa del tribunal.  La agencia estatal de noticias TASS informo mas temprano que fue detenido en Ekaterimburgo, en el lado este de los Montes Urales.  La declaracion del Servicio Federal de Seguridad de Rusia dice:  Las actividades ilegales del corresponsal de la oficina en Moscu del periodico estadounidense The Wall Street Journal, el ciudadano estadounidense Evan Gershkovich, nacido en 1991, acreditado en el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia, sospechoso del espionaje en interes del Gobierno estadounidense, han sido suprimidas .  El comunicado del Servicio Federal de Seguridad de Rusia dice que Gershkovich fue detenido  mientras intentaba obtener informacion secreta  relacionada con  las actividades de una de las empresas del complejo militar-industrial ruso .  Segun la pagina biografica de Gershkovich en el sitio web de The Wall Street Journal, el periodista cubre Rusia, Ucrania y la ex Union Sovietica. Anteriormente trabajo para la agencia de noticias Agence France-Presse, el Moscow Times y The New York Times.  En un comunicado The Wall Street Journal dijo que  niega con vehemencia las acusaciones del Servicio Federal de Seguridad de Rusia y busca la liberacion inmediata de nuestro reportero de confianza y dedicado, Evan Gershkovich. Nos solidarizamos con Evan y su familia .  El fundador y jefe de la compania militar privada Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, dijo en una nota de voz el jueves que  no esta al tanto  del arresto del periodista de The Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich.  El mensaje surgio en respuesta a una pregunta de un periodista sobre el reportaje de Gershkovich.  En su declaracion del jueves, The Wall Street Journal no comento en que historia estaba trabajando Gershkovich en el momento de su arresto.  Entre tanto, la portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia, Maria Zakharova, dijo que el trabajo del periodista de The Wall Street Journal, Evan Gershkovich, en Ekaterimburgo, Rusia,  no tiene nada que ver con el periodismo .   Lamentablemente, no es la primera vez que la condicion de 'corresponsal en el extranjero', la visa periodistica y la acreditacion son utilizadas por extranjeros en nuestro pais para encubrir actividades que no estan relacionadas con el periodismo. Este no es el primer occidental conocido en 'aprovecharse' , dijo Zakharova en Telegram, luego del arresto del profesional bajo sospecha de espionaje.  CNN se ha puesto en contacto con la Embajada de Estados Unidos en Moscu para comentar sobre el arresto de Gershkovich.  The Wall Street Journal ha tenido una presencia establecida durante decadas en Moscu. Zakharova y el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Rusia rutinariamente hacen afirmaciones sin fundamento sobre el trabajo y los motivos de los periodistas extranjeros en Rusia.  Gershkovich, el primer periodista estadounidense arrestado en Rusia por espiar desde 1986  Evan Gershkovich es el primer periodista estadounidense acusado de espionaje por parte de Rusia desde 1986, cuando el periodista Nick Daniloff fue detenido por un cargo similar. Daniloff fue arrestado durante el final de su asignacion por trabajar para 'US News and World Report' en 1986. Fue encarcelado durante semanas en condiciones de aislamiento antes de que la gestion Reagan negociara su liberacion.  Hablando en una conferencia de prensa despues de su liberacion en 1986, Daniloff lo califico como una  situacion muy compleja , y enfatizo que sin el  interes muy profundo y personal  del presidente Reagan en su caso, probablemente habria estado encarcelado por mucho mas tiempo.   En mi caso, el FBI arresto a un sovietico en Nueva York por espionaje y luego los rusos me arrestaron a mi , dijo Daniloff a CNN. Agrego que la negociacion finalmente aseguro su liberacion, lo que implicaba una  solucion para el tipo que fue arrestado en Nueva York .  El Kremlin no hizo comentarios cuando se le pregunto si el arresto de Gershkovich fue un movimiento de ojo por ojo luego del arresto la semana anterior de Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov en Estados Unidos, acusado de ser un espia ruso.  CNN le pregunto al portavoz del Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, durante una sesion informativa diaria este jueves, si el arresto de Gershkovich podria ser una  medida de represalia  despues de que Estados Unidos arresto a un ruso por cargos de espionaje la semana pasada.

(Credito: Jonah Hinebaugh/Naples Daily News/USA Today Network)  (CNN) -- La batalla entre Disney y el gobernador de Florida, Ron DeSantis, podria no haber terminado todavia.  El nuevo consejo elegido a dedo por el gobernador republicano para supervisar el distrito fiscal especial de Disney dijo este miercoles que esta considerando emprender acciones legales contra un acuerdo de varias decadas alcanzado entre el gigante del entretenimiento y el consejo saliente en los dias previos a la adquisicion hostil por parte del estado, el mes pasado.  Segun el acuerdo -aprobado silenciosamente el 8 de febrero mientras los legisladores de Florida se reunian en sesion especial para entregar a DeSantis el control del Distrito de Mejora de Reedy Creek-, Disney mantendria el control sobre gran parte de su vasta huella en Florida Central durante 30 anos y, en algunos casos, el consejo no puede tomar medidas significativas sin obtener primero la aprobacion de la empresa.   Esto esencialmente convierte a Disney en el Gobierno , dijo Ron Peri, miembro del consejo, durante la reunion de este miercoles, segun un video publicado por una cadena de television de Orlando.  Este consejo pierde, a efectos practicos, la mayor parte de su capacidad para hacer cualquier cosa mas alla de mantener las carreteras y mantener la infraestructura basica .  Este episodio es el mas reciente giro en una saga de un ano de duracion entre Disney y DeSantis, quien ha luchado contra la empresa mientras intenta sumar victorias conservadoras antes de una probable postulacion a la candidatura presidencial del Partido Republicano en 2024.  publicidad  Este miercoles, el consejo contrato a  varias empresas financieras y juridicas para llevar a cabo auditorias e investigar el comportamiento de Disney en el pasado , dijo la portavoz de DeSantis, Taryn Fenske. De acuerdo con los documentos de la reunion, el consejo estaba entrando en acuerdos con cuatro empresas para proporcionar asesoramiento sobre el asunto.   La Oficina Ejecutiva del Gobernador esta al tanto de los ultimos esfuerzos de Disney para ejecutar contratos justo antes de ratificar la nueva ley que transfiere derechos y autoridades del antiguo Distrito de Mejoramiento de Reedy Creek a Disney , dijo Fenske.  Una revision inicial sugiere que estos acuerdos pueden tener importantes deficiencias legales que harian que los contratos fueran nulos de pleno derecho .  En una declaracion a CNN, Disney se mantuvo firme en sus acciones.   Todos los acuerdos firmados entre Disney y el Distrito fueron apropiados, y se discutieron y aprobaron en foros publicos abiertos y notificados en cumplimiento de la ley del Gobierno de Florida a la luz del sol , dijo la compania. Los documentos de la reunion del 8 de febrero muestran que se publico en el diario Orlando Sentinel, tal y como exige la ley.  Varios miembros del consejo de administracion no respondieron inmediatamente a la solicitud de comentarios. El Sentinel informo por primera vez sobre la votacion de este miercoles para contratar a un asesor juridico.  Segun un comunicado emitido este miercoles por la noche por el abogado en funciones del distrito y su recien obtenido asesor juridico, el acuerdo otorgaba a Disney derechos de desarrollo en todo el distrito y  no solo en la propiedad de Disney , exige que el distrito pida prestamos y gaste en proyectos que beneficien a la empresa, y otorga a Disney autoridad de veto sobre cualquier proyecto publico en el distrito.   La falta de consideracion, la delegacion de autoridad legislativa a una corporacion privada, la restriccion de la capacidad del Consejo para tomar decisiones legislativas y la cesion de derechos publicos sin compensacion para un fin privado, entre otras cuestiones, justifican las acciones y la direccion del nuevo Consejo para evaluar estos documentos extralimitados y determinar la mejor manera en que el nuevo Consejo puede proteger el interes publico en cumplimiento de la Ley de Florida , dice la declaracion de Fishback Dominick LLP, Cooper & Kirk PLLC, Lawson Huck Gonzalez PLLC, Waugh Grant PLLC y Nardella & Nardella PLLC.  El enfrentamiento entre Disney y el gobernador tiene su origen en la oposicion de la empresa a una ley de Florida que prohibe la ensenanza de la orientacion sexual y la identidad de genero hasta el tercer grado y solo de forma  apropiada para la edad  en los grados superiores. En marzo del ano pasado, cuando la indignacion contra la legislacion se extendio por todo el pais, Disney hizo publica una declaracion en la que prometia ayudar a que la ley fuera derogada o anulada por los tribunales.  DeSantis y los legisladores del Partido Republicano de Florida tomaron represalias eliminando el Distrito de Mejora de Reedy Creek, la autoridad fiscal especial que otorgaba a Disney el control de los terrenos dentro y alrededor de sus parques tematicos en expansion en la zona de Orlando. Pero los republicanos en el control de la legislatura estatal cambiaron de rumbo este ano y votaron en su lugar para despedir a la junta que supervisa el distrito y dio a DeSantis poder para nombrar a los cinco sustitutos. Tambien cambio el nombre de Reedy Creek por el de Distrito de Supervision del Turismo de Florida Central y elimino algunas de sus competencias.  DeSantis lleno la junta con aliados politicos, entre ellos el abogado de Tampa Martin Garcia, un prominente donante del Partido Republicano; Bridget Ziegler, la esposa del nuevo presidente del Partido Republicano de Florida; y Peri, un expastor que una vez sugirio que el agua del grifo podria estar haciendo gay a la gente.  La controversia es fundamental para la narrativa politica de DeSantis de un lider que no tiene miedo de luchar contra gigantes corporativos, incluso uno tan emblematico y vital para Florida como Disney. Es una saga que ocupa un lugar destacado en su nuevo libro y que comparte a menudo en actos por todo el pais mientras sienta las bases para una probable campana nacional.  El mes pasado, en la ceremonia de firma del proyecto de ley que le dio el control del consejo de Reedy Creek, DeSantis declaro:  El reino corporativo por fin llega a su fin .   Hay un nuevo sheriff en la ciudad , anadio.  Sin embargo, puede que pase algun tiempo antes de que la nueva estructura de poder tenga el control, si Disney se sale con la suya. Un acuerdo firmado por el consejo saliente -que restringe al nuevo consejo el uso de cualquiera de los  personajes de fantasia  de Disney- es valido hasta  21 anos despues de la muerte del ultimo superviviente de los descendientes del rey Carlos III, rey de Inglaterra , segun una copia del acuerdo incluida en el paquete de la reunion del 8 de febrero.  El sigiloso movimiento de Disney llevo a los aliados del principal rival politico de DeSantis, el expresidente Donald Trump, a sugerir que el gobernador habia sido superado.   El presidente Trump escribio El arte de la negociacion y negocio la paz en Medio Oriente , dijo Taylor Budowich, portavoz del comite de accion politica Make America Great Again, alineado con Trump.  Ron DeSantis acaba de ser superado en la negociacion por Mickey Mouse .  La operacion politica de DeSantis insistio en que los designados por el gobernador estaban responsabilizando a Disney.   El nuevo consejo del gobernador DeSantis no permitiria, y no permitira, que Disney se de a SI MISMO un poder sin precedentes sobre la tierra [!parte de la cual ni siquiera es suya!] durante mas de 30 anos , escribio en Twitter Christina Pushaw, del equipo de respuesta rapida de DeSantis."}, {"source": "cnn-es", "title": "Tiroteo en una escuela de Nashville: expertos afirman que la rapidez mental de los profesores salvo vidas", "text": "Estas armas utilizo la persona que ataco la escuela de Nashville 1:14  (CNN) -- A medida que surgen mas detalles sobre como se desarrollo un tiroteo masivo mortal dentro de una escuela cristiana privada en Nashville, un exagente de policia que proporciono entrenamiento sobre tiradores activos en la escuela dijo que las acciones rapidas de los maestros que cerraron las aulas ayudaron a salvar vidas.  La persona que entro en la Escuela Convenant este lunes disparo multiples veces contra varias aulas, pero no alcanzo a ningun alumno dentro de ellas,  porque los profesores sabian exactamente que hacer, como fortificar sus puertas y donde colocar a los ninos en esas aulas , dijo a CNN el consultor de seguridad Brink Fidler.   Su capacidad para ejecutar, literalmente, a la perfeccion bajo esa cantidad de estres, mientras que alguien trataba de asesinar a ellos y a los ninos, eso es lo que hizo la diferencia aqui , dijo Fidler.  Estos profesores son la razon por la que esos ninos volvieron a casa con sus familias , anadio.  Seis personas murieron en el tiroteo de este lunes por la manana, entre ellos, tres alumnos de 9 anos: Evelyn Dieckhaus, William Kinney y Hallie Scruggs. Los adultos muertos fueron Cynthia Peak, de 61 anos, profesora sustituta; Katherine Koonce, de 60 anos, directora de la escuela; y Mike Hill, de 61 anos, conserje, informo la Policia.  Todas las victimas que fueron alcanzadas por los disparos se encontraban en una zona abierta o en un pasillo, dijo Fidler, que recorrio la escuela con las autoridades este miercoles.  publicidad   Las unicas victimas a las que pudo alcanzar este atacante eran victimas que estaban atrapadas en algun tipo de zona abierta o pasillo , dijo Fidler.  Varias pudieron evacuar de forma segura. Las que no pudieron hacerlo de forma segura hicieron exactamente lo que se les enseno y entreno para hacer .  Aunque el agresor tenia como objetivo la escuela, se cree que las victimas fueron tiroteadas al azar, dijo la Policia.  Tambien se atribuye el merito de haber salvado vidas a los agentes que se precipitaron al interior de la escuela y dispararon mortalmente contra la persona atacante, Audrey Hale, de 28 anos, poniendo fin a los 14 minutos de terror que se desataron en la escuela.   Tuvimos oficiales heroicos que se pusieron en peligro para detener esto y podriamos haber estado hablando de mas tragedia de la que estamos , dijo Drake a CNN este miercoles.  La respuesta de las fuerzas del orden en Nashville contrasta con la respuesta en Uvalde, Texas, donde hubo un retraso de mas de una hora antes de que las autoridades se enfrentaran y mataran al agresor. El ataque en Uvalde dejo 21 muertos.  El tiroteo de este lunes en Nashville fue el mas mortifero en una escuela estadounidense desde la masacre de Uvalde en mayo pasado. Tambien supuso el decimonoveno tiroteo en una escuela o universidad en solo los ultimos tres meses que dejo al menos un herido, segun un recuento de CNN.  Un concejal de Nashville declaro tambien que un testigo le dijo que Koonce, directora de la Escuela Covenant, paso sus ultimos momentos tratando de proteger a los ninos a su cargo.   El testigo dijo que Katherine Koonce estaba en una llamada de Zoom, escucho los disparos y abruptamente termino la llamada y salio de la oficina. La suposicion a partir de ahi es que se dirigio hacia el atacante , dijo el concejal Russ Pulley. No identifico al testigo.  El jefe de la Policia metropolitana de Nashville, John Drake, dijo que no puede confirmar como murio Koonce, pero afirmo:  Se que estaba sola en el pasillo. Estoy seguro de que hubo un enfrentamiento. Se nota por la forma en que esta tirada en el pasillo .  Estos son los policias que abatieron al atacante de la escuela en Nashville 1:09  Fidler dijo que Koonce habia sido inflexible sobre la formacion del personal de la escuela sobre como responder durante una situacion de tirador activo.   Ella comprendia la gravedad del tema y la gravedad de que los profesores tuvieran que saber que hacer en esa situacion , dijo.  Koonce y las demas victimas fueron homenajeadas en una vigilia celebrada este miercoles en toda la ciudad de Nashville, donde los residentes se reunieron para rezar y llorar.   Es una tragedia que todos sentimos profundamente , dijo Eliza Hughes, residente de Nashville.  Nashville es una comunidad muy unida. Definitivamente sentimos la tragedia. Es una situacion horrible .  El FBI y la Policia rastrean los escritos y mapas del atacante  Despues del tiroteo, la Policia descubrio que Hale tenia mapas detallados de la Escuela Covenant --a la que habia asistido-- y  bastantes  escritos relacionados con el tiroteo, segun el jefe de Policia.  El FBI, la Oficina de Investigacion de Tennessee y la Policia examinaron los mapas y escritos que Hale dejo, incluido un cuaderno de notas, dijo Drake.  Las autoridades calificaron el ataque de  calculado , y Drake dijo este miercoles que los mapas  mostraban la entrada a la escuela, una ruta que se tomaria para lo que se fuera a llevar a cabo .  Tambien se cree que el atacante tenia entrenamiento con armas y habia llegado a la escuela fuertemente armado y preparado para un enfrentamiento con las fuerzas del orden, dijo la Policia.  Pero a medida que se conocen los detalles de la planificacion previa, sigue sin estar claro que motivo el ataque. Drake dijo que la Policia se reunio con la escuela y no encontro indicios de que Hale tuviera problemas mientras asistia al establecimiento.  Hale habia estado bajo cuidado por un trastorno emocional y compro legalmente siete armas en los ultimos tres anos, pero se mantuvieron ocultas a los padres de Hale, dijo Drake. Tres de las armas, incluido un rifle AR-15, se utilizaron en el ataque de este lunes.  Tennessee no tiene una ley de  alerta temprana  que permitiria a un juez confiscar temporalmente las armas de alguien que se cree que es una amenaza para si mismo o para otros.  El jefe de Policia dijo que no se habia contactado previamente con las fuerzas del orden en relacion con el tirador, y que Hale nunca fue internado en una institucion.  La amiga de la infancia de Hale, Averianna Patton, dijo a CNN el martes que la persona que perpetro el ataque le envio mensajes inquietantes minutos antes del hecho, diciendo  estoy planeando morir hoy  y que saldria en las noticias.  Patton llamo a la Oficina del Sheriff del condado de Davidson, en Nashville, pero estuvo en espera durante  unos 7 minutos , dijo. Para entonces, el tiroteo ya habia comenzado.  Consultado por los mensajes, Drake declaro a CNN:  Si la cronologia es correcta, la llamada se recibio cuando el agente ya habia llegado al lugar de los hechos. Asi que no tiene nada que ver .   En el momento en que recibimos la llamada, respondimos inmediatamente a la escena. Los agentes se detuvieron, estaban recibiendo disparos, sacaron el arma, entraron, no esperaron , dijo Drake.  El atacante entro en la escuela disparando contra las puertas de cristal y trepando por ellas para acceder al interior, segun muestra el video de vigilancia. La primera llamada sobre el tiroteo se recibio a las 10.13 horas, y la Policia llego al lugar a las 10.24 horas, segun el jefe de Policia.  Las grabaciones de las camaras corporales de los primeros agentes que acudieron al lugar de los hechos muestran como se apresuran a entrar y desalojan las aulas antes de correr hacia el segundo piso de la escuela, donde un agente armado con un fusil de asalto dispara varias veces al agresor, que murio a las 10.27 horas, segun la Policia.  La Policia se ha referido a Hale como una  mujer , y mas tarde dijo que Hale era transgenero. Hale utilizaba pronombres masculinos en un perfil de las redes sociales, dijo un portavoz a CNN cuando se le pidio que lo aclarara.  Nuestro corazon esta roto  Los residentes de Nashville se reunieron este miercoles en una vigilia por toda la ciudad para llorar a las victimas, rezar y compartir el dolor.  La primera dama, Jill Biden, asistio al acto, al igual que la cantautora Sheryl Crow, que interpreto su cancion  I Shall Believe  ante la afligida multitud.   Nashville ha sufrido hoy lo peor , dijo el alcalde John Cooper a la multitud.  Nuestro corazon esta roto. Nuestra ciudad unida mientras lloramos juntos .  El jefe de Policia tambien se dirigio a la comunidad, diciendo que un tiroteo escolar como el que los oficiales enfrentaron en la Escuela Covenant este lunes es un momento para el que los agentes se han entrenado pero esperaban que nunca llegara.   Nuestros policias han llorado y lloran con Nashville y con el mundo , dijo Drake.  Mientras la comunidad llora, las familias lloran la perdida de sus seres queridos en el tiroteo.  William, uno de los ninos asesinados, tenia un  espiritu imperturbable , compartieron amigos de la familia Kinney en GoFundMe.  La tia de Hallie, Kara Arnold, dijo que la nina de 9 anos tenia  un amor por la vida que la mantenia sonriendo y corriendo y saltando y jugando y siempre en movimiento .  La familia de Evelyn la llamo  una luz brillante en este mundo .  La familia de Hill, padre de siete hijos y abuelo de 14, recordo su amor por la cocina y por pasar tiempo con su familia.

Promotions are subject to availability and retailer terms.  Whether or not your life insurance policy is taxable depends on the situation. /Getty Images  Life insurance is a valuable part of many people's financial plans. It helps take care of your loved ones after you die, can provide an inheritance for your heirs and it may even provide cash during your lifetime, depending on the policy type. For these reasons, life insurance could be worth it for you, whether you're young or old.  But, as with many financial products, there are tax considerations to keep in mind. In this article, we go over when life insurance is (and is not) taxable.  Get a free life insurance estimate now to begin exploring your options.  Is life insurance taxable?  The short answer is: It depends. Here are the situations when you may need to consider taxes on your life insurance policy.  Payouts to beneficiaries  If your beneficiaries opt to receive the death benefit as a lump-sum payout, they won't have to pay taxes on it. If they choose to receive payments over several years (known as an annuity), they may earn interest on those payments, which the IRS considers taxable income.   Generally, life insurance proceeds you receive as a beneficiary due to the death of the insured person, aren't includable in gross income and you don't have to report them,  the IRS says.  However, any interest you receive is taxable and you should report it as interest received.   Start your policy search by getting a free life insurance quote here.  Cash value  Whole life insurance policies build cash value, which you can use while you're alive. If you access this cash value and it's more than the premium payments you've made so far, the difference may be taxable. Term life insurance does not build cash value, so this situation does not apply to those policies.  Surrendering your policy  If you decide you no longer need (or want) your life insurance policy, you can surrender it to your insurance provider for cash. If the amount you receive is more than the premium payments you've made so far, the difference may be taxable.  Selling your policy  You can also sell your policy to a third party in a process known as a life settlement. It can be complicated, and it's often wiser to reduce your coverage or surrender your policy. But if you choose to go this route, the tax consequences are the same as they are for accessing cash value or surrendering. If the proceeds exceed the premium payments you've made to date, the difference may be taxable.  Estate taxes  If your estate is worth more than the estate tax exemption, the IRS counts your life insurance proceeds toward your total estate value. That means your heirs must pay estate tax on any amount over the exemption. For the tax year 2023, this exemption is $12.92 million for individuals and $25.84 million for married couples filing jointly.  You can avoid estate tax by creating an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) and using that trust to pay your policy's premiums. This keeps your policy proceeds from being counted in your estate value.  Request a free estimate now to see how much life insurance coverage you can get.  Gift tax  Typically, there are two parties in a life insurance policy: the person who buys the policy for themselves and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries). However, sometimes, someone buys a policy for another person, which adds a third party to the equation. If this is the case, the IRS classifies the death benefit as a gift, which means it may be subject to taxation.  As with estate taxes, gift tax only applies if your estate value exceeds $12.92 million for individuals or $25.84 million for married couples filing jointly.  The bottom line  To determine how taxes might affect your life insurance, consult with a tax professional. Whether or not your policy results in taxes, there are many reasons why it's still worth having. Make sure you're getting the most out of your policy by requesting offers from the best life insurance companies and comparing them with your needs and goals."}, {"source": "cbs-news", "title": "U.S. sanctions man for trying to arrange arms deal between Russia and North Korea", "text": "Washington -- The Biden administration has sanctioned a Slovakian man who U.S. officials said attempted to facilitate an arms deal that would have given Russia access to weapons and munitions from North Korea in exchange for aircraft, food and other material.  The Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting Ashot Mkrtychev, the man accused of trying to arrange the secret deal. Officials said the episode is the latest sign that Russia is searching for ways to replenish its military capabilities as it continues to suffer losses amid heavy fighting in Ukraine.   We know that between the end of 2022 and early 2023, that [Mkrtychev] worked with North Korean officials to attempt to obtain, as I said, over two dozen kinds of weapons and ammunitions for Russia  in exchange for aircraft, raw materials and commodities, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters on a call.

The Treasury Department said Mkrtychev  confirmed Russia's readiness to receive military equipment from the DPRK with senior Russian officials,  using North Korea's official diplomatic name. The department said Mkrtychev worked with a Russian official to locate commercial aircraft that could be delivered to North Korea. Thursday's sanctions mean all of Mkrtychev's property and interests in the U.S. or in the possession of U.S. persons are blocked.   Russia has lost over 9,000 pieces of heavy military equipment since the start of the war, and thanks in part to multilateral sanctions and export controls, Putin has become increasingly desperate to replace them,  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.  Schemes like the arms deal pursued by this individual show that Putin is turning to suppliers of last resort like Iran and the DPRK. We remain committed to degrading Russia's military-industrial capabilities, as well as exposing and countering Russian attempts to evade sanctions and obtain military equipment from the DPRK or any other state that is prepared to support its war in Ukraine.   Mkrtychev joins the growing list of individuals and entities the U.S. has sanctioned since Russia invaded Ukraine more than a year ago. The U.S. and its allies announced a new round of sanctions last month targeting more than 200 people and entities, including both Russians and third-country actors.  U.S. officials have previously issued public warnings that Russia is seeking to replenish its military stockpiles through deals with other countries as it struggles to replace weapons, shells and ammunition. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last month that China was considering providing  lethal support  to Russia, and Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week.  Xi made no promises to provide weapons to Russia and China officially it considers itself an  impartial  observer to the conflict, but the two leaders issued a statement saying it was necessary to  respect legitimate security concerns of all countries,  an apparent swipe at the West."}, {"source": "cbs-news", "title": "Vatican spokesperson says Pope Francis's health is  progressively improving ", "text": "Vatican spokesperson says Pope Francis's health is  progressively improving  CBS News foreign correspondent Chris Livesay joins Errol Barnett and Lana Zak from Rome to discuss the latest we know about the Pope after he was hospitalized Wednesday with a respiratory infection."}, {"source": "cbs-news", "title": "Russia arrests Wall Street Journal reporter and accuses him of espionage", "text": "Russia arrests Wall Street Journal reporter and accuses him of espionage Russian authorities say they've arrested Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, accusing him of espionage.

At the Capitol, protestors lined the hallways and chanted at the state's Republican-dominated Legislature as they filed in to begin taking up bills for the first time since the shooting.  Chants of  Save our children!  echoed noisily in the hallways between the state Senate and House chambers, with protesters setting up shop inside and outside the Capitol. Some silently filled the Senate chamber's gallery, including children who held signs reading  I'm nine  -- a reference to the age of the three kids who died in Monday's attack. Most protesters were removed from the gallery after some began yelling down at the lawmakers,  Children are dead!   Meanwhile, in the House, two Democratic lawmakers caused a temporary shutdown when they began yelling,  Power to the people  through a megaphone.  Firearms recently became the number one cause of death for children and teens in the United States, surpassing motor vehicle deaths and those caused by other injuries, according to an analysis by KFF, a not-for-profit providing health policy analysis and journalism.  Since the Columbine High School Massacre in 1999, 175 people have died in 15 mass shootings events connected to U.S. schools and colleges, according to a database compiled by The Associated Press, USA Today and Northeastern University.

Protesters gather inside the Tennessee State Capitol to call for an end to gun violence and support stronger gun laws in Nashville, Tennessee. Seth Herald via Getty Images  In Washington D.C., Republicans showed little appetite to pass more gun restrictions. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican who represents the Knoxville area, said Congress isn't going to fix the problems that led to Monday's shooting.  The protests followed a Wednesday night candlelight vigil in Nashville where Republican lawmakers stood alongside first lady Jill Biden, Democratic lawmakers and musicians including Sheryl Crow, who has called for stricter gun controls since the attack.  The vigil was somber and at times tearful, as speaker after speaker read the victims' names and offered condolences to their loved ones but refrained from any statement that could be seen as political. The family of Mike Hill, a 61-year-old custodian who was among those killed, was in attendance, including his seven children.   Just two days ago was our city's worst day,  Mayor John Cooper said.  I so wish we weren't here, but we need to be here.   In attendance was Shaundelle Brooks, whose 23-year-old son, Akilah Dasilva, was among the four people killed in a 2018 shooting at a Nashville Waffle House. Brooks said she went to the vigil to support the families of those killed at the school.   I know what it's like to be a parent - what it feels like, like you're drowning and can't move, and that weakness and that hole that comes in your stomach,  she said.  Police have said a 28-year-old former student, whom they identified as Audrey Hale, drove up to the school on Monday morning, shot out the glass doors, entered and began firing indiscriminately. Police later fatally shot Hale.  In addition to Hill, the victims were identified as three 9-year-old students, Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney; Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school; and substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61.

Jamaal Bowman, a Democrat from New York, and Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, had an intense exchange in the hallways of the Capitol on gun control Wednesday evening, two days after the deadly shooting at a school in Tennessee.  The confrontation started in a hallway outside the House chamber, where Bowman, a former educator and middle school principal from the Bronx, launched into a fiery tirade.  They're cowards, they're all cowards. They won't do anything to save the lives of our children at all,  Bowman said, referring to Republican lawmakers.   Cowards! Pressure them, force them to respond to the question, why the hell won't you do anything to save America's children? And let them explain that all the way up until Election Day on 2024,  Bowman said to a group of reporters.  Let them explain it all the way up to Election Day on 2024. They're freaking cowards, they're gutless.   Massie approached Bowman and asked what he was referring to, and Bowman said  gun violence.  On Monday, three children and three adults were killed in a shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. Police said the shooter had three guns at the school, and had legally purchased seven guns in the past year.  In 2022, Congress passed a bipartisan bill that enhanced background checks for gun buyers under 21 and added funding for mental health services and school security. The bill quickly signed by President Biden. Democrats have since pushed to renew a federal ban on assault weapons, which expired in 2015, but their efforts have been thwarted by Republicans, who have called for more school safety measures.  Massie told Bowman,  You know, there's never been a school shooting in a school that allows teachers to carry.    Carry guns? You think -- more guns lead to more death! More guns lead to more death,  Bowman responded.  Massie started to ask Bowman if he would cosponsor his bill, but the New York Democrat interrupted.   Look at the data,  Bowman said.  You're not looking at any data. You're carrying the water for the gun lobby. Look at the data. More guns lead to more deaths. States that have open carry laws have more deaths. States that have open carry laws have more deaths.   Massie tried to repeat that there had never been a school shooting in a school where the teachers were armed, but Bowman asked if Massie was listening to what he was saying. Massie then told Bowman to calm down.   Calm down? Children are dying!  Bowman said.  Massie said,  I know, I've got...  before Bowman interjected again.   Nine year old children!  Bowman said.  The solution is not arming more teachers. Have you ever worked in a school? Have you ever worked in a school? Have you ever worked in a school? Have you ever worked in a school? That's a yes or no question. Have you ever worked in a school? You have not answered my question. Don't stop and talk to me.   On Tuesday, first lady Jill Biden stopped by a candlelit vigil in Nashville to honor the victims of the shooting, the first representative from the White House to visit the city since the shooting.   As you heard the president say throughout this week, we continue to call on Congress to act to pass an assault weapons ban, and take additional actions to make our kids and communities safer,  White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at Wednesday's press briefing.

(1:08)  Justin Verlander talks about being placed on IL to start Mets career (1:08)  The New York Mets placed right-hander Justin Verlander on the injured list with a low-grade muscle strain near his pitching shoulder, the team announced on Thursday.  The injury is to Verlander's teres major (a muscle that connects the scapula to the upper arm) and he will continue to throw at  moderate intensity  with a reevaluation scheduled for next week.  The injury popped up following a bullpen session Wednesday after Verlander's velocity fell in his final spring training start. The team did not hint there was any injury until the announcement on Thursday.   This isn't best-case scenario,  Verlander told the media in Miami.  But I would think this is probably second-best case. Very minimal.   The reigning American League Cy Young Award winner was scheduled to pitch Saturday against the Miami Marlins, which would have been his regular-season Mets debut after signing a two-year, $86.66 million deal this offseason.  New York has faced a lot of injuries before Opening Day, with Edwin Diaz out for the season after hurting his knee celebrating at the World Baseball Classic and the team currently without starter Jose Quintana and reliever Sam Coonrod.  Verlander, 40, expressed confidence that the injury was minor, adding that he would pitch through an injury like this during the postseason. The righty previously missed the entire 2021 season due to Tommy John surgery before putting together one of the best seasons of his career in 2022, finishing 18-4 and posting a 1.75 ERA in 175 innings for the Houston Astros en route to his third Cy Young award.  The Mets signed Verlander after losing ace Jacob deGrom in free agency to the Texas Rangers."}, {"source": "espn", "title": "Aaron Judge picks up where he left off, homers in 1st at-bat", "text": "NEW YORK -- New York Yankees fans did not have to wait long for the team's first win of the season or for reigning American League MVP Aaron Judge's first home run of 2023.  In the first inning on Opening Day, Judge saw a 93 mph sinker from San Francisco Giants ace Logan Webb and deposited it 422 feet over the Yankee Stadium center-field wall for his first home run of season, and the first one leaguewide in 2023, in his first at-bat as the Yankees' captain.  Judge later added a single as the Yankees rolled to a 5-0 victory.   That's about as tough a guy as you're going to do it against, right on right, Webb is going to keep you in the ballpark,  New York manager Aaron Boone said of Judge's home run.  To get a ball up like that, and to hit it out on a cold day, dead center, not only is it is a difficult chore in and of itself. But to get us a shot right there in the first and kind of let Gerrit [Cole] take it from there ... to set the tone for us like that, especially after the offseason, signing back and [being named] captain, for him to get us rolling was very fitting.   Before taking the field Thursday, Judge had joked about Major League Baseball scheduling a Giants-Yankees Opening Day matchup for the first time ever, putting him up against the team that he rooted for growing up in Northern California and that also pursued him in free agency as much as the Yankees did.   I don't know who at MLB did that to me,  Judge said with a smile,  but it's going to be a fun afternoon, that's for sure, getting a chance to play the team I watched a lot as a kid.   Judge, who negotiated with San Francisco in the offseason before signing a nine-year, $360 million deal to remain with the Yankees, called his meetings with the club  a dream come true  but said he was certain he made the right decision in returning to New York.   I didn't want to go anywhere,  Judge reiterated after Thursday's win.  I was pretty vocal about that from the beginning. This is where I wanted be.   Boone said before the game that one of his  lowest, darkest places  in the winter was the period of time he thought that Judge would sign with San Francisco, having to picture him on the third-base line in a Giants uniform on Opening Day.  It was an entirely different script Thursday night.   That's pretty good,  Boone said after the victory.  When your ace goes out there and punches 11 in six innings and the bullpen ... everyone had a hand in it. We were able to add on a couple of insurance with some good, quality at-bats. Caught the ball on defense. Just crisp, which you like to see on Opening Day. I thought we looked like a settled team out there, and that was good to see.   In 2022, Judge was voted AL MVP after threatening for the Triple Crown, finishing first in home runs (62) and RBIs (131) and second in batting average (.311), recording an inordinate 1.111 OPS and breaking Roger Maris' 61-year-old AL home run mark.  Before the game, Judge made sure to shift focus on any expectations of another 60-homer season. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, the last player with even back-to-back 45-homer seasons was Ryan Howard, who surpassed that total in four straight years from 2006 to 2009.   I know very few followed up with 60. A couple I know hit 50 after that. But we'll see what happens,  Judge said.  Maybe we can make a new list. We'll see.   That list has now begun with home run No. 1, a blast that Yankees ace Gerrit Cole called a  tone-setter  in the game.  Gleyber Torres, who gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead in the fourth inning with a two-run shot of his own, said Judge's homer was far from unexpected.  I'm not surprised,  the Yankees' designated hitter said, beaming.   Getting a chance to get one run on the board there early for Cole, I think it was huge,  Judge explained.  It allowed him to settle in and work with a little bit of a lead; the next one [by Torres] gave him a nice cushion to really execute his plan and try to attack the Giants. I think it was huge getting that run there in the first and then letting Cole go out there and do his thing.   Judge added:  Anytime you come away with the win Opening Day, and kind of get things rolling, makes for a pretty special Opening Day.   Aaron Judge's first swing of 2023 -- and first as the Yankees' captain -- went out of the park for a home run. Brad Penner/USA Today Sports  Cole also had a banner 2023 debut on his fourth Opening Day start in pinstripes, striking out 11 Giants through six innings to set a franchise record previously held by Tim Leary (9 strikeouts, 1991). Webb also set a Giants Opening Day record when he recorded his 12th strikeout in the sixth inning.   I thought his fastball and his ability to move it around, in, out, up, down, was really strong, coupled with having a presence with the changeup against the lefties,  Boone said of Cole's outing.  Threw some really good sliders where he got some strikeouts. Just a really good performance, especially after struggling with the first hitter, kind of found his way and was pretty electric from there.   The game not only marked the start of Judge's captaincy in New York, it also featured the major league debut of 21-year-old rookie Anthony Volpe at shortstop. Volpe referred to Opening Day as  probably the most fun day of my entire life  and said he had  goosebumps the whole day.   Volpe, who went 0-for-2 with a walk and a stolen base, gave the Yankees faithful a big moment to cheer when he kissed the NYY logo on his jersey while his name was chanted for the first time by Yankee Stadium's rowdy right-field fan collective commonly known as the  Bleacher Creatures.   Volpe explained that kissing the logo was an homage to Judge, who had done so in 2022, which was met with a seal of approval by the Yankees' captain. Judge also had high praise for Volpe's poise, with the hefty expectations of being the youngest Yankees starting shortstop since Derek Jeter made his debut at age 20 in 1995.   I was kind of ragging him a little bit,  Judge said of teasing Volpe ahead of Opening Day.  I said, 'Man you know, I know you're a big Yankee fan, you gotta have something special for the bleacher creatures. You're the shortstop of the New York Yankees, you got to have something ...' I think the fans got a pretty good roar. And I know he did not get the hits he wanted, but those will come.   After their Opening Day victory over the Giants, the Yankees announced they acquired right-handed pitcher Colten Brewer from the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for cash considerations.  Brewer, 30, spent the majority of the 2022 season in the minor leagues with the Kansas City Royals, recording a 4.76 ERA over 36 relief appearances before being released in August. Brewer had been a 2023 spring training invitee with the Rays and did not allow an earned run over eight relief appearances.  Boone had announced earlier Thursday that the Yankees had  a potential deal going  and that  a pitcher could be play  before the announcement. Acquiring Brewer was actually the 12th roster move announced by the Yankees on a busy Thursday, which also included placing fellow right-handed relievers Lou Trivino (elbow strain) and Tommy Kahnle (biceps tendinitis) on the 15-day injured list.  The Yankees also announced they recalled minor league pitcher Jhony Brito from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Brito will be the starter Sunday for the series finale against the Giants, with the Yankees missing three-fifths of their anticipated 2023 starter rotation, with Luis Severino (low-grade lat strain), Carlos Rodon (forearm) and Frankie Montas (shoulder surgery) all on the injured list."}, {"source": "espn", "title": "Indiana's Teri Moren wins AP Coach of the Year", "text": "Alyssa Geary dimes Sydney Parrish for an impressive basket, then Yarden Garzon knocks down the 3-pointer to extend the Hoosiers' lead.

Moren was honored Thursday as the AP women's basketball Coach of the Year, the first time she has won the award.

Utah's Lynne Roberts received five and Virginia Tech's Kenny Brooks three.  Voting was done before the NCAA tournament.   I think a lot of people were like, 'This is going to be a year where Indiana is reloading, rebuilding, they won't be as good as they had been the year prior.' We were picked third in the Big Ten,  Moren said.  Moren was surprised by her players, who told her she won in an elaborate ruse.   Anytime you can share it with people that made it happen, the staff, the players, the most important people who have been instrumental in the season and this award is special. I was speechless.   Moren accepted the award at the Final Four, sharing the stage with AP Player of the Year Caitlin Clark to complete a Big Ten sweep.  The team has come a long way from when Moren was a young girl growing up in southern Indiana. She was a diehard fan of the Indiana basketball team. The men's one, that is.  She would attend men's games with her family when she was a kid and was a big fan of coach Bob Knight. She has a constant reminder of the Hall of Fame coach in her office as a picture of his infamous chair-throwing incident hangs by the door. Moren said it's the last thing she sees before heading to practice.  As far as the women's team, they just weren't very good in the old days. Times have changed, as Moren has built the program into a blue-collar team that focuses on defense and has consistently ranked in the Top 25 the past few seasons, appearing in the poll for 75 consecutive weeks starting with the preseason one in 2019-2020. That's the fourth-longest active streak.  Before that, the Hoosiers had been ranked a total of six times.   People still talk to me about living in Bloomington and they couldn't afford a ticket to the men's game. Not that they settled, but became women's basketball fans. At that moment, you could walk in and find any seat you wanted and watch women's basketball,  Moren said.   There were 300-400 people in the stands, now to what it is today, it's an unbelievable thing to watch it grow. Things you dream about to see fans and bodies up in the rafters.   The Hoosiers had six of the school's 10 most attended games this season, including crowds of over 13,000 fans for the first round of the NCAA tournament and 14,000 for the second-round game -- a shocking loss to Miami.   It stings right now, but that last game doesn't define our season,  Moren said."}, {"source": "espn", "title": "John Mara jokingly warns Brian Daboll - Don't go 'from Bono to Bozo'", "text": "Giants owner John Mara warns head coach Brian Daboll not to go  from Bono to Bozo  in response to his successful first season.

Daboll's rock star status in the Big Apple has not gone unnoticed by team owner John Mara, who said during a recent interview that he jokingly offered a lighthearted warning to his head coach.   We kid him,  Mara told SiriusXM NFL Radio.  I mean, right now he's Bono walking around New York City.   But I've told him -- I've said: 'In this business, it doesn't take long to go from Bono to Bozo. So don't get your head too big right now.' But he has been great.   In his first season as an NFL head coach, Daboll inherited a rebuilding Giants team that had posted five consecutive seasons with double-digit losses and finished last in the NFC East three times over that span.  Despite low expectations, the Giants went 9-7-1 under Daboll and reached the playoffs for the first time since 2016, upsetting the Vikings in the wild-card round before being eliminated by the Eagles the following weekend.  Daboll, a longtime assistant at the NFL and college level, was named the NFL Coach of the Year by both The Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers Association of America.   He likes to go to Rangers games at the Garden, and they put his picture up there and he gets these standing ovations week after week,  Mara said during the interview.  So it's a pretty cool thing to see.   Daboll said earlier this week at the NFL owners meetings in Arizona that the Giants still have a  long climb  in 2023 and beyond to catch the Eagles, the reigning NFC champions who won all three meetings between the division rivals last season.   What you do one year has no correlation to what you do next year,  he told reporters Tuesday.  What you do one game has no correlation to what you do the next game. ...

I'm there for inspiring the next generation and being there for the people that you know are going through a hard time,  said Clark, who grew up in Iowa.  Being able to give joy to people that watch you play and watch your team play is amazing.

She averaged 27.0 points, 8.3 assists and 7.5 rebounds during the season to help Iowa go 26-6. Clark has 984 points, the sixth-most in a season by any player in Division I women's history. She also has over 300 assists.   She is spectacular. I don't know how else to describe what she does on the basketball court,  Bluder said.  Next up for the Hawkeyes is undefeated South Carolina in the national semifinals. The Gamecocks are led by Aliyah Boston, last season's winner of the award.

I think that's really good for our game when there's a lot of great players. That's what is going to help this game grow more than anything else.   Whether it's hitting deep 3s from the Hawkeyes' logo at home games, hitting off-balance game-winning shots or throwing pinpoint passes to teammates for easy baskets, Clark has excelled on the court this year to get Iowa to a place it hasn't been in a long time.   It's funny, because the better the opponent, almost the better she plays,  Bluder said.  It's like she locks in on those, when we're playing against Top 25 teams. That's when her statistics even go up even more, against great opponents.   Clark is the second Iowa player to win the AP award in the past few seasons, joining Megan Gustafson, who won it in 2019.  The Wade Trophy, named after former Delta State coach Margaret Wade, is the oldest player of the year award in women's basketball; it was first given in 1978. Clark also won the Naismith Award this week.  The WBCA All-America team dates back to 1975. The other members of that team are Boston, LSU's Angel Reese and Virginia's Tech's Elizabeth Kitley -- who like Clark are all playing in the Final Four -- along with Stanford's Cameron Brink, Indiana's Mackenzie Holmes, Iowa State's Ashley Joens, Maryland's Diamond Miller, Utah's Alissa Pili and Villanova's Maddy Siegrist.  The Wooden Award All-Americans are Clark, Boston, Brink, Holmes and Siegrist. The winner of the Wooden Award will be announced Monday.

(2:07)  EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- A new playing surface has been installed at MetLife Stadium, where the previous turf had become an object of widespread criticism in recent years.  While not grass, the new surface is believed to be an improved synthetic turf that will decrease the number of injuries that occur at the home of the New York Giants and New York Jets.  The two New York teams will now play on an updated version of FieldTurf -- a recent edition called FieldTurf Core system, which is the first multilayer dual-polymer monofilament fiber.  The heavyweight infill design claims to deliver a lower incidence of total injuries compared to various infill weights. The performance and durability of the surface are backed by multiple independent certified sources and was tested to 200,000 cycles on the fiber wear test by Penn State's Center for Sports Surface Research.  Giants owner John Mara confirmed to reporters this week that the new turf was installed at the stadium and the team practice facility across the parking lot in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Mara also said he hoped that the stadium eventually will convert to either a grass or hybrid field.  The sticking point with grass has long been its ability to hold up under the Northeast climate and heavy usage of MetLife Stadium. Several Giants players publicly expressed their desire to change to natural grass, including former team captain Julian Love, who said  the stats have shown we are on one of the worst fields in the league.   In the meantime, FieldTurf Core was considered the best option at this time.   Installation of the new FieldTurf CORE system reinforces the commitment we have to providing the best playing surface for our teams,  president and CEO of MetLife Stadium Ron VanDeVeen said Thursday in a statement.  The research that FieldTurf has put into the heavyweight infill design for this new field system will equip MetLife Stadium with one of the premier surfaces in the league.   The previous turf at MetLife Stadium has been the subject of multiple complaints in the past, including by the San Francisco 49ers after five players suffered lower-body injuries in the same game against the Jets during the 2020 season. The knee injuries suffered by Nick Bosa and Solomon Thomas were season-ending.  Last season, the Baltimore Ravens were unhappy after cornerback Kyle Fuller tore an ACL at MetLife in a Week 1 game against the Jets.   Everybody in this league should do everything they can to put the best surface out there,  Ravens coach John Harbaugh said after that game.  How much is invested in the players who go out there and play, and our league really is a player-driven league, and we want those guys to have the best of the best, especially surfaces to play on. ... That turf was matted down, it was packed down, it was a little tight.   The NFL's recent rate of noncontact injuries to the knee, ankle and foot is roughly the same on natural and artificial playing surfaces, according to internal data reviewed by ESPN last year.  Those numbers contradict anecdotal observations from this past season from a wide swath of players, agents and coaches who have called for the league to convert all surfaces to grass in response to a series of high-profile injuries on artificial turf."}, {"source": "espn", "title": "Stephen Curry signs new long-term Under Armour agreement", "text": "Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry has signed a new long-term extension with Under Armour that will extend beyond his playing days and into his retirement.  Although exact terms were not disclosed, the new agreement could be one of the richest-ever endorsement deals in sports once annual base pay, stock equity, royalties on signature products and on-court incentive bonuses are tallied.  Curry, who first signed with Under Armour in 2013 and launched the Curry Brand in 2020, will have the title of president of Curry Brand and will receive additional resources to grow his namesake brand.   We started with the signature business, and with the opportunity to deepen the partnership, with an expectation of it going past my playing days and the added investment in the great things that we both bring to the table, it's an exciting time to strengthen that partnership,  said Curry, who is on his 10th signature sneaker with Under Armour.  We understand that it's a mutually beneficial venture to do some great things, build a great roster, build more scale to the business and create great storytelling.   Stephen Curry signed his new Under Armour endorsement contract alongside company founder Kevin Plank before last week's win over the Mavericks. Courtesy Under Armour  The growth potential of the stock awarded and expected annual compensation could see Curry earn more from the Under Armour extension than from his NBA contracts, which will total more than $473 million through the 2025-26 season.   There's always been a continuation [in mind] with Stephen,  Under Armour founder Kevin Plank said.  I couldn't imagine Under Armour without Stephen, or Stephen without Under Armour.   Plank said that specified performance-based revenue targets would trigger clauses to continually extend Curry's contract, saying it has the potential to be a lifetime deal.  Phil de Picciotto, the Octagon agency president and founder who negotiated on behalf of Curry, framed the structure as a  really comprehensive deal  that is  meant to stand the ages.    Belief is a big part of who I am on and off the court,  Curry said.  I believe in Under Armour and Curry Brand, the team now in place, and what we're doing together. We share a vision for a big future ahead.   Said Plank:  Why equity was such an important part of this is that Curry Brand and Under Armour are meant to help each other equally throughout this. We're going to build a kick-ass, long-term, foundational brand with Curry.   Negotiations toward an extension began over a year ago, well ahead of the 2024 expiration of Curry's previous deal. To sign the finalized contract, Plank and Curry met in person last week in Dallas, ahead of the Warriors' road win over the Mavericks.   The fact that KP has led the charge from his mom's basement [in 1996] to what Under Armour is today, and there's a reinvigorated energy around what we can do together, it was important to have that shaking-of-the-hands moment,  Curry said.  Said Plank:  It begins with the person. One of the best things about Stephen that makes this deal so easy is that he truly is a better person than he is a basketball player. And man, he's the best in the world at one of those, so that's a pretty big statement.   This season, Curry became the ninth player in league history to have a signature sneaker series reach a 10th consecutive model. Of the NBA's 22 current signature shoe lines, the Curry series is one of the top five highest-grossing signature businesses annually.   I took a chance on trying to partner with them,  Curry said.  It sounds crazy, but in 2013 they were still an up-and-coming threat to the sportswear industry and building the basketball category. We've been attached at the hip ever since. The good, the bad and the learning lessons of all of it are part of trying to do great things in business.   Stephen Curry entered a select company this season with the launch of his 10th signature shoe. Noah Graham/NBAE via Getty Images  With Curry's new deal set to extend beyond his playing career, there will also be a focus on signing athletes as Curry Brand endorsers. More than a year ago, Curry's SC30 Inc. company signed UConn women's basketball star Azzi Fudd to an NIL deal. The agreement designated her as a Curry Brand ambassador and provides the 20-year-old with on- and off-court mentorship from Curry.   I do have a lot left to accomplish on the court, however long I am playing. Hopefully, it's no time soon that I'm thinking about calling it quits,  said Curry, who turned 35 earlier this month.  We're going to have an investment in the roster of athletes -- men and women, from various sports -- that want to be a part of the UA and Curry Brand family. That's where I think the biggest growth can come.   After more than a year of poring over the contract's nuances and clauses, the two sides are looking forward to the future for Under Armour and Curry Brand together.   We had 10 great years and it taught us a lot, but we are truly just getting started,  Plank said.  We have yet to play our best game with Curry Brand, and what people are going to expect to see from a product standpoint, from a story standpoint and from an inspiration standpoint, we're going to build something awesome.   Said Curry:  A lot of work goes into what we do daily and thinking about how we can make it even bigger and broader. I'm just proud that we've gotten to this point. Now, the real work begins. "}, {"source": "espn", "title": "2023 NFL free agency: Seven teams with roster holes, what's next", "text": "With the bulk of NFL free agency spending in the books, I want to take a step back and look at the teams that were left with vacancies to fill in the months to come. We understandably spend March focusing on the players who sign deals (or who hint at the possibility of a trade for weeks on end with no conclusion), but we often don't look closer at what's left behind by the departures of those players.  Let's examine each position, pick a team that has lost a key player (or players) without fully replacing them and identify what their most likely path to plugging those holes looks like over the next few months. I'll be using each team's history and the various options available to them to guide me.  Most teams like to have their quarterback plans locked in before the new league year begins, let alone by the end of March. Looking around the league, nearly every team either has a starter in place or a clear path to their next starter in April's draft. There's one conspicuous exception to that list and there's an eminently reasonable solution still on the market. Let's start there:  Jump to a team with a hole:  Cardinals | Cowboys  Eagles | Packers  Rams | Ravens | Titans  Out: Lamar Jackson  Jackson's future with the organization is subject to all kinds of possibilities, many of which I covered in my piece on him earlier this month. Jackson has requested a trade, but the most likely scenario would see him return to the Ravens. At the moment, despite being stuck with the franchise tag, he isn't a member of the organization until he either signs the tag or inks a long-term deal. If he doesn't do either of those things and doesn't find an offer sheet on the market to his liking, he wouldn't be eligible to play in 2023.  Baltimore's first player up would be restricted free agent Tyler Huntley, who is likely to return to the organization after being assigned a $2.6 million tender for next season. Despite his unlikely trip to the Pro Bowl last season, he averaged just 5.8 yards per attempt and posted a 49.5 QBR over the past two seasons. (Jackson is at 57.9 over that same stretch.) Huntley has gone 3-5 as a starter since 2021, but the Ravens scored just five touchdowns in his five starts last season. If Jackson is not going to be around, they can't rely on Huntley as the starter."}, {"source": "espn", "title": "Mavs' Kyrie Irving says fighting for play-in not what he expected", "text": "PHILADELPHIA -- After the Dallas Mavericks lost for the 14th time in 20 games since Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic took the court as teammates, Irving said this was far from where he expected the team to be when he arrived in Dallas almost two months ago.  Irving, speaking after Wednesday night's 116-108 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers at Wells Fargo Center, said the major question he has now is what does the Mavs' future look like?   I think that now, again, just where we are in the season, and where other teams are positioned already, it kind of looks like a bit of a clusterf---, to be honest with you,  Irving said.  Because we're 37-40, and we're trying to fight to get into the play-in game. It's not the expectations I don't think any of us had in that locker room.   Irving, who had 23 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists in 40 minutes, said adjusting to being traded at midseason for the first time in his NBA career has introduced him to  a lot of newness  after his time with the Brooklyn Nets came to an abrupt end.   I didn't expect to ask for a trade at that point in the season,  he said.  So I wanted to finish out with Brooklyn, finish out with the season that we had going, and I didn't get a chance to do that. So some of the goals I had previously this season had to be shifted, and I had to be more than willing, which I am, to be flexible and adaptable and live with the results, whether we make the playoffs or not.   I just have to be at peace with where I am and which I am, and trust of the guys that I'm going to be in that war room with every single day. So, I'm appreciative of them giving me the opportunity. It's been nothing but great here. And I've been at peace.   Irving added:  So it's been good -- outside of the losses, of course. We'd like to win every game.   Wins have been few and far between for Dallas over the past several weeks, as the Mavericks have lost five of six games to tumble all the way out of the play-in spots in the Western Conference. Since trading for Irving, the Mavericks are 9-14 -- and 6-14 since he and Doncic played together for the first time Feb. 11 in Sacramento.  The Mavs' loss to Philadelphia, coupled with the Oklahoma City Thunder winning against the Detroit Pistons on a last-second putback by rookie Jalen Williams, has Dallas sitting a game behind the Thunder for the 10th and final play-in spot in the West.  To make matters worse for the Mavericks (37-40), Oklahoma City also holds the tiebreaker by virtue of winning the season series. So, Dallas now heads to Miami, where it will play the Heat on Saturday before visiting the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday in back-to-backs, before returning to Dallas to end the season with home games against Sacramento, Chicago and San Antonio.   It's definitely frustrating,  said Doncic, who had 24 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in Wednesday's loss.  We were in a playoff spot and now we're trying to get in the play-in, so it's obviously frustrating.   Dallas had its chances against Philadelphia (50-26), which got stars James Harden (Achilles) and Joel Embiid (calf) back, but looked like a team that was playing in a fourth time zone in the span of a week. As a result, Dallas stayed in control for large stretches of the game, only to allow Philadelphia to make strong closing runs over the final couple of minutes of the second and third quarters (9-2 and 10-5, respectively).  Philadelphia outscored Dallas 16-5 over the final seven minutes to secure the win.  Irving said that losing has been tough and that the Mavs have had to  go through growing pains as a team.    We're learning each other on the fly and just learning how to win ballgames and keep a mental edge over our opponents no matter who we're playing,  he said.  So we're definitely learning in that direction. But in terms of the now where we are controlling our present destiny as a team going against the Sixers, I feel like we had a great chance to win this game, and, you know, just our poise down the stretch just wasn't at a high level that we needed to get this win, and they took full advantage of it.   Despite finding themselves outside of the play-in spots with 10 days remaining in the regular season, Irving, Doncic and Mavericks coach Jason Kidd all expressed optimism that the team still has time to get itself sorted out.   I think it's always possible,  Kidd said.  It's, you know, just your belief system -- if you believe in it and have positive energy and not be selfish. That's where it starts. It's about the team. You win as a team, and you lose as a team, and you try to get better as a team.   It's not just, you know, [Kyrie] and Luka. Everyone got open shots tonight, and we just got to be able to make them. When you look at [Reggie Bullock's] first 3, he makes it, and they couldn't buy one. Maxi [Kleber] makes one and then turns some down. But, you know, we've talked about making the right play, make or miss, that's the way you got to live. If you start to turn things down, it turns to the basketball gods will go against you. So we just got to, you know, stay together, stay positive and find a way to win in Miami.   When Doncic was asked about the process of building chemistry, though, he said there's no time to worry about that.   I mean, I don't think it's about chemistry,  he said.  We just got to win games. That's it.

The company's fifth-generation Driver AI is coming to the region at the same time.  The Alphabet-owned brand is unsurprisingly eager to tout the environmental perks.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) unsealed the third round of criminal charges against SBF in a superseding indictment; SBF has now pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges. Additionally, he faces civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). His attorney, Mark Cohen, claimed he would file a motion that SBF can't be tried on charges brought after his extradition from the Bahamas in December.  Federal prosecutors allege SBF and his partners tried  numerous  legal and personal methods to unfreeze the funds before moving forward with the bribe. They say SBF directed Alameda Research, FTX's sister company, to transfer more than $40 million to a private wallet.

CEO David Holz says on Discord that the company is ending free trials due to  extraordinary demand and trial abuse.  New safeguards haven't been  sufficient  to prevent misuse during trial periods, Holz says. For now, you'll have to pay at least $10 per month to use the technology.

I reckon there's a couple of generations who were raised, in whole or part, by their televisions. With surrogate parents who showed us a better way of living was possible and that the easy solution isn't always best. Jean-Luc Picard was a leader of principle, with backbone and a belief that humanism should always prevail. When given the chance to eradicate the Borg, who had tortured, dehumanized and used him as a meat puppet to murder thousands of his colleagues, he demurred. In his own version of the Trolley Problem, he was initially in favor of wiping them out until his colleagues, including an aghast Dr. Crusher, convinced him otherwise. Their objections helped reawaken his humanity and reminded him that there was a better way.  Star Trek: Picard doesn't just feel its lead made the wrong decision back then, it abdicates any sort of debate to justify why the alternative is better. Holding an unarmed Vadic prisoner on the Titan, Picard and Crusher agree the only course of action is to execute her. This comes after Crusher has already conceived building a new anti-changeling virus, only giving a second's thought to the notion that it would be genocidal. Crusher, so often Star Trek: The Next Generation's most moral compass, even says that Picard's trap has invited death upon the Titan. When Jack is threatened, there's no contemplation of alternatives or smarter solutions beyond those found at the business-end of a phaser. Are we watching Star Trek or 24?  But, to be even-handed, it's also possible to offer a weaker, but present, argument that Picard is wrestling with America's position in a post-Iraq world. Since the Dominion War has been retrofitted (pretty perfectly) as a War on Terror analog, then the changeling virus must now be seen as equivalent to the invasion itself. Shaw has given voice to the idea more than once that the changeling virus has radicalized a generation of zealots looking for revenge. But if that's the case, why is there not a greater examination of what any of that would mean in the real world?

And it's clearly something that Trek of old engaged with, in  Descent,  Picard wrestles with the decision made in  I, Borg,  telling Riker  the moral thing to do was not the right thing to do.  A better venue for this, however, was in Deep Space Nine, a show much better suited to painting its canvas in shades of gray than The Next Generation's beige-carpeted explorers.  In The Pale Moonlight,  arguably the best hour of Trek ever made, makes the case that killing two people will save billions more, and makes it well. But Avery Brooks and Andrew Robinson's performances both show that while they can make that case intellectually, neither has anything close to a clean conscience.  As for the rest of the episode, Picard hatches a plan to trap the Shrike and lure Vadic on board by playing possum, which leads to some phaser-fu fights when Jack realizes that he's telepathic, enough to pass his punch-fight knowledge onto LaForge. Meanwhile, we learn that Vadic is, or was, a sinister Section 31 scientist who merged with one of her changeling captors, and a changeling that she was torturing and experimenting on has vowed revenge on the Federation. At this point, my sympathies are almost lurching toward the changelings."}, {"source": "engadget", "title": "Apple's 'Tetris' movie trades real-life drama for spy fantasies | Engadget", "text": "No, the origins of Tetris didn't involve a high-speed car chase, but the true story behind the game still reads like a spy novel. There's corporate intrigue, nefarious government agencies and an envious amount of globe-trotting. But the reality wasn't enough for the creative minds behind Apple's Tetris film, which premieres on March 31st. Director Jon S. Baird and writer Noah Pink couldn't help but spice up the story with hyperactive pixel art, cartoonishly evil villains and wildly discordant tonal shifts. The result is a film that may entertain general audiences - or critics who have somehow never heard of Tetris before - but will probably leave true aficionados of the game cold.  From its opening scenes, in which a young Henk Rogers (The Kingsman's Taron Egerton) recounts the magical moment he encountered Tetris at CES, the film aims for the snappy dialog of Aaron Sorkin's scripts for The Social Network and Steve Jobs. But it never reaches those heights. Rogers is the entrepreneur responsible for working together with Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Efremov), the Soviet programmer who created Tetris, to bring the game to the rest of the world. He makes for a compelling main character on paper, and yet the film doesn't delve too deeply into why he'd risk his life and business (he was the founder of Japan's Bullet-Proof Software) for a single game.  Apple  Call that a failure of storytelling, or perhaps it's just dramatic shorthand. Rogers is one of the first people to become truly obsessed with Tetris, and that alone defines his actions. Throughout the movie he and others experience the  Tetris effect  - hallucinating falling blocks after playing the game. That's a practically universal response to playing Tetris for an extended period. The world quickly fades out of view while you're focusing on those shapes, and its effect on you lingers for days.  In this film, that's shown in the most basic way possible: A hallucinatory display of shapes right in front of someone's eyes. But I couldn't help but imagine how a more artful take would have looked. Think Tetris by way of Darren Aronofsky's Pi, a movie where the lead character starts to see evidence of math in every corner of the natural world.

That being said, there's still plenty to enjoy in Tetris. Rogers' early glimpse at a Game Boy prototype, the system that would make Tetris a global phenomenon, is treated like he's encountering the Holy Grail. He immediately sees the potential for appealing not just to kids with NES consoles but even adults. You could easily call it the first casual video game. Ben Miles and Togo Igawa also do a fine job of embodying Nintendo royalty, former Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln and the company's third president, Hiroshi Yamauchi."}, {"source": "engadget", "title": "Apple's M2 Pro Mac mini is back to a record-low price at Amazon | Engadget", "text": "All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

So when the car recently came to New York City for its North American debut, we couldn't pass up the chance to check it out because it might just be the best-looking new SUV in 2023.  The Polestar 3 is built on the same platform as the Volvo EX90, but the company has made some significant changes that ensures there won't be confusion between the two. Instead of three rows of seats, the Polestar 3 maxes out at two, with slightly less rear storage in favor of a more spacious cabin. So despite a relatively low roof line, the combination of a glass roof, a long wheelbase and rear seats that are reclined a bit more than usual gave me and my 6-foot frame a very relaxed seating position with tons of leg room. There were even a couple throw pillows in the back seat, which might be a bit unnecessary, but really adds to the premium loungey feel Polestar is going for.  Meanwhile, in front the Polestar 3 features a more enclosed cockpit-style layout, mixed with a bit of Scandinavian minimalism. There's a big armrest and an extended console featuring a built-in wireless charger. As for infotainment, Polestar is continuing to use a system based on Android Automotive centered around a big 14.5-inch touchscreen with Google Maps as your default navigation system and a very familiar touch-based UI. Like in a lot of modern cars, pretty much everything from climate control to music is handled on the display, with the only physical controls being a big knob on the console for volume/play/pause along with some additional haptic touch points on the steering wheel.  On the outside, the Polestar sports a much more aggressive design than the EX90, thanks to dual wings (one on the hood and one above the rear window), a front splitter, big wheels (either 21 or 22 inches depending the spec) and a new two bladed-version of the company's signature Thor's Hammer headlights. I know not everyone will agree, but I think the Polestar 3 looks fantastic. It's got just enough futuristic sci-fi design cues without going overboard like Tesla's Cybertruck.

Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget  The Polestar has the tech to back up its sci-fi looks too. In addition to things like automatic lane keeping and blindspot detection, it features a bevy of monitoring components including 12 ultrasonic sensors, five exterior radars, five cameras, two driver monitoring sensors and even four interior radars spread throughout the car. The most important use of these new sensors is that alongside the EX90, the Polestar 3 will be one of the first cars to offer an onboard passenger detection system as standard.  This means in the event a child or a pet is left in the back seat (or the trunk), the car will warn the driver, prevent the car from being locked and will continue to maintain a safe climate unless a manual override is given. The goal is to prevent any occupants from overheating if left in the car, which is sadly a very preventable cause of death that's occurred to more than 900 children in the U.S. since 1998.  Another interesting feature is the Polestar 3's headlights which feature a 1.3-megapixel DLP sensor that allows the car to more easily focus and adjust its beams to suit the driving conditions. And while it wasn't on the model we saw, Polestar says the 3 will also have an optional Pilot Pack that includes a LiDAR sensor from Luminar and an NVIDIA Drive Orin chip, which will support some level of autonomous or semi-autonomous driving capabilities.

That said, possibly my favorite thing about the Polestar 3 is the way the carmaker has integrated the vehicle's design, tech and sustainability into a single cohesive package. Little elements like labeling the size of the Polestar 3's battery on the outside of the car, right next to its name, help add a sense of transparency to its construction. As a part-time design nerd, the little labels everywhere are like a typographer's dream. On top of that, Polestar is even using blockchain technology to trace the origins of the components that go into the car's battery, to make sure they are coming from conflict-free regions. And when you pair all this with a striking design, you get a really enchanting vision of where the EV market is heading.  However, I still have two main concerns about the Polestar 3: its pricing and its energy efficiency. With the standard dual-motor long-range model starting at $83,900 or $89,900 for the Performance Pack model, this clearly isn't an EV for the masses. And with the number of luxury electric SUVs like the BMW iX and others hitting the roads, Polestar is wading into an increasingly competitive market.  Photo by Sam Rutherford/Engadget  On top of that, despite costing $30,000 more than a Tesla Model Y and having a big 111 kWh battery (versus just 75kWh for the Tesla), the Polestar 3 is currently only expected to get around 300 miles of range compared to 330 for the Model Y. And it's a similar situation for the Polestar's 250 kW DC charging, which isn't quite as fast as what you'd get from a similar but less expensive rival like the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Granted, the Polestar has yet to receive its final official range figures from the EPA, but just going by the numbers we have so far, its battery and charging tech aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. Still, the Polestar 3 looks great and hopefully we'll know more later this year when the car goes on sale for real sometime in Q4."}, {"source": "cbc-news", "title": "She's lived in Portapique for 23 years.

And here's the twist: It's an absolute lark, a fun fleeted-footed adventure that will amuse D&D diehards and those who don't know their mimics from their mind flayers .  (There have been several previous versions of Dungeons & Dragons over the years, including an animated series and a number of forgettable live-action features .)  WATCH | Trailer for Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves:  If you've played Dungeons & Dragons you'll know the key to a good campaign is the balance around the table. It's all how you choose your characters. You need a mix of brains, stealth and skullduggery for a good raiding party. The same applies to casting and this where the writer and directing duo John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein excel.  It all starts with Chris Pine, back in Kirk mode as Edgin.  Edgin is no starship captain but the bard-turned-thief shares Kirk's devil-may-care attitude and bottomless sense of confidence. Edgin is the man with a plan. Although sometimes it's just a notion. Maybe a vague idea. With his only weapons his steely blue eyes and surprisingly resilient lute, Edgin joins forces with a brawny barbarian named Holga. No stranger to playing rough and tough characters, here Michelle Rodridguez gets to flex her funny muscles as a woman of few words who loves potatoes and bashing and little else.  Hugh Grant, directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, Michelle Rodriguez, Chris Pine and crew on the set of Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves. (Aidan Monaghan)  Since it wouldn't be D&D without a wizard, Justice Smith joins the crew as Simon, a young magic maker with performance anxiety. Ever since Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom I've enjoyed the awkward energy Smith brings to his characters and the haphazard Simon continues the trend. Add in Sophia Lillis as Doric, a spirited shape shifter, and the gang's all here.  The bones of the actual quest revolve around dethroning Hugh Grant as Forge, a slippery team member who upgraded to royalty. Grant is clearly in his happy place, smirking and scheming as the con man developing a taste for finer things. For some extra firepower, Forge joins forces with fearsome red wizard named Sofina.  Pine plays Edgin and Rege-Jean Page plays Xenk. Edgin has his wits and a lute. Xenk has his courage and absolutely no sense of humour. (Paramount Pictures)  Like any good game there are multiple side quests and diversions. Magical helmets beckon. Corpses must be interrogated and there's a surprisingly corpulent dragon to avoid.  Bridgerton fans will enjoy the entrance of Rege-Jean Page as a paladin. As someone who only dabbled in D&D, I'm not quite sure what a paladin does. But I instantly appreciated the hilarity of this self-serious warrior with a positively Vulcan approach to sarcasm.  Hugh Grant is enjoying his villian era as Forge, the slippery con man. (Aidan Monaghan)  The directors, Daley and Goldstien, are also responsible for Game Night and co-wrote Spider-Man: Homecoming -- all stories that take the logic of the premise seriously while embracing the absurdity. Honor Among Thieves accepts the fantasy underpinnings of the genre, but leaves room the for the character to react.  What makes it work are the real emotional stakes many of the characters have. Edgin is the kind of charming rogue Chris Pine was born to play, but what drives him is a sense of guilt over choices that affected the ones he loves. Pine is good enough actor to give us a sense of who Edgin was and could be again. Even Holga gets her own semi-tragic backstory with a great cameo, a love more powerful than potatoes, remarkably unspoiled by the trailer.  The band of thieves attempt to uncover yet another magical item. (Aidan Monaghan)  For the hardcore players the film is littered with reference to D&D lore from a giant gelatinous cube to the impressive Owlbear Doric the shape shifter becomes. If you've never rolled a 20 sided die or wondered what your character's health points are don't worry. Think of Honor Among Thieves as Lord of the Rings Lite. Less ponderous, with plenty of laughs.

But some say they were  pleasantly surprised  Thursday to see strong criticism of the RCMP and clear recommendations for how to make Canadians safer.  The Mass Casualty Commission released its lengthy report with 130 recommendations to a packed room in Truro, N.S.   We were pleasantly surprised,  said Darcy Dobson, daughter of victim Heather O'Brien.  We didn't expect them to crack down so hard on the policing in this province as hard as they did. So, that was great, actually, because there definitely needs to be some change in policing.   It was really nice to actually see somebody is listening.   Dobson said she still thinks the inquiry itself was a  flawed  process that retraumatized the families, while certain RCMP officers were protected by not having to answer direct questions from family lawyers. She said that's why many people had  low expectations  for the report.  But she said it was good to see the level of detail about how RCMP actions put people in danger, and structures like provincial mental-health services failed families.  Dobson said the RCMP treated families poorly both during and after the mass shootings, leaving them to  jump through hoops  to get any information, and next of kin notifications were often done poorly.  The main recommendations that stuck out to her were structural changes with the RCMP, and a review of the national Alert Ready system.  When asked what her mom would think, Dobson said:  I hope that she would be proud, I really do. And I know that she would have done the exact same thing for me or any one of my siblings.

(CBC)  The report sets out findings on how and why things happened as they did across those two days, and outlines recommendations for police, governments and individuals.  Those recommendations include calls for major changes to RCMP oversight, processes and culture; a process to rethink the structure of policing in Nova Scotia; a national review of public alerting; greater focus on addressing intimate partner violence; and a much expanded collaborative model to ensure community safety.  Charlene Bagley, who lost her father, Tom Bagley, agreed that she was happy with such a wide-ranging report that  looks really good on paper.    Whether everything gets done that says it's going to be done moving forward, we will see,  Bagley said.  Charlene Bagley, daughter of victim Tom Bagley, says she is glad that the report's release means a chapter has closed, but will now push for recommendations to be implemented. (CBC)  The past few months since the inquiry's public proceedings ended have been the start of her own  healing process, finally  Bagley said, touching the purple necklace that holds the remains of her dad.  Bagley said she thinks her father would be glad that this chapter is now over, so she and her mother can move on.   He wouldn't want us hurting,  Bagley said.  He'd want us happy so I'll try to do that for him, but in the meantime I'm just not giving up -- and he knows that.   My hope is that they will follow through.

If there's a body to hold them accountable ... then at least there's that positive side of it. There's no sneaking away from anything,  MacLeod said.  While MacLeod said nothing will bring his brother back, but if changes are made then  these people didn't lose their lives for nothing.    If it makes a positive change that's nationwide, it'll be appreciated I know by families,  MacLeod said.

(Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press)  Michael MacDonald, chair of the Mass Casualty Commission, and fellow commissioners Leanne Fitch and Kim Stanton spoke about the need for action now after the release of their 3,000-page report.   We do not shy away from declaring hard truths and accountability. We identify them precisely so we can learn from them and do better,  MacDonald said.   Future acts of violence are preventable if we have the will to do what is necessary.   The event began with a montage of photos of the 22 people who died in the tragedy followed by a moment of silence.  MacDonald led his remarks by thanking the families of those killed in the rampage for their  unwavering courage and commitment.  The victims, who included a pregnant woman, were killed by a gunman posing as an RCMP officer over 13 hours.   This is a blueprint that can make Canada a world leader when it comes to community safety,  MacDonald said.  N.S. mass shooting report condemns RCMP failures Duration 3:06 An inquiry into the 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia has delivered a scathing report denouncing the RCMP's actions during the crisis. With 130 recommendations in total, the Mass Casualty Commission recommended a major overhaul to the RCMP.   When implemented, it will establish that those wonderful, dear lives that were taken on April 18 and 19 would not have been taken in vain. Those lives cannot have been taken in vain -- that cannot happen.   Speaking with the media after his remarks, MacDonald defended the commission's decision to limit direct questions from family lawyers for key witnesses like RCMP officers and the gunman's partner, Lisa Banfield.   We set up a system for each witness, tailor-made, that got the best information from them,  he said.  I believe our report dispels any criticism in that regard.   I challenge anyone to suggest that we did not get all the information. We did.   Fitch was clear that a culture change in the RCMP is not a case of  we think that it can change,  but  it must change,  especially given that many reports in the past have called for that transformation.   This isn't just something that is directed at the RCMP in Canada, this is policing in Canada. It's time to rethink the roles and responsibilities, and how to share the responsibility of community safety and well-being with everyone,  Fitch told reporters.  The commissioners also thanked key politicians including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston, and federal Minister of Public Safety Marco Mendicino, for attending the release of the report in person.   It is so important that you are here. Our recommendations call for transformative change, they call for collaboration, they call for leadership,  MacDonald said.   They call for you to champion these recommendations so that our communities in Nova Scotia and Canada will be safer.

Their backgrounds vary: two friends who grew up together in Pakistan, an 18-year-old spending an evening with friends, a renowned photographer.  Many were staying at rented rooms in the building; one of them had lived there for more than 30 years.  All spent their final moments inside the building off of Place D'Youville, where, in the early morning hours of March 16, a fire broke out under circumstances that Montreal police are still investigating.  Friends and family members came to the area in the days and weeks after the blaze, some of them leaving flowers near the charred stone facade as firefighters carefully searched through the debris for victims.  That search is now over, Montreal police said last week, after they pulled the last two bodies from the structure.  Here is what we know about the victims:  Dania Zafar  Dania Zafar, 32, from Toronto was 'in the wrong place at the wrong time,' her family said. (Submitted by Zafar Mahmood)  Dania Zafar, a Pakistani national living in Toronto, was staying on the third floor of the building the night it caught fire.  Zafar had planned to stay in an Airbnb rental unit in the building in Old Montreal for one night, according to her father, Zafar Mahmood. She called her family in Pakistan by video call the evening before the blaze and gave them a tour of her Airbnb unit, which she said she picked because she admired its character.   I think she was at the wrong place at the wrong time with all the odds against her and we lost her,  Mahmood said through tears.  His daughter was a dreamer, he said. She was a free spirit who had moved abroad to study fine arts and managed her own online business.  She wanted to do things in her own way,  Mahmood said.  Zafar was also friendly and kind. She kept a collection of houseplants at her apartment in Toronto, she loved cats and she left an impression on everyone she met.  Saniya Khan  Mazhar Khan, with his daughter, Saniya Mazhar Khan, 31. She was visiting Montreal with her childhood friend. (Submitted by Mazhar Khan)  Saniya Khan, a 32-year-old doctor from Pakistan who was studying medicine in Detroit, was best friends with Dania Zafar. They had met as children in Pakistan and were inseparable, Saniya's father, Mazhar Khan, said in an interview.  They shared a love of travel and writing and were working on a novel together, he said.  Saniya Khan was working toward a master's in public health, but she made time to speak to her father, calling him practically every day, he said.  Mazhar Khan described his daughter as a selfless person who always thought of others. She cared for her family whenever they needed her. She knew what people around her needed sometimes before they knew, he said.   I feel like part of my body, part of my heart is gone,  he said.  Walid Belkahla  Montreal police and fire officials identified Walid Belkahla, 18, on Tuesday March 28 as one of the victims of a fire in an Old Montreal heritage building. (Les Algeriens de Montreal/Facebook)  Walid Belkahla, an 18-year-old student, was spending an evening with friends downtown the night of the fire. The night ran late and a friend invited Belkahla to stay at a rented room, which he did, according to his father, Raba Belkahla.  Raba said he was proud of his son, whom he described as a good student who applied himself and did volunteer work in the community.  Charlie Lacroix  Charlie Lacroix, 18, was staying at an Airbnb the night of the fire. (gofundme.com)  Charlie Lacroix, 18, was a happy girl who lit up a room, according to her friends and family who came to the site of the fire last week to  say goodbye.    She was a little ball of joy and she always knew what to say,  said Kelly Ann, who said Lacroix was her best friend.  She was always there for everyone. She was a good person and she was so young. She had her whole life ahead of her.   Lacroix was staying at an Airbnb the night of the fire. Robert Lacas, her grandfather, said she made urgent 911 calls, saying there were no windows in her unit -- and no way to escape the flames -- before the call cut out.   She was a happy little girl. That's all I can say. She was joyful,  he said, his voice breaking.  She was really really nice.   An Wu  An Wu was in Montreal for conference on computational neuroscience. She was staying in an Airbnb in the Old Montreal building. (Submitted by Pantong Yao)  An Wu's friends and family remember her as a devoted scientist and a gifted scholar.  Wu, 31, was in Montreal to participate in an academic conference about computational neuroscience and was staying at an Airbnb in the building.  Born in China, she was recognized as a gifted child and began attending college at age 19, according to a friend, Pantong Yao.  She was doing post-doctoral research at the University of California San Diego and would spend hours in the lab trying to find the answer to a question.   An was a really diligent person and really devoted herself to science,  Yao said, conveying a message from one of Wu's family members.  Nathan Sears  Nathan Sears was in Montreal for a conference on international studies and was staying in an Airbnb in Old Montreal when it caught fire, trapping people inside. (Nathan Sears/Facebook)  Nathan Sears, an academic from Toronto who holds a PhD in political science, was in town for the International Studies Association conference held at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth hotel.  Sears was listed as having taken part in the International Studies Association conference held in Montreal the week of the fire.  We are all devastated,  University of Toronto professor Steven Bernstein, who was Sears's PhD thesis supervisor, wrote in an email.  Camille Maheux  Montreal police identified Camille Maheux as one of the victims of a fire that destroyed a building in the historic neighbourhood of Old Montreal. (Self-portrait by Camille Maheux/Submitted by Petunia Alves)  Camille Maheux, a documentary photographer whose work captured the women's movement and the lives of LGBTQ people beginning in the early 1970s, had lived in the building for 30 years.  Buster Fraum, a former neighbour of hers, said Maheux was a colourful and warm character who would regale him with stories of her worldly life and career.   Camille was really, really eccentric in the most delightful of ways,  he said.  Maheux's work was exhibited across Canada, Europe and in Brazil, where she was based on and off in the 1980s, a friend said. Maheux even hosted a program on Brazilian music on CIBL, a francophone community radio station in Montreal.

It describes it as an epidemic that, like the COVID-19 pandemic, warrants a  meaningful, whole of society response.    We agree that recognizing gender-based, intimate partner, and family violence as an epidemic is a valuable first step ...needed to prevent and eradicate these forms of violence,  write the members of the Mass Casualty Commission.   The word 'epidemic' signifies the scope of the problem as prevailing and sweeping, and also speaks to its toxic and unhealthy character.   The commission made 17 recommendations to address gender-based violence, including  epidemic-level funding  for agencies and organizations devoted to intervention. Amid the calls for systemic change by governments, law enforcement and regulators is an appeal to men to take up  individual and concerted action  to contribute to ending the epidemic.   Our aim is not to demonize all men as perpetrators of violence,  reads the report.   At the same time, we believe men can take responsibility for ending violence in our communities by disrupting traditional norms and harmful expressions of masculinity.   Avalon Sexual Assault Centre responds to MCC recommendations Duration 5:35 Kristina Fifield with the Avalon Sexual Assault Centre tells the CBC's Amy Smith a cultural shift is necessary in situations where a person is experiencing violence and abuse.  On Thursday, commissioner Michael MacDonald said it's time men start acknowledging the realities of gender-based violence and do their part.   Women have been carrying, through community-based organizations, the burden of protecting women almost exclusively for far too long,  he said.  Men who are leaders in society have to call it out for what it is -- it's an epidemic.  The commissioners note the April 2020 shootings happened after a number of systemic failures around enforcement and intervention, primarily by police, in the years before the mass shootings. The gunman had a history of violent behaviour against his patients, neighbours and his common-law spouse, Lisa Banfield.  The failure of police to respond to multiple reports of the gunman's violence is an example of the ways  in which we fail to adequately address gender-based violence,  write the commissioners.   For far too long, we have misperceived mass violence as our greatest threat without considering its relationship to other more pervasive forms of violence,  states the report.  We do so at the expense of public safety and community well-being.   Missed opportunities to intervene  The authors write that the gunman's pattern and escalation of violence could have been addressed before the killings, noting  many red flags  about his violent and illegal behaviour were known by a broad range of people.   All too often, gender-based, intimate partner and family violence are precursors to the forms of violence that are more readily seen as being of broader 'public' concern,  states the report.   We ignore these forms of violence at our collective peril.   Relatives told the commission the gunman was abused by his father as a child, and Banfield described the abuse she suffered during their 19-year relationship in detail during several interviews with police and the commission.  Neighbours and friends of the couple also described several incidents of the gunman attacking Banfield in front of them -- though the report notes  no effective action was taken  to interrupt the perpetrator's violence. On two occasions, other people had reported the assaults on her to police, but the police never tried to speak with her.  The MCC report was released Thursday morning in Truro. (Brooklyn Currie/CBC)  The report notes that the gunman benefited from preferential treatment and implicit bias in police decision-making due to his status as a white, wealthy man who owned his own denturist practice.  It describes barriers to reporting by women who were assaulted as well as community members, which included a fear of retaliation and a lack of faith in an adequate police response. The impediments to reporting  resulted in missed red flags and opportunities to intercede in his behaviour.   It also notes a dismissive response by police to the complaints that were made about the gunman in 2010, 2011 and 2013, citing the speed with which the files were closed and the failure to seek out or interview any witnesses.   The perpetrator's violence ... was reported to, investigated by, and in some cases witnessed by the police with minimal repercussions or intervention,  states the report.  We identify several problematic patterns in the police response: implicit bias, failure to investigate, poor note-taking and record keeping.   Banfield re-victimized  Despite this history, the commission notes that RCMP did not treat Banfield as a survivor of the mass casualty. Months after the mass shootings, she was charged along with two of her family members with providing ammunition to the gunman. Those charges were resolved when Banfield was referred to a restorative justice process.  The report details further re-victimization in the wake of the killings -- and charges against Banfield -- by members of the public who held Banfield  somehow responsible for the mass casualty (despite the same RCMP confirming that their investigation revealed no such responsibility).    This unfair treatment flows from and perpetuates stereotypes and biases and has a potentially chilling effect on other survivors of gender-based violence,  wrote the commissioners.   She is in no way responsible for the perpetrator's actions but rather is a victim of his violent acts. She was not aware of what he was planning, nor is it reasonable to hold her responsible for the lack of reporting on his prior violent behaviours.   Lisa Banfield, centre, enters Dartmouth provincial court Tuesday holding hands with two of her sisters and followed by her lawyer, James Lockyer, in 2022. (CBC)   The way she was treated in the aftermath of this massacre, which began as an assault against her, is disgraceful,  said Banfield's lawyer Jessica Zita on Thursday.  But this report is the first step to preventing that from ever happening again.   The report calls for significant reform in police responses, citing systemic failures to respond to reports of threats, failure to charge even where mandatory charging policies are in place, failure to search for prior complaints, charges or convictions and failure to take the situation seriously.  Most notably, the report calls for a change to the Criminal Code to recognize  reactive violence  by women who are subject to coercive control as self-defence.  The recommendation is in response to input from advocates who say mandatory charging policies have failed -- either presenting a barrier to reporting or further imperilling women who face charges.   The policies have contributed significantly to the criminalization of women survivors of intimate partner violence because, when survivors retaliate as a form of self-defence, they are also charged,  write the commissioners.  Lisa Banfield's lawyer speaks out on inquiry report Duration 3:27 Jessica Zita tells CBC's Angela MacIvor that the final report of the Mass Casualty Commission validates the experience of her client, Lisa Banfield, who suffered years of abuse as the partner of the gunman who took the lives of 22 Nova Scotians in 2020.  Mass casualties can be prevented, says commission  The report notes that mass casualties are a gendered phenomenon almost universally committed by men and the pattern of escalation from gender-based violence to mass casualties is  well-documented.   While specific events like the mass shooting can't be predicted, the authors say they can be prevented by creating a system that can better recognize the warning signs and risk factors.   While no person or institution could have predicted the perpetrator's specific actions on April 18 and 19, 2020, his patterns and escalation of violence could have and should have been addressed,  write the commissioners.   It was entirely predictable that he would continue to harm people until effective intervention interrupted his patterns of behaviour.   The report provides multiple examples of areas needing reform in order to provide better security to women experiencing gender-based violence, including access to safe and affordable housing; the elimination of social or economic barriers for women leaving their partners; and most critically, stable, long-term funding for all services to prevent, intervene in and respond to gender-based violence.   Simply stated: our collective and systemic failures are attributable to the fact that we underfund women's safety,  reads the report.  Other recommendations include:  Governments, service providers, community-based organizations, and others engaged with the gender-based violence advocacy and support sector take a systemic approach to learning about and removing barriers to women survivors, with a focus on the diverse needs of marginalized women survivors and the needs of other women who are vulnerable as a result of their precarious status or situation.  Police and prosecutors should carefully consider the context of intimate partner violence when criminal charges are being contemplated against survivors of such violence; and should engage subject matter experts to help ensure that the dynamics of intimate partner violence are understood;  Provincial and territorial governments should bring in mandatory gender-based violence and bystander intervention training in grades Primary to 12  Automatically revoke the firearms licences of people convicted of domestic violence or hate-related offences, and suspend the licences of anyone charged with such offences.

Esto significa que Espana reconocera a partir de ahora la llamada autodeterminacion de genero, es decir, la posibilidad de que una persona por si misma pueda cambiarse de sexo en el DNI y todos los efectos legales sin que nadie le pueda exigir informes medicos para acreditar disforia de genero o la obligacion de hormonarse durante dos anos. Sera totalmente libre desde los 16 anos y con ciertas condiciones en funcion de la edad a partir de los 12 anos.  La aprobacion de la ley ha llegado despues de muchos meses de enconado debate politico y social sobre las implicaciones y efectos de esta norma. En ese tiempo, la ministra de Igualdad, Irene Montero, ha visto la vehemente oposicion del PP, Vox o de asociaciones feministas en contra de su texto legislativo, pero tambien por parte del PSOE. Primero en el seno del Gobierno y despues en la tramitacion en el Congreso, el socio mayoritario del Ejecutivo ha planteado importantes objeciones a la ley, incluso ha dudado sobre la constitucionalidad de aspectos como el de los menores, hasta que perdio el pulso con Unidas Podemos y acabo asumiendo el texto tal y como esta.  Han sido esas dificultades las que han llevado a la ministra de Igualdad a reconocer este jueves en el Congreso que la ley ha logrado salir adelante  contra todo pronostico .  Hemos dado un paso de gigante tan grande como hemos podido, pero muy poca gente confio en que esto fuera posible , ha senalado Montero antes de la votacion. Asimismo, ha acusado de  transfobia ,  LGTBIfobia  y de emitir bulos a sectores politicos y feministas contrarios a la nueva norma.  La Ley Trans aun cuenta con resistencias internas dentro del PSOE y el feminismo. Carmen Calvo ha vuelto a romper este jueves la disciplina de voto de su grupo y se ha abstenido, como ya hiciera la ex vicepresidenta antes cuando se voto el texto en diciembre. Tambien en el Senado una socialista se desmarco, Susanna Moll, que en su caso voto no a la Ley Trans.  Frente al entusiasmo y las celebraciones de Irene Montero por el avance  historico , el PP ha advertido de los  problemas irreversibles  que va a provocar la ley por la ausencia de  salvaguardas  como pasar por un medico. Principalmente entre los menores de edad que den pasos para cambiar de sexo y que luego se arrepientan tras hormonarse. Asi, el PP ha alertado del sufrimiento y de las  lagrimas  que les esperan por la desproteccion a la que se les somete. Por eso, ha sentenciado que la Ley Trans se va convertir en un  nuevo si es si .  La diputada Maria Jesus Moro ha incidido en que entonces no servira que Pedro Sanchez diga tres meses despues, como con la ley de libertad sexual, que hay que corregir.  No estamos para experimentar con las personas. No queremos que dias despues comience un nuevo conteo insoportable de victimas , ha dicho, afirmando que estamos ante un  remake del solo si es si  y denunciando que Espana ignora los pasos atras que se estan dando en otros paises con leyes trans como Suecia, Reino Unido o Finlandia, con especial hincapie en el caso de Escocia.  La ley, que trae consigo un importante paquete de avances en derechos para las personas trans y tambien LGTBI, tiene como punto central la autodeterminacion de genero. Sera completamente libre desde los 16 anos. Para los menores por debajo de ese umbral de edad se establecen ciertos condicionantes hasta los 12 anos, que es la edad minima en la que se puede pedir el cambio legal.  Entre los 14 y los 16 anos se exige tener el permiso de los padres pero si hubiera desacuerdo con ellos, los jovenes pueden acudir a un defensor judicial para conseguirlo. Entre los 12 y los 14 anos las solicitudes de cambio de sexo necesitan el aval de un juez. Por debajo de los 12 anos, los ninos trans podran cambiar de nombre y ser tratados acorde a su identidad en los centros escolares pero no podran cambiar aun juridicamente su sexo.  El tema de los menores de edad ha sido uno de los grandes focos de debate en la Ley Trans, porque fue el PSOE quien presento una enmienda a la ley para extender la exigencia del aval judicial hasta los 16 anos. El choque entre los socios por ese tema fue furibundo y se acabo resolviendo en una tensa votacion en la Comision de Igualdad del Congreso en la que los socialistas se quedaron solos. A partir de ahi, el PSOE asumio la derrota e hizo suyo el texto, rehusando a seguir con ese batalla pese a la opinion de Carmen Calvo.  La Ley Trans ha tenido que volver al Congreso este jueves porque en el Senado se introdujeron cambios tecnicos de caracter menor. Por eso no se ha producido una votacion sobre el conjunto sino que ha habido dos sobre las enmiendas aprobadas en la Camara Alta, en las que ha habido diferentes posicionamientos entre los partidarios de la ley. En todo caso, el texto sale avalado por una amplia mayoria del Congreso que ronda los 190 votos y el respaldo de formaciones como PSOE, Unidas Podemos, ERC, PNV, EH Bildu,Junts o Mas Pais. Tiene el rechazo de PP y Vox.  Los de Santiago Abascal han sido la otra gran voz critica en la sesion. Vox ha denunciado que la ley  confunde derechos con deseos , que  multiplicara  el numero de varones que se registraran como mujeres por  la banalizacion del cambio de sexo  y que habra  dolor y sufrimiento  para ninos y adolescentes.  La foto de la victoria de Montero  La aprobacion definitiva de la ley, como viene ocurriendo en los ultimos meses, ha sido recibida con division por parte del feminismo. Minutos despues del cierre de la sesion parlamentaria, Irene Montero y otros altos cargos de Igualdad han salido a la plaza de las Cortes para, en la escalera de acceso al Congreso, posar para una fotografia junto a representantes de asociaciones defensoras de los derechos de las personas trans.  No obstante, la instantanea ha quedado marcada por otra concentracion paralela que se estaba celebrando en ese momento tambien frente a la Camara Baja. Asociaciones feministas criticas reclamaban la dimision de la ministra Montero por, con su gestion, abandonar y dilapidar la lucha feminista y contribuir al borrado de las mujeres.  Varias decenas de feministas han clamado  ministra dimision ,  el feminismo no se vende  o  ministerio patriarcal  al mismo tiempo que la cupula de Igualdad, arropando a las asociaciones trans, celebraba que los derechos de las personas trans ya quedan reflejados en la legislacion."}, {"source": "el-mundo", "title": "Sanchez desecha las presiones de Podemos y les reta a hacer publicas sus propuestas para reformar de la ley del 'solo si es si'", "text": "El Gobierno atraviesa su crisis mas grave a raiz de la reforma de la ley del solo si es si, con un choque tenso entre el PSOE y Podemos respecto a la subida de penas, decidida por La Moncloa, obligada por la cascada de rebajas de penas a agresores sexuales. Un conflicto enquistado en el que Pedro Sanchez tomo la determinacion de resolver la cuestion, trasladar el mensaje de que el Ejecutivo actuaba, tras dos meses de negociacion fallida entre Justicia e Igualdad. El presidente del Gobierno afea las presiones y la actitud de su socio porque, esgrime, la unica propuesta conocida que esta sobre la mesa es la del PSOE. Considera que seria interesante que se hicieran publicas todas las propuestas.  Sanchez, que protagoniza esta semana una minigira europea por Austria, Croacia y Eslovenia, como primera piedra para construir la presidencia espanola de la UE a partir de junio, esta convencido de que la reforma para subir las penas en la ley del solo si es si saldra adelante, sin cerrar puertas al apoyo del PP. En una conversacion informal con los periodistas que lo acompanan en este viaje, el jefe del Ejecutivo ha remandado que  lo importante  es resolver esta cuestion. Para Sanchez esa es la prioridad, sacar adelante una reforma  tecnica , asi lo califica,  quirurgica , porque, entiende, no se trata de una cuestion politica, sino de una cuestion  tecnica y juridica .  Este planteamiento choca con lo expresado en los ultimos dias por la ministra de Igualdad, Irene Montero, que de manera reiterada ha expresado que no estamos ante una  discrepancia tecnica , sino ante una  discrepancia politica profunda  porque, entienden desde su Ministerio y desde Podemos, el planteamiento del PSOE es  volver al codigo de La Manada'  y aliarse con las pretensiones del PP.  Estas criticas vertidas desde su socio molestan tanto en el PSOE como en La Moncloa. Consideran en el complejo presidencial que la clave de boveda de su decision es no olvidarse de las victimas, que son las que estan  sufriendo . Por eso, no gustan actitudes como que desde su socio se haya filtrado su propuesta para abaratar la cesta de la compra, pero no se haya conocido publicamente ningun documento sobre sus propuestas para reformar el solo si es si. Sanchez enmarca la estrategia de Podemos en el hecho de estar ya inmersos en un periodo preelectoral y que ahora los partidos buscan  visibilidad . Hay enfado con que Podemos quiera aprovechar esta crisis para poner en cuestion el ADN feminista de los socialistas.  Es evidente que, si como traslada Igualdad, han realizado y enviado hasta seis propuestas al PSOE, estos conocen y manejan los documentos. Pero es un paso mas alla, el reto de La Moncloa es que Podemos o Igualdad hagan publicas esas reformas que plantean, en la seguridad de que se constatara que la propuesta de Justicia es la que se debe acometer.  En el transcurso de la conversacion con los periodistas, Sanchez ha reiterado que solo hay una propuesta conocida encima de la mesa que, insiste, no afecta a la esencia de la norma, al consentimiento y que, a dia de hoy, no preven que haya un pleno extraordinario para aprobar la reforma. No le incomoda que la votacion pueda producirse en la antesala del 8-M, porque considera que hay que dejar tiempo a la tramitacion parlamentaria. No desecha que haya acuerdo, pero la via seria que Podemos asumiera la propuesta socialista porque, defiende, el PSOE ya ha fijado su posicion.  Este choque por la ley del solo si es si ha llevado a los dos partidos que sustentan el Gobierno a iniciar una pugna por acaparar apoyos parlamentarios con el proposito de aislar y buscar la soledad del otro. En este sentido, Sanchez diagnostica que no todos los socios estan con la posicion de Igualdad, que se trata de ERC y Bildu, porque otras formaciones como el PNV y PDeCAT han anticipado su predisposicion a apoyar la reforma.  Sobre la posibilidad de que la reforma de la ley del solo si es si saliera gracias al apoyo del PP, el presidente del Gobierno mantiene el discurso de los socialistas de que lo importante es que la iniciativa salga adelante y sea aprobada. Es decir, no cierra esa puerta, tesis en la que los socialistas llevan incidiendo dias.  El desafio lanzado por Sanchez ha sido recogido por la propia ministra de Igualdad, Irene Montero que, tras la aprobacion en el Congreso de la ley trans, ha mantenido las espaldas en lo alto:  La propuesta que yo quiero hacer publica es la propuesta de acuerdo, la propuesta de acuerdo de Gobierno y de la mayoria feminista del Congreso quiere que lleguemos a un acuerdo y lo hagamos antes de que se debata en el pleno la propuesta socialista, que desgraciadamente vuelve al esquema penal anterior. No podemos permitirnos como Gobierno un retroceso de los derechos de las mujeres de la mano del PP y Vox .  Crisis de Gobierno puntual y en marzo  Otro de los asuntos que tiene pendientes Sanchez es acometer una crisis de Gobierno, obligada por las salidas de las ministras Carolina Darias y Reyes Maroto como candidatas a las Alcaldias de Las Palmas y Madrid, respectivamente.  Esta obligada remodelacion ha desatado nervios en el seno del Ejecutivo, toda vez que es prerrogativa unica del presidente acometer los cambios y decidir el calado de los mismos. Bien es verdad que el pacto de Gobierno de la coalicion dejo sentado que el PSOE decidia en sus ministerios y Unidas Podemos en los suyos, por lo que si Sanchez no daba un golpe sobre la mesa, toda crisis quedaba limitada a su sector.  El jefe del Ejecutivo tiene decidido, segun ha trasladado a los periodistas, acometer la remodelacion en marzo, pese al runrun de los ultimos dias de que podria adelantarse a febrero. Lo justifica en que, por ejemplo, Maroto tiene aun proyectos pendientes que sacar adelante como el pacto nacional de industria o relativos a los fondos europeos. Se persigue tambien que estas medidas sirvan de aval a la ministra.  Sanchez expone que no tiene decididos los nombres, pero si trabajado los perfiles y que se centrara en los ministerios de Sanidad e Industria. Que el alcance de la crisis de gobierno sera  puntual . Por tanto, a dia de hoy, no habra una reestructuracion de calado ni tiene contemplada La Moncloa una ruptura de la coalicion.  Como ha venido informando este diario, en el PSOE se contemplaba ya que Sanchez ejecutara en las proximas semanas una crisis de gobierno quirurgica y que despues de las elecciones municipales y autonomicas de mayo, en funcion del resultado de estas y de como transite la relacion con Podemos, lleve a cabo una remodelacion mas profundo para tratar de tomar impulso politico y trasladar una imagen hacia el interior y el exterior con motivo de la presidencia espanola de la UE."}, {"source": "cbc-news", "title": "Vatican rejects Discovery Doctrine in response to Indigenous demands | CBC News", "text": "The Vatican's formal repudiation of colonial-era concepts that legitimized the seizure of Indigenous lands marked a symbolic step forward on Thursday, but its impact on modern policy will be the true measure of change, say Indigenous leaders.  The Doctrine of Discovery, a set of theories backed by 15th-century papal bulls, continues to form the foundation of some property law today.  A Vatican statement said the 15th-century papal bulls, or decrees,  did not adequately reflect the equal dignity and rights of Indigenous peoples  and have never been considered expressions of the Catholic faith.   On the surface it sounds good, it looks good ... but there has to be a fundamental change in attitudes, behaviour, laws and policies from that statement,  Ernie Daniels, the former chief of Long Plain First Nation in Manitoba, said in an interview on Thursday.  Daniels, who was part of the delegation that met with Pope Francis in Rome last year and then again during the pontiff's 2022 visit to Canada, said that institutions around the world still espouse colonial attitudes toward Indigenous people.   There's still a mentality out there -- they want to assimilate, decimate, terminate, eradicate Indigenous people.   Ernie Daniels, a residential school survivor and the former chief of Long Plain First Nation in Manitoba, said that the Vatican's statement must lead to fundamental change. (Trevor Brine/CBC)  Ghislain Picard, a longtime Innu leader and the regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations for Quebec and Labrador, said the news was a welcome development.   Many of those pioneers and those who were involved in that work in the last 25 years must be applauding this development,  he said.  But Picard said the move is mostly symbolic and it's yet to be seen if it will affect policy in Canada.  WATCH | A former MMIWG inquiry chief on the 'important step': Marion Buller on Catholic Church's repudiation of Doctrine of Discovery Duration 2:49 Catholic Church repudiating concepts that justified Indigenous oppression 'an important step,' said Marion Buller, who was the chief commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls from 2016 to 2019.   The Vatican seems to be washing its hands of its role in the whole colonization of our lands, and to me it would be so simple to just accept the fact that they played a role,  he said.   Reconciliation is a buzzword. But how it impacts current policy is really what's at stake here.   Manipulated for political purposes  The Vatican said the documents had been  manipulated  for political purposes by colonial powers  to justify immoral acts against Indigenous peoples that were carried out, at times, without opposition from ecclesial authorities.   The statement, from the Vatican's development and education offices, said it was right to  recognize these errors,  acknowledge the terrible effects of colonial-era assimilation policies on Indigenous people and ask for their forgiveness.  Ghislain Picard, an Innu leader and regional chief of the Assembly of First Nations for Quebec and Labrador, said the Vatican's news on Thursday was a welcome development. (Ivanoh Demers/Radio-Canada)  The statement was a response to decades of demands from Indigenous people for the Vatican to formally rescind the papal bulls that provided the Portuguese and Spanish kingdoms the religious backing to expand their territories in Africa and the Americas for the sake of spreading Christianity.  Those decrees underpin the Doctrine of Discovery, a legal concept coined in an 1823 U.S. Supreme Court decision that has come to be understood as meaning that ownership and sovereignty over land passed to Europeans because they  discovered  it.  It was cited as recently as a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision involving the Oneida Indian Nation written by the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  During Pope Francis's visit to Canada last year, during which he apologized to Indigenous people for the residential school system that forcibly removed Indigenous children from their homes, he was met with demands for a formal repudiation of the papal bulls.   The Doctrine of Discovery was a papal statement and not a justification to allow Canada to unilaterally claim sovereignty over our peoples and our lands and commit genocide. And today, the Vatican finally said what our peoples have always known,  said FSIN Chief Bobby Cameron. --@fsinations  Two Indigenous women unfurled a banner at the altar of the National Shrine of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupre on July 29 that read,  Rescind the Doctrine,  in bright red and black letters. The protesters were escorted away and the mass proceeded without incident -- although the women later marched the banner out of the basilica and draped it on the railing.  In the statement, the Vatican said:  In no uncertain terms, the Church's magisterium upholds the respect due to every human being. The Catholic Church therefore repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political 'Doctrine of Discovery.'   Root cause of a 'broken' relationship  Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada who was part of the delegation that met with Francis at the Vatican before his Canadian trip and then accompanied him throughout, said the statement was  wonderful,  resolved an outstanding issue and now puts the matter to civil authorities to revise property laws that cite the doctrine.  Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada, is shown outside of St. Peter's Square at the Vatican in March 2022. (Gregorio Borgia/The Associated Press)   The Holy Father promised that upon his return to Rome, they would begin work on a statement which was designed to allay the fears and concerns of many survivors and others concerned about the relationship between their Catholic Church and our people, and he did as he said he would do,  Fontaine told The Associated Press.   The church has done one thing, as it said it would do, for the Holy Father. Now the ball is in the court of governments, the United States and in Canada -- but particularly in the United States, where the doctrine is embedded in the law,  he said.  Michele Audette, an Innu senator who was one of the five commissioners responsible for conducting the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, said when she heard the news, she was in disbelief.  Michele Audette, a former commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, said she was in disbelief after hearing the Vatican's statement on the Doctrine of Discovery. (John Woods/The Canadian Press)   It's big,  she said in an interview on CBC Daybreak.  That doctrine made sure we did not exist or were even recognized.... It's one of the root causes of why the relationship is so broken.   Konrad Sioui, the former grand chief of the Huron-Wendat Nation, said he had long hoped the Vatican would repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery.   This news is something we've been waiting for,  he said.  This answer of the church today gives us all the hope we need because we've been deprived of our lands through this very [doctrine].   WATCH | Ontario MPP on why there's more to be done: Repudiating Doctrine of Discovery 'warms my heart' but there's more to be done, says Sol Mamakwa Duration 5:32 NDP MPP Sol Mamakwa called on Pope Francis to repudiate the 15th-century decrees known as the Doctrine of Discovery when the two met last summer. Mamakwa says the move is a positive step forward, with clear language recognizing the harm done to Indigenous people. He's calling on governments and other institutions to respect Indigenous land rights.   It's about time,  said Sol Mamakwa, an NDP member of the Ontario Legislature, an Anishinaabe and a member of Kingfisher Lake First Nation. He called the Doctrine of Discovery  one of the most racist, colonial systems that are there.    It's really, really important that we put this in action,  Mamakwa said, and one example would be to release all residential school records held by the Catholic Church and the federal government.  The Metis National Council said the Vatican's statement of repudiation signals  a renewed commitment by the Catholic Church to walking together in a good way.   The council said it is taking time to fully understand the statement's  nuances and potential implications, so that they can inform our collective next steps forward.   In June 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission -- which was formed as a means of reckoning with the devastating legacy of forced assimilation and abuse left by the residential school system in Canada -- issued its 94 calls to action. The 49th called on all faith groups to repudiate concepts used to justify European sovereignty over Indigenous lands and peoples.  Since then, many religious denominations and faith groups in Canada have done that.  Three papal bulls still in place  The Vatican offered no evidence that the three 15th-century papal bulls (Dum Diversas in 1452, Romanus Pontifex in 1455 and Inter Caetera in 1493) had themselves been formally abrogated, rescinded or rejected, as Vatican officials have often said. But it cited a subsequent bull, Sublimis Deus in 1537, that reaffirmed that Indigenous people shouldn't be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, and were not to be enslaved.  It was significant that the repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery came during the pontificate of history's first Latin American pope. Before his trip to Canada, the Argentinian-born Francis had apologized to Indigenous people in Bolivia in 2015 for the crimes of the colonial-era conquest of the Americas.  Cardinal Jose Tolentino de Mendonca, prefect of the Vatican's culture office, said the statement was a reflection of the Vatican's dialogue with Indigenous people.   This note is part of what we might call the architecture of reconciliation and also the product of the art of reconciliation, the process whereby people commit to listening to each other, to speaking to each other and to growth in mutual understanding,  he said in a statement.

It's a victory for Crystal Smith and her partner Raymond Shaw, who have been challenging British Columbia's Vital Statistics Agency to honour the Kwakwala characters in their baby son's name.  According to the provincial Ministry of Health,  going forward, the ability to claim names will be open to all Indigenous peoples  on birth certificates, regardless of age.  Smith says it's the start of what she hopes will become a wider movement of recognition. B.C. has the highest diversity of Indigenous languages in the country, with more than 34 languages and 90 dialects.  According to Smith, who is Ts'ymsen and Haisla, lugwal@s K'ala'ask Shaw's name means  the place where people are blessed  and comes from an origin story of Shaw's people, the Wei Wai Kum First Nation.   There were four brothers that were hunters, and they went to Loughborough Inlet,  Smith explained.   The older brother saw a one-horn mountain goat. He shot the mountain goat, but it didn't fall. He followed it to the cave, and when he went into the cave, he found a man. He was a spiritual being. The older brother ended up staying there for four days, and on the fourth day, the mountain goat said that he was going to give him gifts.''  Smith says the name lugwal@s is the place name for that mountain from the story, and the name given to the older brother for bringing gifts down from the mountain. The name is Kwakwaka'wakw, and uses phonetic symbols created by Kwakwala language keepers.  Birth certificate created barriers to health care, Smith says  When Smith and Shaw registered their son's birth, the Vital Statistics agency refused to accept the name, saying it would only accept names composed of Latin alphabetic letters, apostrophes, hyphens, periods and French accents.  The parents filed a challenge with the B.C. Supreme Court in 2022, arguing the agency's naming standards violate their constitutional rights.   The Kwakwala speakers worked really hard to create this written language and to change it because Vital Stats didn't agree or recognize it just felt disrespectful,'' Smith said.  Now that 14-month-old lugwal@s K'ala'ask Shaw has a birth certificate, Smith says she can stop worrying about accessing health care for her son.  At every medical appointment following his birth, her son was recognized only as  Baby Boy Shaw,  she said. Smith had to explain the situation to health-care providers during every postpartum visit, and when he had to go to the emergency room when he had COVID-19.  She said she was billed by the hospital for his birth because her son wasn't issued a birth certificate.   With all the harm that Canada has caused Indigenous people, and through that harm we were able to come up with a written language, they [Vital Statistics] should be upholding that,'' says Smith.  The case remains before the B.C. courts. According to Smith, Vital Statistics has six months to change their policies in exchange for an adjournment to scheduled hearings.  A statement from the provincial Ministry of Health says every Indigenous person in the province should be able to have their name accurately reflected on their documents, such as an ID or birth certificate.   Parents are able to register Indigenous names with a diacritical marker on a birth certificate with Vital Statistics. However, they must sign a waiver to understand the challenges that this may play for registering for government services,'' the statement said.   The waiver was made available to this family and going forward the ability to claim names will be open to all Indigenous peoples, not only new parents, older individuals as well.   Vital Statistics looks to adopt inclusive font  Vital Statistics says it is committed to implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People and the revitalization of Indigenous languages in B.C.  One of those actions is adopting an inclusive digital font that will allow for Indigenous languages to be included in official records, the agency's statement says, though it did not clarify a timeline or which symbols will be recognized.  Smith says having her son's birth certificate is something to be celebrated, but she won't be fulfilled until every Indigenous lifegiver has their chance to have their child's name accurately represented.   This was for all Indigenous mothers who want to name their children in their language, and to have their language respected,  she said.  She hopes her son's name will be the  ember  that sparks a fire leading to transformative change that honours Indigenous languages.  She says she doesn't consider the validation of her son's name as a step in the right direction because it's something that should have been done long ago.   I don't want Vital Statistics to use this as a pat on the back for reconciliation,  she said.  The next step for Smith and her family is to apply for her son's passport. Smith says she is looking forward to taking her son on cross-border canoe journeys.  In 2018, Smith complained to the B.C Human Rights Tribunal after she was evicted by her landlord for holding smudging ceremonies. The tribunal ruled in her favour and ordered the landlord to pay $23,000 in damages."}, {"source": "el-mundo", "title": "El Barcelona tiene facturas con la empresa del vicepresidente del Comite Tecnico de Arbitros desde 2001", "text": "El Barcelona pago al menos durante 17 anos por unos informes <<tecnicos>> a una empresa propiedad del ex vicepresidente del Comite Tecnico de Arbitros Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, y en la que su hijo Javier Enriquez Romero ejercia como administrador. Eso es lo que sostiene a EL MUNDO quien fuera presidente del club azulgrana, Josep Maria Bartomeu, despues de que la Cadena Ser avanzara este martes la investigacion abierta por la Fiscalia de Barcelona contra esta sociedad a raiz de una serie de irregularidades tributarias detectadas por la Agencia Tributaria entre 2016 y 2018. En ese intervalo de tiempo, la empresa DASNIL 95 SL cobro del Barcelona 1.685.142,8 euros.  Segun ha podido saber este diario, las diligencias, que fueron prorrogadas el pasado mes de octubre de 2022, se abrieron despues de una denuncia de un particular y continuan su curso. La Fiscalia, por ahora, solo investiga formalmente a la sociedad DASNIL 95, sin especificar por que tipo de delitos.  <<La primera factura que consta en el club es del ano 2001, con Joan Gaspart de presidente. Cuando Joan Laporta gano las elecciones en 2003 ya existia este servicio (el actual maximo mandatario dirigio el club en su primera etapa hasta 2010, cuando Sandro Rosell tomo el relevo). Me dijeron que no hay facturas anteriores a 2001. No habia por que guardarlas. Pero me han dicho que esto viene de la epoca de la presidencia de Josep Lluis Nunez>>, mantiene a este periodico Bartomeu.  Y Gaspart, que fue vicepresidente de Nunez durante 22 anos (1978-2000) para despues ocupar la poltrona entre julio de 2000 y febrero de 2003, dice desconocer el asunto. <<No tengo conocimiento en absoluto de que se hiciera algo incorrecto ni en mi epoca ni en la anterior. Si se encargaban informes sobre jugadores. Lo que no se a que empresa y quien era el dueno. El Barca, el Madrid y todos los equipos del mundo los piden. Pero niego rotundamente que se haya intentado coaccionar nunca a un arbitro. Y si lo hubieramos hecho, habriamos sido campeones de Liga eternamente>>, responde Gaspart a EL MUNDO.   Negreira no pintaba nada   Segun Bartomeu, la interlocucion durante su etapa se hizo siempre con Javier Enriquez, el hijo del ex vicepresidente del Comite Tecnico de Arbitros. <<A Javier lo conoci en 2015. Era el que hacia los informes. Pero quien trataba con el era el area deportiva. Yo no tenia reuniones ni con el hijo ni con el padre. No era un tema de presidencia ni de directivos. Pero los informes fisicos existen. Ademas, hay videos que hacia el propio Javier. Cogia los partidos y analizaba las jugadas donde hubiera algun acierto o error arbitral>>, prosigue Bartomeu, que niega que tratara con Enriquez Negreira cuestiones relacionadas con los arbitrajes: <<Yo a Negreira lo vi muchas veces en la Federacion Espanola (el ex arbitro de Primera entre 1977 y 1992 fue vicepresidente del Comite Tecnico de Arbitros desde 1994 hasta 2018). Pero nunca hable nada con el de arbitrajes. De hecho, nunca hable con ningun arbitro sobre temas de arbitraje. !Prohibido! Ademas, creo que Negreira no pintaba nada>>.  Bartomeu y otros ex ejecutivos del Barcelona han prestado declaracion ante Fiscalia. Tambien lo han hecho Enriquez Negreira y su hijo, que consta como administrador unico de la empresa entre 2004 y 2019. Si bien Javier Enriquez facilito informes tecnicos, su padre declaro que estos se comunicaban verbalmente. Algo que niega el propio Bartomeu: <<El hijo aporto los trabajos que hizo, pero el padre dijo que les pagaron 'por no hacer nada'. No se por que. Y esos informes seguro que estan en el club. O, si no, en el despacho de Javier Enriquez o en Fiscalia>>.  En junio de 2018, el Barcelona pago la ultima factura a DASNIL 95. La interrupcion de la vinculacion comercial coincidio con la salida de Enriquez Negreira del Comite Tecnico de Arbitros. <<Pep Segura, que era nuestro director deportivo, y Oscar Grau [quien fuera CEO del club azulgrana] decidieron reducir algunos gastos del area deportiva. Y este fue uno de ellos. Se anulo ese servicio externo para que pasara a ser interno. Se hizo para ahorrar dinero>>, argumenta Bartomeu, que insiste en que este tipo de informes arbitrales <<son necesarios e imprescindibles para todos los grandes clubes>>. <<Todo el mundo los tiene y es normal>>, abunda. Segun antiguos ejecutivos de la entidad, en dichos informes podian incluirse pautas de comportamiento ante los arbitros.  El Barcelona, mientras, admitio ayer los servicios contratados a un <<consultor externo>> para que suministrara, primero, <<informes tecnicos referidos a jugadores de categorias inferiores>>, y despues <<informes tecnicos relacionados con el arbitraje profesional a fin de complementar informacion requerida por el cuerpo tecnico>>."}, {"source": "der-tagesspiegel", "title": "Mehr Religionsunterricht, weniger Prufungen: Das planen CDU und SPD fur Berlins Schulen und Kitas", "text": "Tagesspiegel Plus Exklusiv Mehr Religionsunterricht, weniger Prufungen : Das planen CDU und SPD fur Berlins Schulen und Kitas  Schwarz-Rot hat sich in einem 14-seitigen Papier darauf geeinigt, wichtige Weichen im Bereich Schule und Kitas neu zu stellen.

Irene Montero replica a Feijoo:  El aborto si es un derecho   La ministra de Igualdad, Irene Montero, toma oxigeno con una aprobacion tan rotunda de su ley del aborto en medio de la crisis de desgaste que esta sufriendo con las rebajas de condenas a agresores sexuales por la ley del solo si es si, que van camino de las 550. No ha querido aludir a ese asunto explicitamente pero si lo ha hecho de manera indirecta para intentar apuntalar su tesis de que todo lo que esta ocurriendo con la ley de libertad sexual es consecuencia de las  resistencias  de los sectores reaccionarios a aplicar de manera correcta la leyes feministas.  De este modo, Montero ha advertido de que con la ley del aborto va a pasar lo mismo:  Va a haber resistencia a la aplicacion de la ley igual que habra a todas las leyes feministas , ha dicho, para anadir que ahora  toca trabajar mucho con las comunidades autonomas, los centros sanitarios o las administraciones competentes para que haya personal suficiente para practicar los abortos o permitir la educacion sexual en todas las escuelas y ser capaces de  cumplir la ley a pesar de las resistencias .  Por lo demas, la ministra ha celebrado la culminacion del proyecto y la fuerza de la mayoria feminista del Congreso:  Aborto seguro y en la publica para no morir, anticonceptivos para no abortar y educacion sexual integral para decidir, ser libres y ser felices .   Impostura electoralista   Por su parte, el PSOE ha aprovechado el debate para hurgar en el debate interno en el PP sobre el aborto y para cargar contra el partido por el  espectaculo  que esta dando sobre si lo considera un derecho o no.  Senores del PP, no enganan a nadie porque han tenido recurrida la ley del aborto 13 anos , ha criticado Laura Berja, que ha tachado de  impostura electoralista  el nuevo discurso de los populares. Por lo demas, y en plena guerra interna con Unidas Podemos por la ley del solo si es si, la diputada andaluza ha reivindicado a su partido.  El PSOE ha sido el soporte politico de la estructura juridica de los derechos de las mujeres en este pais y, si, lo sigue siendo , ha sentenciado.  El PP ha justificado su rechazo al proyecto de ley por ser  inoportuno ,  innecesario ,  infantilizador ,  intolerante  e  incongruente . Entre otras cuestiones Marta Gonzalez ha senalado la oposicion del partido a que las jovenes de 16 y 17 anos puedan abortar sin el permiso de sus padres o que la nueva normativa vaya a eliminar la obligatoriedad de entregar informacion a las mujeres que quieren interrumpir el embarazo. Ademas, la diputada popular ha avisado de los riesgos que hay cuando este Ministerio de Igualdad toca una ley por  la probabilidad de que el desastre se extienda . Motivo por el cual ha invitado a Montero a dimitir por las consecuencias de la ley del solo si es si.  Mientras el PSOE, Unidas Podemos, ERC o Mas Pais han arremetido por la izquierda contra el PP por volver a oponerse a una ley del aborto, desde su derecha ha recibido tambien la descarga de artilleria de Vox por haberse sometido  sumisamente  a los postulados de la izquierda y por ser el  responsable directo  de no haber derogado la ley de 2010 y haber contribuido al cambio de mentalidad sobre esa norma. Ahora, ha incidido Lourdes Mendez Monasterio, Feijoo  consuma su traicion  por aceptar lo que Vox tacha de ser  la maxima expresion de la barbarie .  En cuanto al contenido, la nueva ley establece garantias para que los abortos se puedan practicar en la sanidad publica en toda Espana y obliga que haya personal disponible para hacerlo en todos los hospitales. Ademas, hace una regulacion de la objecion de conciencia del personal sanitario, al espejo de la que ya se puso en marcha con la aprobacion de la eutanasia. Tambien se cambian protocolos como la eliminacion de los tres dias de reflexion.  Mas alla del tema del aborto, la ley establece medidas sobre maternidad, como una baja preparto para las madres a partir de la semana 39 de gestacion, o sobre salud sexual, como el reparto gratuito de la pildora del dia despues, educacion sexual en los centros escolares o las bajas laborales por menstruaciones con dolor incapacitante.  Estas son las claves de la nueva ley:  ABORTO  Las mujeres de 16 y 17 anos podran interrumpir voluntariamente su embarazo sin necesidad de contar con el permiso de sus padres . Se recupera lo que establecia la ley de plazos aprobada por Zapatero en 2010 y que Rajoy cambio en 2015 solo en este punto para exigir autorizacion paterna a las menores.  .

April lauft fur die Bundesregierung eine Frist fur eine mogliche Klage gegen ein ungarisches Gesetz zur Einschrankung von Informationen uber Homo- und Transsexualitat ab. Nach der Meinung des Vorsitzenden des Europaausschusses im Bundestag, Anton Hofreiter (Grune), sollte die Bundesregierung diese Frist nicht ungenutzt verstreichen lassen. Die EU-Kommission hatte im vergangenen Jahr gegen das Gesetz geklagt.  Seit Juli 2021 sind in Ungarn Publikationen, die nicht heterosexuelle Beziehungen darstellen, verboten, wenn sie Kindern zuganglich sind. Die EU-Kommission hatte ihre Klage damit begrundet, dass das Gesetz der nationalkonservativen Regierung in Budapest einer Diskriminierung von Minderheiten auf Grundlage ihrer sexuellen Orientierung und Geschlechtsidentitat gleichkomme. EU-Kommissionschefin Ursula von der Leyen sprach seinerzeit von einer ,,Schande .  Umstrittenes Gesetz 2021 wurde im ungarischen Parlament ein Gesetz verabschiedet, das die Informationsmoglichkeiten von Jugendlichen in Hinblick auf Homosexualitat und Transsexualitat einschrankt. Anschliessend reichte die EU-Kommission eine Klage gegen das Gesetz ein. Ungarns Regierungschef Viktor Orban wies die Kritik an dem Gesetz mit der Begrundung zuruck, dass nur Ungarn daruber entscheiden konne, wie Kinder in dem Land erzogen wurden.  Inzwischen haben sich neun EU-Mitgliedstaaten der Klage der Brusseler Behorde angeschlossen: Osterreich, Belgien, Danemark, Irland, Luxemburg, Malta, die Niederlande, Portugal und Spanien. Auch der Rechtsausschuss des Europaparlaments sprach sich zuletzt mehrheitlich dafur aus, die Klage gegen das Gesetz des ungarischen Regierungschefs Viktor Orban vor dem Europaischen Gerichtshof (EuGH) zu unterstutzen.  ,,Es ist gut, dass die EU-Kommission gegen Ungarns Anti-LGBTIQ-Gesetz klagt , sagte Hofreiter dem Tagesspiegel. ,,Es ware ein wichtiges Zeichen, wenn sich Deutschland anderen europaischen Staaten anschliesst und der Klage beitritt , sagte der Grunen-Politiker weiter. ,,Die Bundesregierung darf die Frist zum Klagebeitritt nicht verstreichen lassen .  Hofreiter begrundete seine Forderung damit, dass Ungarn seit Jahren europaisches Recht und europaische Werte missachte. ,,Das darf nicht ohne Konsequenzen bleiben , forderte er. Europa konne nur dann stark nach aussen agieren, ,,wenn es seine Werte nach innen wahrt .  Nach Informationen des Tagesspiegels befurwortet es das Auswartige Amt, dass sich Deutschland einer Klage gegen das ungarische Anti-LGBTIQ-Gesetz anschliesst.

The commissioners also turned their eye to how an  epidemic  of domestic violence played a role in the rampage.  After listening to seven months of witness testimony and reviewing thousands of pages of documents, the Mass Casualty Commission released its final, sprawling report Thursday with 130 recommendations across more than 3,000 pages.  The report took aim at the RCMP's response to the crisis, on almost every level. It called out a lack of preparation, a lack of communication and a lack of leadership -- issues so pertinent and prevalent the commissioners are calling for a rethink of how the entire force operates.   More than two years after the event, RCMP leadership had done very little to systematically evaluate its critical incident response to the deadliest mass shooting in Canada's history,  noted the commissioners in the report.   In our process, it was apparent that the organizational structure of the RCMP both contributes to these failings and makes it challenging to hold the organization accountable for its work.   Twenty-two people died on April 18 and 19, 2020. Top row from left: Gina Goulet, Dawn Gulenchyn, Jolene Oliver, Frank Gulenchyn, Sean McLeod, Alanna Jenkins. Second row: John Zahl, Lisa McCully, Joey Webber, Heidi Stevenson, Heather O'Brien and Jamie Blair. Third row from top: Kristen Beaton, Lillian Campbell, Joanne Thomas, Peter Bond, Tom Bagley and Greg Blair. Bottom row: Emily Tuck, Joy Bond, Corrie Ellison and Aaron Tuck. (CBC)  The RCMP was woefully unprepared to handle the events of April 18 and 19, 2020, according to the report, despite previous recommendations out of past tragedies.  The responding detachment in Bible Hill, N.S., didn't have an emergency operational plan, despite national guidelines following the Parliament Hill shooting in 2014. The plans are meant to prepare the force ahead of a crisis so roles and responsibilities are understood in advance.  Mounties on the ground also weren't aware of plans that were supposed to be in place.  For example, following the shooting in Moncton, N.B, that killed three Mounties in 2014, recommendations were made to establish an emergency operational plan that identified major transport routes and critical locations to stop or contain an active threat from moving across the province.  Victims' families react to Portapique inquiry report Duration 1:44 Family members spoke after the Mass Casualty Commission released its final report nearly three years after 22 people were killed across Nova Scotia.   However, those in command of the critical incident response of April 18 and 19, 2020, were unaware of the existence of this plan, and it was not used during the mass casualty,  said Thursday's report.  It also said information gleaned by 911 call-takers in the RCMP Operational Communications Centre was incomplete and not always passed along.  The lack of preparedness caused chaos and confusion on the ground with the responding officers unclear of the command structure.  The report also criticized how the RCMP failed to grasp that the gunman was driving an authentic-looking replica police car, despite being told by multiple witnesses.  RCMP failed to warn community of danger: report  Some of the harshest condemnation issued by commissioners was saved for the RCMP's decision to withhold information from the public. That included that the gunman had left Portapique -- the rural area where his rampage began -- and that he was disguised as a police officer and was driving across the province in that replica vehicle.   The RCMP's failure ... deprived community members of the opportunity to evaluate risks to their safety and to take measures to better protect themselves,  wrote the commissioners.  Some victims' families, especially those who were killed on the morning of April 19, have been vocal that they believe their loved ones would still be alive if the RCMP had broadcast public warnings.  The families of Kristen Beaton and Heather O'Brien told the commission that if the two women had known the perpetrator had left Portapique and was disguised as a police officer, they would have stayed home that morning.  The family of Gina Goulet also told the commission that if she had known about the gunman on the loose, she could have sought safety with family or neighbours.  The force also used tweets to communicate with the public during their hunt for the gunman instead of broadcasting a warning using the Canadian emergency alerting system.  Cpl. Lisa Croteau sent this tweet on April 18, 2020. It was the RCMP's first public mention of a situation in Portapique, N.S. It was the only communication sent out publicly until the morning of April 19. (Twitter)  There was immediate pushback after the shootings from people who pointed out the challenges of internet access in rural parts of the province and that the vast majority of residents would not have used Twitter -- views reflected by the commissioners in their report.  They wrote that the first tweet sent at 11:32 p.m., which simply referred to a  firearms complaint,  underplayed the seriousness of the threat to the public.   The RCMP conveyed accurate info to the public in a timely manner in Moncton in 2014, the same cannot be said of the RCMP's use of social media in Nova Scotia in 2020,  said the report.  The gunman's replica RCMP cruiser that was used in the Nova Scotia mass shooting was created with a decommissioned 2017 Ford Taurus. (Mass Casualty Commission)  In the report, the commission said the lack of public warning is  symptomatic of an institutional culture that undervalues community relationships and public communications.   During the inquiry, the commission heard from several RCMP members who said that sharing information quickly and widely during an incident like a mass shooting could incite panic and put their officers in danger.  The report said those points are  myths  that have no legitimate place in police decision-making about warning the public about an active threat.  Report calls for a review of RCMP model  The commissioners say the RCMP is in need of a fundamental change, noting there have been other commissions and reports in the past that have unsuccessfully called for reform.   Past inquiries have concluded that these problems create a toxic workplace culture within the RCMP. We find that they also impede the RCMP's operational effectiveness.   Out of 130 recommendations in the report, more than half are aimed at the RCMP and policing culture.  One of the defining recommendations calls for the federal public safety minister to commission an independent review of the RCMP and to examine the force's approach to contract policing and work with contract partners, such as the province of Nova Scotia.  'There need to be changes': Trudeau reacts to Mass Casualty Commission Report in Nova Scotia Duration 0:58 Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Truro, N.S. for the presentation of the report on the April 2020 mass shooting in Nova Scotia. He says he will take time to absorb the details of the report and implement its recommendations.  The report also recommends that:  The RCMP adopt a policy of admitting its mistakes, accepting responsibility for them, and ensuring that accountability mechanisms are in place for addressing its errors.  The demonstrated capacity to accept responsibility for one's errors should be a criterion for any promotion within the RCMP.  The RCMP phase out the Depot model of RCMP training by 2032 and Public Safety Canada work with provinces and territories to establish a three-year degree-based model of police education for all police services in Canada.  A number of the recommendations also touch on how the RCMP in Nova Scotia responded, including implementing emergency plans, sharing the best available information of a threat to the public as soon as possible and establishing clear protocols for unified command posts.  Other policing recommendations include that:  The RCMP's national communications policies should be revised to state clearly that the objective of the RCMP's public communications is to provide accurate information about the RCMP's operations, and in particular to respond to media questions in a timely and complete manner.  The RCMP and Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office should review call-taker recruitment and training to ensure that 911 call-takers are trained to capture all information shared by a community member as fully and accurately as possible, and to listen for background noises or information that may also be important for first responders.  Within 90 days of a mass casualty incident occurring, the RCMP should initiate an after-action review to be conducted by an arm's-length reviewer.  The province of Nova Scotia should ensure that specialized policing services are adequate, effective, and efficiently organized to meet the demand throughout Nova Scotia, whether by contract with RCMP or by other means.  The RCMP should work with the RCMP Veterans Association to ask retired members to return items in their personal possession, including badges that have not been encased in plastic and uniforms.  Funds needed to address intimate-partner violence  The commission wrote that while no one could have predicted the gunman's specific actions to take the lives of 22 people, his  pattern and escalation of violence could and should have been addressed.   They said many red flags about his violent and illegal behaviour toward his long-time partner Lisa Banfield, his family members and patients in his practice as a denturist were known by a range of people, and had been brought to authorities over a number of years.  Lisa Banfield, the common-law wife of Gabriel Wortman, testifies at the Mass Casualty Commission inquiry into the mass murders in rural Nova Scotia on April 18-19, 2020, in Halifax in July 2022. Wortman, dressed as an RCMP officer and driving a replica police cruiser, murdered 22 people. (The Canadian Press/Andrew Vaughan)  A main finding was that this pattern was facilitated by the power and privilege he experienced as a wealthy white man with professional status.   Gender-based, intimate partner, and family violence is an epidemic. Like the COVID-19 pandemic, it is a public health emergency that warrants a meaningful, whole of society response,  the report said.  Better response, aftermath support needed  The report supports testimony from the victims' families that the services offered by the RCMP and Nova Scotia Victim Services were not enough.  Families have regularly spoken about how the one officer assigned to handle the loved ones of 21 victims was overwhelmed and unable to properly help or share information equally. The family of the one RCMP officer who was killed, Const. Heidi Stevenson, had their own liaison officer.  The report recommends the federal government start a resource hub by September 2023 which would be a  centre of expertise  for victims and their families and have the RCMP update its policies on family liaison officers and next of kin notifications.  Other recommendations include a dedicated telephone line for individuals seeking information about family or friends, and a website. The time standard for mobilizing the victim-management plan should be 90 minutes from the time a critical incident response is activated.  Gun control, Alert Ready changes  The report also discusses the need for changes around firearm possession and the cross-border smuggling of guns and ammunition into Canada.  The commissioners wrote that the issue is influenced by the United States discourse centred on a right to bear arms  which does not exist in our constitutional and legal structure.   The commission recommends the Criminal Code be changed to prohibit all semi-automatic handguns, semi-automatic rifles, and shotguns that discharge centre-fire ammunition and are designed to accept detachable magazines with capacities of more than five rounds; and ban the use of a magazine with more than five rounds.  After police shot and killed the gunman at a gas station in Enfield, N.S., they found five firearms in his possession, three handguns and two rifles. He obtained three of them in Houlton, Maine. (Mass Casualty Commission)  The report also sided with critics of the national public emergency alert system, Alert Ready.  The commissioners wrote that responsibility for alerting the public must be shifted away from a private provider. Currently, the Ontario-based company Pelmorex owns Canada's Alert Ready software system and operates it on behalf of the federal government.  The commissioners recommend that all levels of government should conduct a review of public alerting to determine how the Alert Ready system can be reformed to meet the legal responsibility to warn people of emergencies.  The inquiry was mandated jointly by the province and by Ottawa and is expected to cost around $47 million in funding from the two levels of government.  The commissioners end their report with a plea to police, government and Canadians to heed their recommendations, dedicating 82 pages on how to implement their findings and a tracking system for accountability.   We recognize that the extensive agenda is daunting,  they wrote.  But we emphasize that inaction is also a form of action and that spectatorship is an inadequate response.

Sie geniesst eine gewisse Prominenz, das schon, hat ihren Job in der Vergangenheit allerdings meist gerauschlos erledigt und die jeweils kunftigen Kurator:innen der wichtigen Megaschau bestimmt. Diesmal ist alles anders; diesmal ruhen zahllose Augen auf der israelischen Malerin und Theoretikerin Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, der in Schanghai lebenden Kuratorin Gong Yan, Ranjit Hoskote aus Mumbai, Simon Njami, Maria Ines Rodriguez und Kathrin Rhomberg, die unter anderem den Kolnischen Kunstverein geleitet hat. Denn das neue Team soll nicht bloss in die Zukunft der Documenta 16 im Jahr 2027 denken. Es soll auch hinter sich aufraumen.  Dabei hat es den Schaden, den im vergangenen Jahr vor allem das monumentale Werk des indonesischen Kunstlerkollektivs Taring Padi mit seinen antisemitischen Motiven anrichteten, gar nicht verursacht. Doch allein der Gedanke, die kommende Documenta liesse sich losgelost von jenem Skandal realisieren, weil funf Jahre Zeit dazwischen liegen, ware irrwitzig. Es wird im Gegenteil voraussichtlich noch einmal alles hochgespult, wenn in Kassel 2027 das nachste kulturellen Grossereignis namens Documenta ansteht.  Christiane Meixner ist die Kunst-Markt-Expertin des Tagesspiegels.  Katastrophal war im vergangenen Jahr - neben dem enttauschend laxen Umgang von Taring Padi mit den Vorwurfen - auch die Kommunikation von Seiten der Organisatoren. Erst wurde kollektiv geschwiegen, dann ging die Generaldirektorin der Documenta, Sabine Schormann, mit widerspruchlichen Behauptungen in den Modus der Verteidigung - bis sie abtreten musste. Das soll sich offenbar nicht wiederholen. Diesmal zahlt mehr Transparenz.  ,,Wir haben sechs herausragende Expertinnen und Experten aus aller Welt gewinnen konnen, die sowohl mit ihren unterschiedlichen kunstlerischen, kuratorischen und kulturtheoretischen Hintergrunden als auch als Personlichkeiten gemeinsam fur die Modernitat, die Internationalitat und die Vielfalt der Documenta stehen , heisst es im Statement des Kasseler Oberburgermeisters Christian Geselle und der hessischen Ministerin fur Wissenschaft und Kunst, Angela Dorn, die beide dem Aufsichtsrat vorsitzen.  Nun gehe es darum, die ,,Verfehlungen beim Thema Antisemitismus  auf der vom indonesischen Kollektiv Ruangrupa verantworteten Documenta 15 aufzuarbeiten.

Der Wettbewerb um die Entwicklung von Kunstlicher Intelligenz (KI) sei ausser Kontrolle geraten. Das Netz konnte mit Fake News und Propaganda geflutet, sogar erfullende Jobs wegrationalisiert werden. Wir konnten die Kontrolle uber unsere Zivilisation verlieren. Es brauche mehr Regulierung.  Wenn Unternehmer und KI-Experten eine derartige Dystopie heraufbeschworen, ist das einerseits kontraproduktiv. Angst sollte die Debatte uber Kunstliche Intelligenz nicht bestimmen. Im Vordergrund sollte die Vision stehen: Wie KI uns produktiver und unser Leben besser machen kann.  Naivitat ist fehl am Platz  Gleichzeitig haben sie Recht. Naivitat ist fehl am Platz. Die Veranderungen, die durch Kunstliche Intelligenz auf uns zukommen, werden so umfassend sein, dass wir sie jetzt noch gar nicht ermessen konnen. Deswegen ist die Forderung nach Regulierung absolut richtig.  ChatGPT ist ein Weckruf. Das System, das im vergangenen November vorgestellt wurde, machte Schlagzeilen, weil es Texte produzieren kann, die sich lesen, als waren sie von einem Menschen geschrieben. Langst lost ChatGPT auch Medizin-Examen, kann in Sekunden eine funktionierende Website programmieren oder eine Klageschrift verfassen. Zwischen den grossen Technologie-Unternehmen Google und Microsoft ist ein Wettlauf um die Vorherrschaft bei Kunstlicher Intelligenz ausgebrochen. Auch China versucht mit allen Mitteln aufzuholen.  Doch nach welchen moralischen Standards soll Kunstliche Intelligenz agieren? Welche Aufgaben darf sie erfullen, welche nicht? Wie wird verhindert, dass sie lugt, Straftaten begeht oder komplett auf eigene Faust handelt? Welche ungewollten gesellschaftlichen Auswirkungen durch Kunstliche Intelligenz mussen verhindert werden? Ist es akzeptabel, dass Menschen Fahigkeiten verlieren, wenn diese kunftig von einer KI ubernommen werden? Die Antworten auf diese Fragen durfen nicht privaten Unternehmen mit wirtschaftlichen Interessen uberlassen werden. Auch sollten sich Unternehmen nicht selbst kontrollieren.  Dass Handlungsbedarf besteht, hat die Politik bereits seit Langerem verstanden. Auf EU-Ebene gibt es eine KI-Strategie. Es ist eine KI-Verordnung in Planung. Doch bis diese in Kraft tritt, konnten noch Jahre vergehen. So ist sogar die Definition von KI noch strittig. Oder die Frage, welche Arten von KI als risikobehaftet gelten sollen.  Es gibt in der Politik Bedenken, zu stark einzugreifen und damit Innovation abzuwurgen. Digitalminister Volker Wissing warnte nach einem Besuch bei Open AI, dem Entwickler von Chat GPT, vor uberzogener Regulierung. Und das, obwohl er bereits die neueste, noch leistungsstarkere Version GPT4 bestaunen durfte.  Politik kann derzeit nicht mithalten  Die Debatte ist bereits jetzt kleinteilig und die Geschwindigkeit von Politik uberhaupt nicht in der Lage, mit der sich stark beschleunigenden Entwicklung hochkomplexer KI-Systeme mitzuhalten. In dem offenen Brief warnen KI-Experten davor, dass nicht einmal die Entwickler dieser Systeme sie noch verstehen oder verlasslich kontrollieren konnten.  Die Regulierung sollten nicht einzelne Staaten fur sich klaren, auch die EU-Ebene greift zu kurz. Es handelt sich um nicht weniger als eine Menschheitsaufgabe. Und diese muss international gelost werden. Es ist unrealistisch, die KI-Entwickler zunachst zu einer selbst auferlegten Pause zu bewegen - der Wettbewerbsdruck ist zu gross. Deshalb muss die Staatengemeinschaft zugig handeln.  Ein angemessener Ausgangspunkt konnte eine internationale Konferenz sein, zu der Experten, Politiker und Unternehmen aus der ganzen Welt eingeladen sind. Dabei sollte es nicht um kleinteilige Regulierung gehen, sondern tatsachlich um die grossen Fragen. Sicher kann so ein Format nicht auf einen Schlag alle Probleme losen. Doch nach der Vorstellung der neuesten Version von ChatGPT ist es notiger denn je. Kunstliche Intelligenz braucht Grenzen. Nur dann kann sie die Welt zum Besseren verandern.

Die Anwesenheit von US-Amerikanern in Russland sei zutiefst besorgniserregend, sagte der Kommunikationsdirektor des Weissen Hauses, John Kirby, am Donnerstag.  Von der Festnahme des US-Reporters Evan Gershkovich und den Vorwurfen gegen ihn sei man uberrascht worden. Es habe keine Vorwarnung gegeben und auch keine Anzeichen dafur, dass Russland eine Art grossere Aktion gegen Journalisten im Allgemeinen plane, sagte Kirby weiter. Es sei nun noch zu fruh zu sagen, ob dies der Fall sei.  Das US-Aussenministerium rat Burgerinnen und Burgern der USA bereits von Reisen nach Russland ab - auch wegen des Risikos unrechtmassiger Inhaftierungen. Es sei nicht neu fur Russland, US-Amerikaner festzuhalten oder gegen eine freie und unabhangige Presse vorzugehen, sagte Kirby.  Haftbefehl wegen angeblicher Spionage  Es klingt wie der Beginn eines Agententhrillers aus der Zeit des Kalten Krieges - und scheint jedoch schlicht eine weitere Provokation Russlands in einer ohnehin schon angespannten Weltlage zu sein. Es geht um Rustungsspionage, einen festgenommenen Spitzel - und zwei sich gegenuberstehende Supermachte.  Am Donnerstag hat ein Gericht in Moskau Haftbefehl gegen Evan Gershkovich, einen Reporter der renommierten US-amerikanischen Zeitung ,,Wall Street Journal , wegen angeblicher Spionage erlassen. Zuvor war er in Jekaterinburg im Ural festgenommen worden. Das hatte die russische Nachrichtenagentur Tass gemeldet und sich dabei auf den russischen Geheimdienst FSB bezogen.  Dieser hatte Gershkovich ,,Spionage im Interesse der amerikanischen Regierung  vorgeworfen, angeblich soll er fur die USA Informationen uber den militarisch-industriellen Komplex in Russland gesammelt haben. Am Donnerstagnachmittag hiess es aus dem Kreml, dass die Vorwurfe gegen Gershkovic bewiesen seien. ,,Soweit uns bekannt ist, wurde er auf frischer Tat ertappt , sagte Kremlsprecher Dmitri Peskow im staatlichen Rundfunk. Bis zum 29. Mai soll Gershkovich in Untersuchungshaft bleiben, sollte er verurteilt werden, drohen ihm bis zu 20 Jahre Haft.  Das ,,Wall Street Journal  widerspricht den Vorwurfen heftig  Soweit die Vorwurfe von russischer Seite, denen Gershkovichs Arbeitgeber heftig widersprach. ,,Das Wall Street Journal weist die Anschuldigungen des FSB vehement zuruck und fordert die sofortige Freilassung unseres vertrauenswurdigen und engagierten Reporters , hiess es in einem Statement der Zeitung. ,,Wir stehen in Solidaritat mit Evan und seiner Familie.   Gershkovich berichtet fur die Zeitung aus Russland, er ist als Journalist auch beim russischen Aussenministerium akkreditiert. Zuletzt hatte uber die Soldnertruppe Wagner recherchiert, die derzeit auch in der Ukraine auf russischer Seite kampft. Konkret soll es um die Einstellung der Bevolkerung zu den Anwerbeversuchen der Privatarmee gegangen sein.  Evan Gershkovich arbeitet fur das ,,Wall Street Journal  in Russland. (c) AFP/Dimitar Dilkoff  Doch was steht hinter Gershkovichs Festnahme? Der Fall erinnert an den der Basketballspielerin Brittney Griner, die im Februar 2022 am Flughafen in Moskau verhaftet wurde, weil in ihrem Handgepack geringe Mengen Haschischol gefunden worden waren. Sie wurde anschliessend zu neun Jahren Haft verurteilt. Die US-Regierung verhandelte mit Russland uber ihre Freilassung, es kam zu einem Gefangenenaustausch, Griner kam im Dezember 2022 frei.  Wir sind alarmiert uber diesen Versuch, Medienschaffende einzuschuchtern! Reporter ohne Grenzen  Hat es Russland also auch in diesem Fall wieder nur auf ein Tauschgeschaft abgesehen? ,,Letztlich werden die USA nicht umhinkommen, uber den Austausch mit den russischen Behorden zu verhandeln , sagt Gerhard Mangott, Professor fur Politikwissenschaft mit den Schwerpunkten Internationale Beziehungen und Sicherheit im postsowjetischen Raum an der Universitat Innsbruck, dem Tagesspiegel.  Zwei Ziele verfolge Moskau mit der Festnahme. ,,Zum einen sollen westliche Journalisten in den Augen der russischen Bevolkerung diskreditiert werden. Zum anderen aber dienen solche Festnahmen dazu, ,Geiseln' zu bekommen, die dann gegen im Westen gefangen genommene russische Spione ausgetauscht werden sollen , sagte Mangott.  US-Amerikaner werden in Russland immer wieder der Spionage verdachtigt, im Zuge des Ukraine-Krieges ist die Situation fur sie noch prekarer geworden. Dass jedoch ein akkreditierter Journalist nun Gefahr lauft, bis zu 20 Jahre in einem russischen Gefangnis zu verbringen, ist ein neuer Tiefpunkt im russisch-amerikanischen Verhaltnis. ,,Die Festnahme Gershkovichs wird die ohnehin eingefrorenen Beziehungen zwischen beiden Landern noch zusatzlich belasten , sagte Gerhard Mangott.  Gershkovichs Festnahme hatte am Donnerstag weltweit fur Emporung gesorgt. ,,Wir sind alarmiert uber diesen Versuch, Medienschaffende einzuschuchtern! , twitterte zum Beispiel die international tatige Nichtregierungsorganisation Reporter ohne Grenzen. Auch Journalisten anderer Medien verurteilten die Festnahme scharf.  Weisses Haus ,,zutiefst besorgt   Neben ihrem Appell an die amerikanische Bevolkerung, Russland schnellstmoglich zu verlassen, hat die US-Regierung die Inhaftierung Gershkovichs ,,aufs Scharfste  verurteilt. ,,Die Verfolgung amerikanischer Staatsburger durch die russische Regierung ist inakzeptabel , teilte das Weisse Haus am Donnerstag mit. ,,Wir sind zutiefst besorgt uber die beunruhigenden Berichte, dass Evan Gershkovich, ein amerikanischer Staatsburger, in Russland festgenommen wurde.  Das US-Aussenministerium stehe in direktem Kontakt mit der russischen Regierung und bemuhe sich aktiv darum, Gershkovich konsularischen Zugang zu verschaffen.  Am Mittwochabend (Ortszeit) hatten Vertreter der US-Regierung mit dem Arbeitgeber Gershkovichs, dem ,,Wall Street Journal  gesprochen. Man stehe auch in Kontakt mit der Familie des Journalisten. ,,Wir verurteilen auch die fortgesetzte Verfolgung und Unterdruckung von Journalisten und der Pressefreiheit durch die russische Regierung , teilte das Weisse Haus weiter mit.  Kremlsprecher Peskow hofft derweil auf Einsicht von amerikanischer Seite und dass es nun nicht Repressionen gegen russische Journalisten in den USA gebe. Schliesslich gehe es bei Gershkovich nicht bloss um einen Verdacht. Er sei auf frischer Tat ertappt worden.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for Wednesday's episode of Survivor,  The Third Turd.   One moment can change everything. It happens in life, and it happens in the game of Survivor. Both happened simultaneously on day 2 of Survivor 44 for Matthew Grinstead-Mayle. While climbing a large rock to explore the area, Matthew's foot slipped and he tumbled down onto the rocky shore.  It was a scary moment, one that replayed numerous times over several weeks as Matthew's injury continued to play a major storyline in the season. But while the footage, which was shot by a drone camera hovering above the action, is hard to watch, it's also visually stunning.  In fact, Jeff Probst says that footage might say more about the Survivor experience than any other in the franchise.  In many ways, that drone shot represents Survivor about as well as any shot could,  the host tells EW.  You get a great feel for the adventure of Survivor when Matthew makes the decision to climb the rock. You see the cinematic beauty of Survivor through our drone team's quick reaction to get up in the air and capture the dramatic moment. You feel the realness of the risks that come with living in a Fijian jungle. And you are reminded that every decision you make on Survivor comes with a consequence. Sometimes the results favor you, and sometimes they do you in.   'Survivor' host Jeff Probst 'Survivor' host Jeff Probst | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  Still, watching a person fall in such a ghastly and gruesome matter -- even if it only resulted in a shoulder injury and some cuts and bruises -- is, in many ways, scarier than the far more explicit carnage you'll see on scripted shows like The Walking Dead, House of The Dragon, and The Last of Us. What's real frightens in a different way than fiction.  With that in mind, did the producers and CBS ever consider not airing the footage due to its grisly content?  No, we were never concerned about airing it,  says Probst.  Injuries are not common on Survivor, but they do happen, and we owe it to the players to represent their experience as authentically as they lived the experience.   Unfortunately for Matthew, his injury caused him so much pain and agony that he walked away from the game this week after being medically evaluated once again by the Survivor medical team. We asked Probst about the circumstances surrounding Matthew's departure, and what it was like to share with the Tika tribe that they no longer had to vote anyone out.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: We saw Matthew examined by the doctor after the Immunity Challenge. He had to make a really tough decision on whether or not to continue in the game with all that pain. When and where did that decision get made?  JEFF PROBST: After the challenge, we sent the rest of the tribe back to camp so that Dr. Will could do a thorough examination of Matthew's shoulder and talk with him in private. Dr. Will spent quite a bit of time not only looking at the shoulder, but also discussing the long-term risks associated with this type of injury. It was clear to me that Matthew was torn on whether to stay or go. He had been in the Survivor casting mix for years and prepared so hard for his opportunity, but he kept coming back to the impact it could have on his family and career. The longer we talked, the more Matthew began to realize that he didn't feel comfortable risking additional injury to his shoulder.  Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  How concerned were you with Matthew continuing on in a very tough, physical game, knowing that this was a person who was really going to try to push himself to the absolute limit?  From day one, when Matthew climbed up and subsequently fell off that giant rock, it was clear he only had one speed: full tilt. We were also torn, because while we were very concerned that he would continue to take risks in order to help his tribe, we also knew how much he wanted this adventure. So there was a mixture of sadness and relief when he made the decision to leave the game.  Matthew played all-out. Give us your impressions as a host and EP in terms of what he brought to the game.  Matthew is everything you hope for in a Survivor player. This is why we spend so much time in casting trying to find the right group of players. You want someone who will show up and give 100% every single day. You want someone who knows the game and will play the game. You want someone who will be vulnerable. And you want someone who will be their most authentic self while doing it. Matthew embodies all of that. We loved having him on the show and we hated losing him.  What was the vibe from the Tika folks when you told them that they did not have to go to Tribal Council?  It's an unusual feeling trying to manage your emotions when you learn that your fate in the game was just helped by someone else's physical pain. And when you are as depleted as they are, it's hard to hide your full truth. I could see the empathy in the faces of Yam Yam, Carolyn, and Josh, but I could also see and hear the genuine joy that nobody from their tribe would be going home tonight. Both were true.

Related content:"}, {"source": "entertainment-weekly", "title": "<em>Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> review: This fun fantasy romp is not just for nerds", "text": "Ever since Game of Thrones took over the world, fantasy storytelling has proliferated on screen. Last year alone saw the release of two mega-budget sword-and-magic TV shows striving to fill Game of Thrones' shoes, and the release of a new movie based on the world of Dungeons & Dragons certainly fits the same cultural pattern as Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power and House of the Dragon. But the difference between adapting a game like D&D rather than a series of novels by J.R.R. Tolkien or George R.R. Martin is that the goal is to capture an experience rather than a specific story -- and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves delightfully nails the fun of role-playing as fantasy characters with your friends. It doesn't require any prior playing experience, either.  Originally invented by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson in the '70s, Dungeons & Dragons has found renewed popularity in recent years -- part of that is the influence of Game of Thrones, whose showrunners openly talked about the inspiration they drew from the game, but there's also something to be said for the increasing attractiveness of social activities defined by imagination and teamwork rather than phone screens and computer graphics. Players create and control their own characters but work together as a unit to overcome obstacles introduced by the one player who takes on the omniscient role of  Dungeon Master.  It's endlessly malleable to different people's preferences and personalities -- even a DM's best-laid plans can get knocked off the rails by players' decisions -- which makes it fun to play over and over again.  You don't need to know any of that to enjoy the movie, though. After all, Honor Among Thieves is stacked with familiar faces: Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, and Rege-Jean Page play the main group of adventurers, with Hugh Grant taking on the villainous role of their ally-turned-adversary. Pine plays a bard, Rodriguez a barbarian, Smith a sorcerer, Lillis a druid, and Page a paladin -- all of those are familiar character  classes  to D&D players, and their various abilities are depicted accurately. But in a relief for viewers who have no idea what the previous sentence means, the screenplay does not just dump exposition about what each character can and can't do.  Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, Chris Pine, and Michelle Rodriguez in 'Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' | Credit: Paramount Pictures and eOne  Instead, their capabilities are vividly illustrated through entertaining setpieces. Even someone who's never played a role-playing game in their life can pick up that a druid's main power is shapeshifting into animals thanks to the early scene where Doric (Lillis) spies on the bad guys and then evades capture by changing into a bug, then a mouse, then a hawk, a cat, and a deer. You could say that each character represents a common D&D playstyle (with Pine's Edgin as the planner and Rodriguez's Holga as the hit-first-ask-questions-later muscle, to name two) but to the uninitiated, it's also just like a heist movie, where each team member brings a different specialty to the table.  The actors seem to be having fun, which makes a big difference in a film so reliant on special effects. Pine is one of the most charming modern American movie stars, and seeing him light up the screen here serves as a reminder that amidst recent dour performances in Don't Worry Darling and All the Old Knives, it's been six years since we last saw him just being fun and romantic in Wonder Woman. It's easy to forget that the success of the 2009 Star Trek was powered as much by his personal charisma as sci-fi nostalgia or J.J. Abrams lens flares! Grant, meanwhile, gets to tap once more into the hammy villainy that made Paddington 2 the internet's favorite movie. A hot air balloon emblazoned with his face spitting out gold all over a medieval city late in Honor Among Thieves is one of the best sight gags of the year so far.  What's especially welcome about the humor in Honor Among Thieves is that it doesn't wink or mock its material; the characters just say funny things and bounce off each other as organically as a real-life friend group. The fantasy elements are played straight, and the central story is a relatable romp about how people who fail as individuals can still succeed together. A little cheesy, maybe, but why not roll the dice? Grade: B+  Want more movie news?

Related content:"}, {"source": "entertainment-weekly", "title": "That <em>Mandalorian</em> twist explained: Who kidnapped Moff Gideon?", "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for Wednesday's episode of The Mandalorian,  The Pirate.   The first few episodes of The Mandalorian season 3 have been surprisingly light on villains. Sure, there was that creepy cyborg who kidnapped Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in the second episode, and Elia Kane (Katy O'Brian) has been wreaking plenty of havoc on Coruscant. But, apart from the occasional monster or Imperial officer, Din and Grogu haven't faced off against too many baddies this season -- until now.   The Pirate,  the fifth episode of season 3, reintroduces Giancarlo Esposito's Moff Gideon, the sadistic Imperial officer obsessed with capturing Grogu. When we last saw Gideon at the end of season 2, the New Republic had taken him into custody with plans to bring him to trial for his crimes. This episode reveals that he never actually made it to the courtroom: His transport ship was attacked en route, and now Gideon has disappeared. (You'd think that the New Republic would have noticed that their valuable war criminal had gone missing, but whatever! I guess they're busy.)  It remains to be seen whether Gideon's removal was a kidnapping or a rescue mission -- but New Republic ranger Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) discovers an intriguing clue. There, lodged in the ship's walls, he finds a piece of beskar -- suggesting that Gideon was nabbed by Mandalorians.  Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in 'The Mandalorian' Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) in 'The Mandalorian' | Credit: Lucasfilm Ltd.  It's an intriguing cliffhanger that raises major questions for the remainder of the season: Who really hijacked that ship and nabbed Gideon? There are two main options: The most likely scenario is that Gideon's Imperial cronies rescued him. Clearly, he still has his sympathizers: Elia Kane obviously remains loyal to her former Imperial overlords, and there's a good chance that she's working behind the scenes to rescue her former boss.  As for the beskar? The Empire has been known to steal and horde beskar in the past. (Remember, that's how Din got his shiny armor upgrade way back in the first season.) There's also a chance that Gideon's Imperial rescuers might be framing Mandalorians: Gideon clearly has no love for the people of Mandalore, given his past clashes with Din and his obsession with the Darksaber. Sending the New Republic on a Mandalorian goose chase would be the perfect way for Gideon to pit his two enemies against each other -- allowing him to continue his sinister work in the shadows.  Of course, the other option is that Gideon really was taken by Mandalorians. Most of the Mandalorians we've met so far tend to be good guys -- or at least neutral, remaining uninterested in the fight between the New Republic and the remaining Empire. But Mandalore was a vast place, made up of many fractured cells and societies. Moff Gideon played a key role in the destruction of Mandalore, and some Mandalorians might be eager to carry out their own brutal form of vengeance.  Complicating matters even further, there's a chance that Gideon could be working with Mandalorians. After the destruction of their homeworld, some Mandalorians chose to align themselves with the Empire -- resulting in elite warrior squads like the Imperial Super Commandos. These highly skilled warriors were first introduced in the animated series Star Wars Rebels, and it's possible that they could be working with Gideon.  Regardless of who the final culprit turns out to be, Gideon's disappearance spells bad news for Mandalorians like Din Djarin and Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) -- especially as Bo-Katan sets out to unite the scattered civilization under a common cause.  It also presents new problems for baby Grogu. Onstage at last year's Star Wars Celebration, Esposito told the crowd that Gideon has only one goal going forward:  I will squash that little green bastard.

I'm always giving advice to my friends,  You just need to take the high road. You need to do your best and try to stay in your lane.  And I really tried to communicate those needs to her. Even off-camera, we had multiple conversations about not talking about him and just respecting each other because that creates more chaos and drama and feelings start coming up. I really tried to draw those boundaries and when things would happen, I tried to remember,  What am I here for? This is not a competition. This is about what I want and exploring what I want.   It was upsetting at times, obviously, when things turned dramatic, because that's just not my thing. I'm not a person to be involved in drama. I tried to take it in stride and in the moment, take a deep breath and be like,  How am I going to handle this? I'm going to try to do my best and give grace and kindness in the scenarios that I was presented with.  It wasn't the easiest thing, but it was a really good growing experience for me, too.  What went through your mind when you learned Zack chose Irina over you?  I was surprised, honestly. Zack and I had built such a strong connection and I feel like I knew that he was my person. I felt like I had this knowing that this is my match, so I definitely was surprised. This is just my perception of it, maybe there was some fear around that, some fear around being out of the pods and getting into the real world with the pressure of my family and just different things like that that might come into play. So when I heard him say that, I was like,  I'm going to choose to be okay with this. If this is the journey that he needs to take, I'm going to be okay with that and I will be okay too. I'm not going to try to force anything or try to convince someone.  And even though in my heart, I feel like he knew that I was the right person to go with too, I just needed to let him go and do his thing.  Love is Blind. (L to R) Zach, Irina in episode 405 of Love is Blind. Cr. Courtesy of Netflix (c) 2023 Zack and Irina | Credit: Netflix  You had already told him that choosing Irina would affect how you viewed his judgement and his character. Did knowing that he proposed to Irina change the way you thought about him?  That's one of the moments where I wasn't so graceful and forgiving and pious; that was definitely an emotional reaction. Obviously, what I was seeing was completely different than what he was seeing from her. This doesn't necessarily get shown, but I never told him in detail what she did. I spoke very vaguely around it because I didn't want to try to convince someone or try to manipulate the situation, so he didn't have examples. He maybe felt like this was coming out of nowhere.  I really, really respect him as a person, and he is such a brilliant person and he also is extremely forgiving and full of grace, even more to the point where I am on some levels. I think through our pod experience, I even learned that from him. I would not have continued on going through with this process that became very challenging at the end if I didn't respect his judge of character and if I didn't respect him as a person. I think you hear me say prior to our breakup, right before we end things, that I apologized and that I reiterated that I did respect him as a person.  What was it like watching the episodes and seeing how Irina lied to Zack about you  mistreating  her?  I wasn't really surprised that she said that. I think it's just disappointing and I genuinely do hope that she's taking this opportunity to have growth. I felt very prepared going into this and knowing what I saw on my side of the pods and in the lounge, so it just didn't really surprise me.  Do you think that had any influence over his decision to propose to Irina over you?  I'm not sure. I really can't speak to that. That would be a good question for him.  What was it like watching the episodes where Zack and Irina go to Mexico for their post-engagement trip, all the way through their breakup?  Heartbreaking. Honestly. Even though Zack and I had ended things in the pods, I still believe he's such a good person and seeing it just was really heartbreaking and it made me feel really bad for him. No matter what, people don't deserve to be treated so poorly. I think it just spoke to maybe even some potential insecurities on her side or just lack of acceptance of herself that maybe she can't accept other people. That wasn't easy for me to see him being treated that way.  This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.  Episodes 1-5 of Love Is Blind season 4 are now streaming on Netflix.

In a dramatic fortnight for the Lilywhites, Antonio Conte was dismissed from his position after launching into an extraordinary rant in a press conference, following his side dropping two points against Southampton in the last game before the international break.  Days later, FIFA extended managing director of football Fabio Paratici's initial ban from all football in Italy, to come into effect worldwide. Despite this difficulty behind the scenes, however, it's looking like Spurs can still operate in the transfer market.  Antonio Conte addresses the press conference after the 3-3 draw with Southampton (Image credit: Sky Sports)  According to Spanish outlet Sport (opens in new tab), Clement Lenglet wants to continue his stay in north London, after becoming an option in Conte's back three this term.  The Frenchman arrived last summer from Barcelona on a year-long loan - and the report states that Levy has now approached the Catalan outfit to negotiate a permanent move.  A figure of just PS12.3 million (EUR14m) is being discussed, with talks advancing well, meaning that the deal could be tied up potentially before a new manager arrives.  Still just 27 years old, Lenglet was considered a first-teamer at the Camp Nou at one point, winning a La Liga title. As a left-footed centre-back on the left of the three for Spurs, he's made 27 appearances in all competitions while in north London.  Clement Lenglet looks set to move to England permanently (Image credit: Getty)  Tottenham are also believed to be in the market for another goalkeeper this summer - but their major transfer business could revolve around the future of record signing and talisman Harry Kane.  Lenglet is valued at just EUR12m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  More Tottenham Hotspur stories  Spurs are on red alert after reports emerged suggesting Manchester United are lining up a PS100m swoop for Harry Kane in the summer.  Former Tottenham player Jermaine Jenas has expressed his frustration at the club's record in cup competitions, after Spurs were knocked out of the FA Cup by Sheffield United.  And Beyonce - yes, that one - is causing Tottenham a scheduling headache as the business end of the campaign approaches."}, {"source": "four-four-two", "title": "Liverpool report: Reds in  strongest position  to sign PS70m Mason Mount ahead of FIVE rivals", "text": "Liverpool are at the front of the queue to sign Mason Mount, with big rivals also interested in the Chelsea star.  Mount is yet to agree an extension to his current contract, which he signed in 2019. His time at Stamford Bridge is scheduled to end in 2024, with Blues bosses offering a long-term deal similar to the ones that the likes of Benoit Badiashile and Mykhaylo Mudryk have signed since joining this season.  But should Chelsea fail to tie Mount down, there isn't a shortage of suitors interested in the midfielder. The west Londoners are open to a sale, given that Mount has fallen out of favour this season under Graham Potter.  Chelsea manager Graham Potter has favoured alternatives to Mount this season (Image credit: Getty Images)  Renowned German journalist Raphael Honigstein, writing for The Athletic (opens in new tab), claims that Liverpool are  serious  about adding the England international to their squad - and not just as a Plan B to Jude Bellingham.   Manchester United, Manchester City, Newcastle United and even Tottenham have been monitoring his situation since last summer,  Honigstein said.   The current league leaders, Arsenal, may well seek to strengthen their options at No.8 in the summer and will be well aware of Mount's pedigree - even if, at present, that is as far as their 'interest' has extended to date.   Among rival Premier League clubs, it is Liverpool who appear in the strongest position when it comes to pursuing Mount's signature.   Liverpool will attempt a midfield revamp in the next window. Of their current midfielders, Naby Keita, James Milner and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are all on course to be out of contract this summer and Arthur Melo will return to Juventus at the end of a season-long loan, while Jordan Henderson and Thiago will be 33 and 32 respectively by the start of the next campaign.   With that in mind, the interest in Mount from Anfield is serious.   Jurgen Klopp has plenty of work ahead of him, reshaping his midfield (Image credit: Michael Regan/Getty Images)  Plenty of teams bidding for Mount could well drive the price up, though. Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly is said to value the 24-year-old to be worth at least PS70 million.  Mount is valued at EUR65m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  More Liverpool stories  Jurgen Klopp has addressed the  clear need  for a Liverpool rebuild this summer - and reports suggest there could be a lot of money spent.  Josko Gvardiol is a top target, with Mason Mount on the wishlist, too. Seven other players are in the summer plans, with an eye on the future as well. A player dubbed  the next Luka Modric  could be targeted, while Benfica's latest starlet Florentino Luis is being considered. 15-year-old Kendry Paez is also being linked."}, {"source": "four-four-two", "title": "Chelsea could lose Reece James to Real Madrid - with his replacement already signed: report", "text": "Chelsea star Reece James is being eyed by Real Madrid, with Los Blancos looking for a new right-back.  The Cobham academy graduate has faced a tough season at Stamford Bridge with injury setbacks, missing the World Cup when he was sidelined in autumn. Under Thomas Tuchel, however, he established himself as one of the best right-backs in Europe both going forward and defending.  James signed a new six-year deal (opens in new tab) at Chelsea last September but with the club in a very different position from when he signed that deal - facing the prospect of missing out on Champions League football and looking at a rebuild this summer - it is possible that James may welcome a new challenge.  Todd Boehly has led a revolution in west London (Image credit: GLYN KIRK/AFP via Getty Images)  Now, Real Madrid have put the 23-year-old at the top of their shopping list to improve on the likes of Dani Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez in that position, according to AS (opens in new tab).  The report claims that James was the first-choice target as long ago as last summer. Other names, however, may be a little more realistic.  James would likely break the world record for a full-back sale - which currently stands at the PS60 million that Chelsea themselves paid for Marc Cucurella. Real might receive encouragement, however, from the fact that the Blues have already signed Lyon defender Malo Gusto as a ready-made replacement for James, should the England international leave for La Liga.  Other players on the shortlist for the position include Joao Cancelo - on loan at Bayern Munich from Manchester City - along with current Villarreal and former Tottenham stopper, Juan Foyth.  Joao Cancelo would be considerably cheaper to buy than Reece James (Image credit: Simon Stacpoole/Offside/Offside via Getty Images)  Chelsea will not feel pressured to sell, while the player is unlikely to push for a move so soon after signing a contract. With Real Madrid in the market for PS100m-rated Jude Bellingham, however, they may well choose to turn attention to James if they fail to capture the Borussia Dortmund teen.  James is valued at EUR70m by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).  More Chelsea stories  Graham Potter says he won't quit the Blues, despite poor form.  Chelsea are struggling with statistics showing recently that they're the worst scorers in the top four divisions of England. Transfer rumours are linking them with moves for former stars Tammy Abraham and Romelu Lukaku. Marc Cucurella could be sold after just one season, while contract rebel Mason Mount and N'Golo Kante are targets for Liverpool.  Chelsea have also apparently offered a swap deal to bring Joao Felix to the Bridge permanently."}, {"source": "four-four-two", "title": "Premier League highest-earning players revealed, featuring Erling Haaland's staggering bonus", "text": "The top-five highest earning players in the Premier League have been revealed by French publication L'Equipe (opens in new tab), with Erling Haaland's staggering bonuses also highlighted in the report.  Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne tops the list in England's top flight, with L'Equipe reporting that the Belgian's gross monthly salary is PS1.7 million a month (PS425,000 a week).  De Bruyne famously commissioned a data firm to break down in finite detail his worth to Pep Guardiola's team in 2021, duly helping him become the Premier League's best-paid player. In all competitions this season, he has scored six and assisted a further 21 goals across 35 games, proving his importance to Manchester City.  Most of those assists have come in setting up his team-mate Erling Haaland, who is reportedly joint-second on the highest earners list. Both the Norwegian and David De Gea are said to earn PS1.609 million a month - equating to PS402,250 a week.  However, what sets Haaland apart from the rest is the ridiculous amount of money he can - and inevitably does - earn through bonuses. Indeed, Haaland can more-than double his wages to PS865,000 a week when scoring at the rate he has this season, which includes a mind-boggling 28 goals in 26 games in the Premier League alone.  As previously mentioned, De Gea also earns the same basic salary as Haaland, but, with his Manchester United contract up in the summer and reports suggesting the club are keen on halving his wages, that is subject to change.  Mo Salah takes fourth spot in the list, taking home PS1.495 million a month (PS373,750 a week) at Liverpool, following the bumper contract he signed towards the end of the 2021/22 campaign.  While Liverpool have struggled this season, Salah has been one of the few savings graces. 21 goals in 38 games is a very decent return, regardless of them not hitting the same high standards he has set previously.  Finally, De Gea's Manchester United team-mate Jadon Sancho sneaks into the top five, earning a reported PS373,750 a week. Perhaps a surprise to some fans, Manchester United went all out to secure the winger's signature in the summer of 2021, splashing a further PS73 million on him as well.  The move hasn't quite worked out so far, but under Erik ten Hag's tutelage, there are promising signs Sancho will be able to eventually turn it around and prove his worth to the club.  While the figures Premier League players are earning is astronomical, they still fall a long way short of the best-paid footballers in the world.  According to L'Equipe (opens in new tab), Kylian Mbappe gross salary at PSG is EUR6,000,000 a month, which equates to roughly PS1.2 million a week. Neymar earns PS730,000 a week, while Messi is on PS690,000."}, {"source": "four-four-two", "title": "Arsenal report: Sensational EUR75m Brazilian attacker set for move", "text": "Arsenal are ready to add another Brazilian attacker to an already impressive cast of options up front.  The Gunners signed Gabriel Jesus last summer as a transformative figure in their attack, with director Edu Gaspar pivotal in the capture of his countryman. Jesus was added to the likes of Gabriel in defence and Gabriel Martinelli to form a Brazilian core at in the Arsenal squad, while youngster Marquinhos later joined in another deal that Edu masterminded.  The likes of Willian and David Luiz have been on the Arsenal books in recent seasons, too, highlighting just how well the Gunners have exploited the market for Brazilian stars. Now, another might be on the way.  Edu Gaspar has helped bring in a number of high-profile Brazilian stars (Image credit: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)  A report from GloboEsporte (opens in new tab) says Arsenal are among the European clubs chasing Porto star, Pepe. Pepe's representatives have already received an offer of around EUR50 million - though the attacker's release clause is for EUR75m.  This correlates with the rumours that the north Londoners are set to enter the market for another forward option - and with Portugal's Primeira Liga being a good transition to the Premier League of late with plenty of examples of stars blooming after moves, this is a deal that makes sense on a number of levels.  26-year-old Pepe - not to be confused with the veteran centre-back who has represented Portugal at international level - is right-footed and most often deployed on the left-wing, similarly to Martinelli. He is capable of operating on both flanks, however.  Pepe has stepped into the side following the sale of Luis Diaz to Liverpool and has impressed in Sergio Conceicao's side.  Pepe of Porto is a reported target for Arsenal (Image credit: Jonathan Moscrop/Getty Images)  There is interest reported from Arsenal's London rivals, Chelsea, while there are apparently a number of European suitors for his signature, too.  Pepe is valued at EUR22 million by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).

Victor Osimhen of Napoli is another Hollywood name on the list - and both would command huge fees.  But further down the list, the likes of Goncalo Ramos and Mohammed Kudus are on the radar, too. Both are much younger and more inexperienced but Ten Hag has faith that age is just a number when it comes to his transfer targets.

Football Insider (opens in new tab) have reported that Brighton & Hove Albion forward, Evan Ferguson is being watched extensively by United chiefs, ahead of a potential move this summer. The Irish striker has five goals and assists in just 10 appearances in the Premier League this season, with Kylian Mbappe recently praising him.  Ferguson has burst onto the scene at Brighton and been a huge hit under Roberto De Zerbi but with the Seagulls having sold big stars over the years, United will know that chairman Tony Bloom is easier to negotiate with than Tottenham's Daniel Levy.

After being appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in October that year, Rashford began a petition to end child food poverty, with demands made for expansion of the free school meals programme.  His petition soon passed one million signatures. The phone call to Manchester United came from Boris Johnson's personal secretary, with the world paralysed by pandemic back in November 2020.   Boris wants to talk to Marcus now,  Johnson's secretary said.   He's training,  Manchester United responded.   Well, you'll need to get him from training, because Boris wants to talk to him now.    Sorry, but he can't, he's training.   The UK's Prime Minister and one of the UK's top forwards did eventually talk, after the Red Devils had played Everton behind closed doors.  The Goodison Park scoreboard that day showed an image of Rashford along with the words:  Thank you for sticking up for our kids who needed a voice, here on Merseyside and across the country.   There's very little that unites Manchester and Liverpool, but Rashford managed it.  Sadly, no one was fortunate enough to be a fly on the wall for the conversation between Rashford and Johnson, but it was reported that Rashford, awarded an MBE a month previously, was  overwhelmed with pride  at the progress of his campaign to fight child food poverty.  In a government U-turn, ministers announced a PS170 million winter grant scheme, aimed at helping low income families struggling because of COVID.

One of the more comprehensive and extensive marketing jobs that has been done around an athlete,  a high-level PR specialist told FourFourTwo.  But it was well done and it did a lot of good.   Marcus became more comfortable with the messaging over time because he was intimately involved, but Kelly Hogarth [his then PR] was driving it and she did a very good job of it. Both for him and for what they achieved. He bought into it at the top level. He agreed to it, he pushed it.

Joking aside, playing on the verge of offside was my typical characteristic; something I'd look to take advantage of. I tried to hide on the offside line and attack from there. It's not easy to teach - it has to come naturally.   I played many times against Sir Alex's Manchester United, though we never spoke about this in person. I've received many compliments as well as criticisms throughout my career. I was used to them and never let them bother me too much either way.   Inzaghi played 680 times during his career for sides such as Juventus, AC Milan and the Italian national team, scoring 313 times in total. For him, this proves the quality of he striker he was.   If you don't score in big games, someone will moan that you're not a decisive striker; if your technique isn't perfect, people will say that you aren't skilful enough. I scored more than 300 professional goals - I knew what I could give and I'm happy with what I've achieved in football.   Critics always pushed me to be better and prove them all wrong. I was aware of my qualities and knew what I could do with the right attitude.   Among his critics was Johan Cruyff, who suggested the Italian  can't actually play football at all . The now-Reggina manager tells FFT he is confused by the suggestion, saying his goal record proves his skill.   I know that quote as well. He was an immense footballer, but I don't really know what he meant by the comment. I always knew I wasn't a striker who would dribble past people in elegant I know that quote as well.   He was an immense footballer, but I don't really know what he meant by the comment.   I always knew I wasn't a striker who would dribble past people in elegant fashion and play backheeled passes, but I knew how to score. Everyone has their own skills, and scoring is pivotal for any striker. I prefer to remember what my former Atalanta manager, Emiliano Mondonico, said about me: 'Inzaghi is not in love with goals - it's goals that are in love with Inzaghi.'

That's according to one report that says that the Scot's stint in north London looks likely to end after four years. Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has favoured the more possession-based Oleksandr Zinchenko in his starting line-up this season, relegating the overlapping runs of Tierney to the bench.  But while the Arsenal manager has opted against Tierney almost all season, he has told football.london (opens in new tab) that the left-back himself has been on the same page as him.  Mikel Arteta speaks to Kieran Tierney during a Europa League tie in Switzerland (Image credit: Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Getty Images)   Very good because we talked and we discussed the situation and we had a very similar opinion about that,  Arteta claimed.   He knows his role - under me he's played a lot, more than any other player probably compared to the previous players at the club in the last three years and he understands the situation and he needs to challenge the situation.   Despite this, football.london have suggested that January buy Jakub Kiwior could have been brought into the club to succeed Tierney.  Arteta has used the former Celtic man as an inverted full-back but on occasion, as opted for Takehiro Tomiyasu to fulfil the role instead. With Kiwior suited to playing at centre-back and in midfield - and having an exquisite passing range, too - the move to left-back would certainly make sense stylistically.  Is Jakub Kiwior the new Kieran Tierney? (Image credit: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)  The move would make further sense given the kind of profile that Arteta was looking for prior to Zinchenko. Last summer, Arsenal chased the ultimately Manchester United-bound Lisandro Martinez, who as a centre-back, is capable of playing in the first line of build-up.  While Zinchenko doesn't play here often, Kiwior does - giving Arsenal the option to play the same way on the left with Kiwior as on the right with Ben White.  Tierney is valued at EUR25 million by Transfermarkt (opens in new tab).

It was definitely a traumatic experience for me.   He came. He saw. He fell.  Of course, it wasn't quite that simple for Matthew Grinstead-Mayle. His journey to even get on Survivor 44 was long and arduous. He applied for years. He studied the game. He built challenges in his backyard. When Matthew finally did get on the show, he set out to aggressively embrace the adventure -- perhaps too aggressively.  While Matthew proved himself an able gamer by figuring out a new way to use the Shot in the Dark, finding a hidden immunity idol, and constructing and planting a fake idol that Jaime found soon after, all of that came undone when he decided on day 2 to climb a dangerous rock by the tribe's beach. When Matthew fell, his chances tumbled down with him.  The Ratu contestant tried his best to fight through the pain, but after another medical evaluation on day 11 -- and with the discomfort increasing rather than decreasing -- Matthew determined that the agony was simply too much to bear and left the game.  Did Matthew ever get an opportunity to say goodbye to his tribe? What happened after he left the game? And how is the shoulder now? We asked the sixth one out of Survivor 44 all that and more, including what happened to his immunity idol, what we didn't see, and if he's hoping for an invitation back a la Bruce Perreault.  Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: The last we saw you on the show, you said you had a big decision to make in terms of whether to continue in the game or not, and the next thing we knew you were gone. So when and where was that decision made?  MATTHEW GRINSTEAD-MAYLE: That decision was made just basically on the severity of my injuries. Survivor did a great job of portraying me in a really great light. One thing that they didn't really allude to was how much pain I was actually in. And the extensiveness of my injuries that I was suffering really were the reason that I had to bow out. I had to have shoulder surgery, months and months and months of PT. The laundry list of things that had to be addressed with my surgery is quite long. So it was the right decision to make, and [unfortunate] for me, but it was the right decision to make.  You made that decision at the examination after the challenge?  Yeah. They don't show it, but Dr. Will and I were talking, and I couldn't raise my elbow more than shoulder height. I was impaired. I could not move my arm. At that point, I had dislocated it twice in the game. We didn't know the extensiveness of my injuries, but I had fractured my humerus and had a piece of that broke off and had to be removed. I fractured my scapula that had to be reattached, my subscapularis, and that also had to be reattached. I tore my rotator cuff, I tore the lining of my shoulder. The extensiveness of my injuries [was] really, really wearing on me.  Did the pain get progressively worse over the 9 days, or did you tweak it again at some point? Were you just hoping you could tough it out for a few days and it would get better and then it never did?  After the initial fall on day 2, the extent at that point was I had just dislocated my shoulder. I was feeling a little loose, but that's why you could see me in and out of the sling. I wasn't really listening to the doctor's orders. But then, in the third episode, we're digging in the sand, and you hear me say,  Ow, guys, my shoulder!  My shoulder had popped out of the socket during the challenge.  So I gripped my arm and put it back into the socket in the challenge, climbed underneath the wooden log, and then helped Kane complete the challenge after putting my arm right back in the socket in the midst of all of that stuff. The adrenaline's going and you're just like,  I want to finish this. I'm not gonna stop.   Did you get a chance to say goodbye to your tribe?  I did not get a chance to say goodbye to my tribe. And I was sitting on an idol -- like, literally. I think that had I had the opportunity to meet with my tribe, that idol probably would have exchanged hands, because I really was Ratu strong. We bonded after our first Tribal and there was a kumbaya sense of unity. I really would've loved for one of them to see it through the end. So I would've pushed for one of them.  Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  You're saying that idol would've changed hands, but to whose hands?  At the time, it probably would've gone into Kane's hands. Kane and I at the time were extremely close. He was what I would've considered my number one. At that point in time, Brandon and I had formed a very loose alliance during the coconut challenge. [Laughs] It was the nuts that dragged us all down! But that alliance was very loose. When we got into the actual day-to-day, he and Lauren were connecting very, very strongly.  That led up to the first Tribal and me playing my Shot in the Dark. All those things all came together. But the tribe kind of changed a little bit [after] the first Tribal Council, with me being closer to Kane at that point in time. I would have given Kane the idol subtly if I could. if I had to do it in front of everyone, I probably would've given it to Lauren or Carson.  What happened next after you got on that boat out of the game?  Unfortunately, after I get boated off, we were still in Fiji in a Survivor COVID bubble. So when Bruce had to leave the bubble and then come back, he had to go through the quarantine process. There was that conversation -- do I make the trek all the way to the other side of Fiji to get an X-ray knowing that they can't really do anything for me? They can't reset anything. They can't do surgery. None of those things are going to happen.  So, the conversation was, knowing that there's nothing they can do for me, do I want to wait until I get back to the U.S., see my own doctors, and get the ball rolling on that end? Or do I want to leave the bubble, come back, and then have to be quarantined? It was really just a conversation of when do I want to get medical care?  Did sleeping and eating better at Ponderosa make you feel a little bit better?  Absolutely. The cuts and the scrapes and all those things like that... that was the first thing I could notice was that the health of my skin came back. I had massive cuts on of my feet from my fall. And once I saw that my skin was starting to come back and starting to heal, I was like, Okay, this is a good thing. I know that the rest of my internal things -- the things that I cannot see -- those things are getting addressed right now. It was to a point [during the game] where we were not eating anything. There were days when we didn't eat anything, and trying to recover from an injury that's not the best place.  They kept showing that footage of you falling down off of that rock. What was it like seeing that, because I could see that being pretty traumatic to watch?  We, as a cast, have access to a psychologist. We check in regularly, but if we are feeling high anxiety or need a need to talk to a psychologist, we have that ability. I took advantage of that, because I'm not a person that watches FailArmy or people falling or skateboarder falls. Like, I don't want to see that. Watching people get hurt is not something that I seek out.  So, watching myself get hurt on a loop was not anything that I was looking forward to. It was definitely a traumatic experience for me. To be honest with you, the actual fall, I have no memory of it. It's completely blacked out of my mind. My memory is walking to the rocks and then my memory picks back up with me being in that pool of water. I've seen it a thousand times, but it's almost like watching someone else because it's completely blacked out of my memory. I see that is me, but I do not remember the fall.  Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' Matthew Grinstead-Mayle on 'Survivor 44' | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  What's it been like for your husband to watch it?  He doesn't want to see me get hurt. He obviously had to deal with me with surgery, post-surgery, sleeping in a sling sitting up for six weeks. It was a rough recovery. He never wanted to see me suffer, but he had to go into the role of caretaker and make sure that I was not only physically okay and he could help me that way, but also help me mentally, because it was a rough struggle.  So much of my mental health is tied into my physicality and my ability to be outside. Sitting on a couch is something that's going to send me into a negative space. He knew ahead of time,  I have to help Matt through this process because this is going to be something that is going to be devastating to him personally, physically, mentally -- all of those things.  And it truly was. But I'm very grateful that he was there for me and he knows me really well. He helped me navigate through one of the roughest times that I've ever had.  Let's talk about some non-shoulder-related issues. Was your plan going into the game to always use your Shot in the Dark at the first Tribal so you didn't have to put a vote down on paper, or was that something you came up with as the situation developed?  We were on the boat driving to Tribal Council and I'm like, Okay, if everyone has told me the truth, I know where all the votes are going. I know that Lauren has this advantage. I know that she needs to not vote to bank her vote. Jaime was the original target and she had said,  I'm playing my Shot in the Dark  long before Tribal. Maddy and Kane were both voting for Brandon, and Brandon knowing about that was like,  I'm voting for Maddy.   I knew where everything was going, and I wanted to vote with Maddy and Kane. I wanted to vote with them, but I got thinking about it and I was like, I want the idol more. So I told Brandon that they were going to vote for him, and then it became a thing of, what's gonna happen after Tribal?  I knew that Kane was going to be on the outs because he's going to vote for Brandon. Jaime is scared and is not really strategically aligning with anyone. Brandon and Lauren are getting close at this point, so I see them as a power couple. And so if I vote with Kane and Maddy, Brandon's going to be pissed at me, right? So if I abstain from voting, then I'm kicked out of the whole situation so I can pick up Kane because I know Kane's going to be on the outs. Jaime's scared, so I can pull her in. And then Brandon's not acting all cagey because people are after him. He still thinks that I'm aligned with him. It allowed me to act in a very subtle way and it kept my hands clean. My goal was to flush that idol and find it. And that's exactly what I did.  What's something that happened that never made it to TV that you wish we had gotten a chance to see?  It was day 9 on the island, and I was scavenging for food. Our island was completely decimated. There just wasn't anything. We had maybe about two to three acres of area that we could live on. So, I am on the outskirts looking, and I have six coconuts for my whole haul. And I'm walking so slowly, and I see a piece of candy on the ground. [Laughs] Literally a piece of candy in a wrapper. It was yellow. And I dropped all my coconuts, looked around, and I grabbed that piece of candy, and I ran all the way to the other side of the island, hid under some brush, and I ate that piece of candy.  I told myself: Do not chew this, do not chew this, do not chew this. I hid until that candy dissolved in my mouth. And it was the best piece of lemon candy I've ever had in my entire life.  Hey, there's been other stuff that's washed ashore. In Panama, they found cocaine!  There was no cocaine on the beach! I promise my nighttime antics would've been very different [Laughs]  The Soka tribe on 'Survivor 44' The Soka tribe on 'Survivor 44' | Credit: Robert Voets/CBS  Any other challenges you built in your backyard to practice besides the snake maze?  Well, here's another thing that you don't know is that I was originally supposed to be on Survivor 41. I was cast and COVID hit, everything went bonkers. So that gave me this huge amount of time to prepare. If I went on 41, I would not have been the player that I was for 44. I wouldn't have been, there's no way. I built every single thing I could make. If I couldn't find it in my world, I made it. I would break down challenges into pieces. It was like,  Okay, I need a balance beam, and I need a bag of sand. Okay, got that part. Okay, I need to spin around and then I [need] to run this way. Okay, got that part.   It was just breaking it down into individual pieces and saying,  If I can try this at least one time, that will give me an advantage over everyone else.  Because oftentimes in my life, if I have the ability to do something once, it kind of gets the the cobwebs out and I have the ability to then start working on efficiencies and working on ways to just navigate it. My plan was to give myself as much exposure to every single possible element that I could of Survivor, because if I can try it once, then I can get through it.  When you saw Bruce get an invite back to play again were you like,  Hmmm... Is there another one of those invites out there?   [Laughs] I'm telling you, right now my bags are already packed. Tell me what color to be and I will make it happen. As a super fan, I got a lot of those big Survivor bucket list items, but the one that I didn't get was to see it through to the end. My biggest regret was obviously hurting myself, but I still had the journey of a lifetime even with a broken wing. I still affected the game. I still was an impact in the game. I still rose above it, like with the snake challenge. I have to take my arm out of my sling because I know I can do this and I'm not going to shy away from the preparation that I spent.  So I know that when the call happens, I am going to be even more prepared for that next round because if it is a second chance season, I already know Bruce is there. The people in this new era, if you go back even in the thirties, whoever they pull, it's going to be epic. It's going to be legendary. So I've got to step it up. Training for me next time started months ago. I'm already back in the gym, full training sessions. I'm two months ahead of where my PT wants me to be, so I am back to full body weight movements and being really aggressive with my training.  No rock climbing this time, though. Okay?  Not without gear! [Laughs] Not without gear and shoes. But if I go back, I will sign a contract to whomever that I promise I won't climb anything.

David Meyer here in Berlin, filling in for Alan.  The backlash against greenwashing is really getting real now.  Yesterday, German authorities raided the offices of Deutsche Bank and its DWS asset-management unit, looking for evidence in their investigation of alleged greenwashing--which they are treating as fraud.  As a spokesperson for the public prosecutor told Fortune's Christiaan Hetzner:  The allegations are that DWS has been advertising so-called ESG financial products for sale as being particularly green and sustainable when they actually weren't. In the course of our investigations we've found evidence that could support allegations of prospectus fraud.   Specifically, DWS stands accused of falsely claiming in its 2020 annual report that most of its assets were invested using ESG criteria. Not so, said a whistleblower. And this morning, hours after the raids, DWS announced that CEO Asoka Wohrmann will step down on June 10. (It maintains, however, that there was no wrongdoing.)  You know who's not surprised? Elon Musk, who has been grumbling about ESG metrics since Tesla got kicked off the S&P 500's ESG list last month--its environmental cred is fairly solid, but not so much its performance regarding the  social  part of ESG, which Musk claims has been  weaponized by phony social justice warriors.    I have yet to see an ESG list that *isn't* fraudulent,  Musk snarked in response to someone's tweet featuring Christiaan's story.  The culture warrior--who also just informed Tesla staff that  remote work is no longer acceptable,  raising a different kind of social question--clearly has his own ax to grind, but it's equally apparent that the validity of ESG claims is under unprecedented scrutiny.

In particular, [the Trump administration's] withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement and weakened methane emissions rules meant the United States lost precious time to mitigate climate change while many of its peers in the developed world enacted policies to significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,  the authors of the report, released Wednesday, wrote.  The U.S. ranking on the biannual report, which grades 180 countries based on 40 environmental performance indicators, dropped to 43 overall, down from 24 in 2020. Among its peers--other wealthy democracies in the  Global West --the U.S. placed 20 out of 22, beating out only Portugal and Canada.  Denmark, which the EPI notes has doubled its economy while halving its greenhouse gas emissions over  the past few decades,  is ranked No. 1. The U.K., which has likewise cut emissions almost in half since 1990, ranked second.  Most of the data Yale University used to compile its 2022 ranking actually comes from 2019, the report says, which means that although the Biden White House has since taken action to rehabilitate environmental programs scrapped under the Trump administration, it will take time for the data to reflect the results.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reports that the U.S. has reduced greenhouse gas emissions roughly 7% between 1990 and 2020, with an 11% cut in 2020--likely due to the pandemic slowdown.  The EPI, which is wary of government data, accepts that U.S. is reducing carbon emissions, albeit not nearly fast enough to meet Biden's bid to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In fact, the U.S. is on track to be one of the four countries--along with China, India, and Russia--responsible for half of global emissions in 2050.  According to the EPI report, only  a handful  of countries, including the U.K. and Denmark, are on track to meet commitments of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Jill Biden gets candid, the Platinum Jubilee will soon get underway, and a former SoftBank partner is tackling mid-career drop-off for working women. Have a lovely Wednesday.  - Inflection point. As Kirthiga Reddy advanced in her career, becoming managing director for Facebook India and then the first female investing partner at SoftBank Vision Fund manager SoftBank Investment Advisors, she came up with a years-long strategy to balance her work and home lives.   I decided early on that I was going to work really, really hard when my children were young,  she reflects now.  To be in a place to have more flexibility when they were teenagers.   The strategy was a  personal choice,  says Reddy, whose children are now 16 and 19. And she watched women around her make different decisions. The experience has been on her mind as Reddy, who is now president of the women-led SPAC Athena Technology II, launches her next endeavor. The executive is the co-founder of Laddrr, a platform launching today that aims to prevent mid-career drop-off for working mothers, Fortune is the first to report.  Kirthiga Reddy, former SoftBank investing partner and cofounder of the new platform for midcareer women Laddrr. Courtesy of Laddrr  Reddy, 50, cofounded the platform with Eightfold.ai CEO Ashutosh Garg, who came up with the idea after watching the career struggles his wife, engineer Shilpi Agarwal, encountered, like seeing interest from a hiring company dissipate when interviewers realized she was pregnant. Laddrr cites research from the Institute for Women's Policy Research, which found that a year without employment can result in 39% lower pay for women; the think tank ThirdWay, meanwhile, found that pay for fathers increases by 6% with each additional child--a gap often referred to as the  motherhood penalty.   Targeting women and managers in the U.S., Europe, and India, Laddrr aims to be an educational tool for women looking for support maintaining momentum in their careers or returning to the workforce after time spent as caregivers. To start, that will take the form of educational content about topics like how to talk to your manager about your parental leave and ways to stay up-to-date on skills during time away from a formal job. The website will also aim to reach companies and encourage organizations to do more to support mid-career employees who have children--not with at-home support as some platforms like Cleo offer, but with career development guidance tailored to their stage of life.  Reddy's own experience is one example of the kind of role modeling the platform aims to offer. While her choice to prioritize work while her children were young with an anticipated family payoff down the road may not appeal to all parents, she thinks they should know it's an option.  I've shared this with some younger moms as an alternate approach. They say, 'That seems interesting. That resonates with me,'  she says.  And there might be a different model that resonates with other young moms, or a third one.   Ultimately, Reddy and Garg's goal is to share information with women at a critical point in their careers. As Reddy describes the informal information-gathering many women do when they have kids or seek to return to work:  It should not be a black box of discovery every single time.

In market downturns, the rules may change", "text": "Good morning, CFO Daily readers. Kevin Kelleher here filling in for Sheryl.  CFOs have two common levers to pull when returning cash to shareholders: paying out quarterly dividends and repurchasing shares in the public market through buybacks. Both can present challenges when market selloffs signal a recession may be coming.  During the bull market of 2021, companies were generous with their largesse. Buybacks from S&P 500 companies rose 95% to a record $972 billion in the 12 months through March 2022. Dividends are also being paid at a near record pace: Net dividends for U.S. common stocks reached $70 billion in the 12 months through March.  But so far in 2022, the challenges are hitting fast. The S&P 500 Index is down 13% so far this year. Tech companies with high valuations like Netflix and Amazon saw double-digit declines in a single day after reporting disappointing earnings. But other, non-tech stocks did too, including Walmart and Under Amour.  As for a recession, while economists surveyed by Bloomberg foresee only a 30% chance of one in the coming 12 months, that's double the odds they predicted three months ago. And keep in mind that before the last recession officially hit in February 2020, economists were predicting a mere 27% chance of one happening. Economists, like most of us, have clearer vision in hindsight.  Recessions, of course, can mean lower profits if not losses. And that can make it tougher for CFOs to decide how much capital to reinvest in core operations versus how much to return to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Paying too generously to shareholders today can mean skimping on investments needed to share profits with shareholders tomorrow.   The ability of a company to sustainably and substantially grow their dividend over a business cycle is an indicator of quality,  says Nick Getaz, a portfolio manager at Franklin Equity Group.  But in order to return those dividends tomorrow, you have to be investing today.   In other words, if you're wondering whether Wall Street would rather you keep offering dividends and buybacks today, or invest in future profits (and therefore future dividends and buybacks) the answer is: Yes.  So is there any room for flexibility? Both buybacks and dividends can signal managerial optimism about a company's operations. Buybacks, though, are more suited to act as a release valve for excess capital in good times. And they offer more flexibility in execution: While companies tend to announce buyback plans well in advance, the actual repurchases can be timed with a bit more surgical precision.  Dividends, by contrast, work more like a regular cash bonus rewarding shareholders for loyalty. Aside from the occasional one-time dividend payment, most dividend policies are designed for the long haul.  A dividend, for all intents and purposes, is a commitment and an ability to live up to that commitment,  says Matt Quinlan, who along with Getaz is a portfolio manager at Franklin Equity Group.  With that in mind, it's not surprising that companies would be more willing to cut buybacks than dividends. During the Great Recession, quarterly dividends paid by S&P 500 companies fell around 30% between mid-2007 and mid-2009, while money spent on buybacks dropped about 85%.  That pattern is likely to play out again if a recession becomes reality. As tempting as buybacks may appear after a stock has lost a third or more of its value, CFOs face the same dilemma that any investor does wondering if they're buying at a market bottom or catching the proverbial falling knife. Yes, buybacks can shore up an oversold stock or boost a sagging EPS figure, but they are more likely to be effective once investors have established a consensus that markets have hit bottom.  Attempts to time financial markets with dividend policies, however, are more perilous.   Unless there's a material change in their business, most CFOs won't want to reduce their dividends during a downturn,  says Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial.  If your company is struggling right now, one of the last things you want to do is cut your dividend because it's a sign to investors that something's not right with your business.   The slow-and-steady, even-keeled policy most companies take toward dividends is one reason investors turn to high dividend-yield companies in tougher times. For now, many companies that can increase dividends are doing so. Last week, Lowe's raised its dividend 31%. Applied Materials boosted its dividend by 9% in April. Walmart inched up its dividend this year despite higher costs from inflation.  Saglimbene, Getaz, and Quinlan all expect companies to keep boosting dividends moderately in the near term despite the selloff in stocks this spring. If history is a guide, companies will pump the brakes on buybacks first. Only if a weak stock market transitions into a sluggish economy will CFOs start to pare back dividend growth-and even then in a cautious way.   Given that the economy's looking like it is slowing, the dividend growth could be slower than it's been in the last 12 months,  says Franklin's Quinlan.  Companies that are performing well will keep growing dividends, but those dividend increases may be smaller than they were a year ago.   See you tomorrow.  Kevin Kelleher  kpkelleher@gmail.com  Big deal  More CFOs are seeing clouds gather on the economic horizon, thanks to inflation, tight labor markets, and the specter of recession. A quarterly survey of CFOs by Grant Thornton found only 49% of CFOs surveyed in March felt optimistic about the economy over the coming six months, down from 69% last September.   Concerns about a possible recession coupled with the challenge of dealing with spiraling costs are definitely shaping strategy,  Enzo Santilli, a managing partner at Grant Thornton said in a statement. Half of CFOs surveyed said they plan to raise prices in response to inflation, while 60% plan to boost compensation budgets. Cybersecurity and supply chain disruptions also remain top concerns.  Going deeper  Hourly wages in the U.S. fell 2.4% last year, while median compensation for Fortune 500 CEOs jumped 30% to $16 million. Fortune crunched numbers to compare CEO pay to stock performance. CEOs at Altice, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Biogen emerged as having the highest pay relative to stock performance, while Moderna's Stephane Bancel topped the list of the most underpaid CEOs.  Leaderboard  Gregory J. Peterson will retire from his position as CFO at Southwest Gas Holdings (NYSE: SWX) after 26 years of service. Peterson has served as CFO since 2018 and had previously worked as controller and chief accounting officer at the company. Southwest Gas has initiated the process of finding a successor. He will depart no later than October 2022 and plans to help in the search and transition processes.  Ron Shelton was named CFO at Navitas Semiconductor (Nasdaq: NVTS), a maker of gallium nitride integrated-circuit chips based in El Segundo, Calif. Shelton had previously served as CFO at Adesto Technologies, a provider of application-specific semiconductors for IoT devices. Before that, Shelton was CFO at GigOptix, Cirrus Logic, and other chipmakers. Todd Glickman, who had served as interim CFO, will continue his role as senior vice president of finance at Navitas.  Overheard   The nasty selloff in the equity market seems to have brought the perma-bears out of hibernation. By some accounts, only two outcomes are plausible: mild or major recession. Our base case remains an extended period of weak growth, and we think any recession is likely to be mild.   --Research note from a team of BofA Merrill Lynch economists led by Ethan Harris.

But legacy rules also continue to burden this community.  Because of an outdated and discriminatory policy, men who have sex with men have been effectively barred from donating blood by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The ban was implemented in September 1985 at a time when HIV was fundamentally misunderstood and feared.  Today the ban doesn't make sense, particularly when you consider the advances in HIV/AIDS prevention, detection, and treatment. All blood collected in the U.S. undergoes rigorous testing for HIV.  However, organizations that collect blood like the Red Cross are forced to adhere to this policy, regardless of the realities of the science, because of mandatory FDA regulations. This policy is to these organizations' detriment: It prevents hundreds of thousands of would-be donors from giving blood that UCLA researchers estimate could treat over a million people.  So, why does Tinder have a role in this fight? As the leader of a company built on the magic of human connection, it confounds me that people who desire to help those in need are held back by prejudiced policies. Through our work with the Human Rights Campaign, I have come to understand how I can use my platform as CEO to help effect change. While I am not impacted by this policy personally, I firmly believe that caring people should be empowered to make a positive impact on society.  The LGBTQIA+ community is the fastest-growing part of Tinder's community, and I've personally heard countless stories from LGBTQIA+ users about our app being a place where they can be their true selves, sometimes even before they can be that person with their friends and family. That's something that we are deeply proud of, and we want to advocate for that feeling of belonging.  This week, our parent company Match Group is sending a letter to the FDA urging them to prioritize the Assessing Donor Variability and New Concepts in Eligibility (ADVANCE) Study, which will help find a more inclusive alternative to the current policy. The FDA says it cannot change the policy without this study but has not allocated the resources to get it done in a timely manner.  While the ADVANCE Study has been fully funded by the FDA, the organization has not put enough resources into the recruitment effort to ensure its success.  Tinder and Match Group are speaking out because the current policy is not only outdated, but it also risks alienating an entire generation of blood donors and preventing those most in need of blood donations from receiving vital care.  The pandemic has undeniably presented barriers to giving blood, but it would be a mistake to attribute the drop-off solely to that. Blood donation from the youngest generations has been steadily decreasing for more than 10 years.  Younger generations have been vocal about how they won't engage with organizations that have policies they don't support. More than 50% of Tinder members in the U.S. are aged 18 to 25. We are intimately connected to the issues that drive the next generation to action (or to boycott). We know that the sustainable, predictable supply of blood necessary for hospitals to perform lifesaving care depends on how powerful institutions address this issue. The FDA's policy needs to change now, for everyone's benefit.  Throughout Pride Month, Tinder users in the eight pilot cities where the study is running across the U.S. will be able to join us in our fight to help end this policy once and for all by swiping right on our  All Types  Pride Cards in the app, which will connect gay and bisexual men who are eligible for the study with more information and a way to sign up.  Despite the advances of the past few decades, members of the LGBTQIA+ community across our country are facing highly organized efforts to scale back their rights. It is time for the FDA to step up, prioritize science over stigma, and honor the hundreds of thousands of gay and bisexual men who are ready to contribute to our communities.

Hannemann pladiert fur einen Baustopp und fur alternative, okologischere Wohnformen. Auch das Umweltbundesamt veroffentlichte erst im Februar zusammen mit der Kommission Nachhaltiges Bauen ein Positionspapier , das Grundlage fur eine gesellschaftliche Debatte um das Einfamilienhaus sein soll.  Aus Umweltsicht besonders kritisch blieben insbesondere bei neuen Einfamilienhaussiedlungen am Stadtrand, ,,die zusatzliche Flachenumwandlung und -versiegelung sowie der damit einhergehende Druck auf Freiflachen und Verlust von Okosystemen und Biodiversitat , heisst es darin.

Grune traumen schon langer vom Ende des Einfamilienhauses im Neubau  Auf politischer Ebene ist vor allem den Grunen das Einfamilienhaus im Neubau okologisch schon langer ein Dorn im Auge. Hamburgs gruner Umweltsenator Jens Kerstan hatte etwa 2021 in einem Interview gefordert, keine neuen Einzelhauser mehr uber die bereits bestehenden und geplanten hinaus zu bauen. Eine Ausserung, die fur heftige Reaktionen auf politischer Ebene gefuhrt hatte.  Unterstutzung bekam Kerstan zu der Zeit zwar von seinem Parteikollegen Anton Hofreiter (Grune). Dieser sprach in einem weiteren Interview zwar nicht von einem Verbot fur die liebste Wohnform der Deutschen, hinterfragte sie aber sehr wohl kritisch. Bei der CDU entfachte die Kritik am Einfamilienhaus jedoch ein Feuer der Entrustung. Schliesslich besitzt das Thema bei den Vertretern der Unions-Parteien den Stellenwert einer Heiligen Kuh.  Einfamilienhauser immer teurer - das druckt auf die Nachfrage  Damals blieb der politische Schlagabtausch zum Einfamilienhaus zwar ergebnisoffen. Doch seit der Debatte von 2021 ist viel passiert. Und auch ganz ohne Verbot des Einfamilienhauses im Neubau scheint der Grunen-Traum zunehmend in Erfullung zu gehen.  So ist das Einfamilienhaus im Neubau durch die Preissteigerungen der vergangenen Jahre beim Bauland und Material sowie vor allem durch die immer teurer werdende Finanzierung fur viele Menschen ausserhalb des Budgets.

The U.K. has long prided itself on the absence of a written constitution. Instead, we bumbled along in quintessentially British fashion with our unwritten code of convention-one that relies on the decency, morality, and self-restraint of those within its jurisdiction to keep political propriety in check.  And until now, it had more or less worked.  Enter Boris Johnson. A man who, in under two and a half years, has taken a sledgehammer to so much, slashing the value of what it means to be British. A man who signs international treaties with his fingers crossed behind his back with no regard for the consequences.  One such treaty is the U.K.'s Withdrawal Agreement from the EU, which included the delicate details of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol was designed to protect the Good Friday Agreement by avoiding a land border on the island of Ireland. But it now transpires that Johnson deliberately overlooked the details in his quest to offer up the  oven-ready deal  that saw him win a landslide election in 2019.  In 2018, then-prime minister Theresa May said,  No U.K. PM could agree to the Brexit withdrawal text on Northern Ireland.  But Johnson is unlike any other PM.  With every week comes a new scandal. In April, we saw our prime minister fined for his COVID law-breaking, cementing his place in the hall of fame as the first-ever British PM to have officially broken the law.  Fast-forward to this week, and the British public has been confronted with newly released pictures of Johnson raising a toast at a No.10 party during the height of our second lockdown in November 2020. The law at the time forbade the mixing of more than two people indoors.  People died alone, funerals went ahead unattended, and elderly loved ones were abandoned-all in the name of following the lockdown laws that were announced by Johnson. Yet here he was, enjoying a  right royal knees up  at one of many lockdown parties that forced the investigation of the Metropolitan Police and subsequently led to No.10 being the most fined building in the entire country when it came to breaking COVID lockdown laws.  Back when good chaps were in charge, it would never have got this far.  Decency would have driven a leader to bow out after the very first COVID fine, so would lying to the Queen to prorogue parliament, or accepting Tory donor cash to refurbish his No.10 apartment.  Morality would have seen him step down after his absence of leadership landed our country, a small island, with one of the worst COVID death tolls in the world.  Self-restraint would have seen him concede that Brexit has been an unmitigated disaster: It slashed four percent off the U.K.'s GDP (twice the damage done by COVID so far at two percent), decimated entire industries from fishing to hospitality, and jeopardized peace in Northern Ireland after decades free from bloodshed.  But Boris Johnson will not resign despite polls showing 59% of Brits think he should. Instead, he is doubling down.  He has created a cult of conservative MPs so blindly loyal, that even the idea of a vote of no confidence to oust him is an act of sacrilege.  He was  clearly not partying  as Johnson had  lost his mum during the period,  Transport Minister Grant Shapps said in the prime minister's defense in a television interview on Tuesday. But Johnson's mother died suddenly 10 months after the party in question had taken place.  On Sunday we had Education Minister Nadhim Zahawi repeatedly stating on prime time TV how Johnson  does not, did not, would never intervene  in the report that exposes the extent of COVID law-breaking at N.10-only for Monday's headlines to confirm that Johnson had gone as far as to attempt to persuade the civil servant investigating the wrongdoing to drop the release of her report.  Earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab blamed the  intransigent  EU for  not showing flexibility  over the Northern Ireland Protocol-the same protocol that Johnson negotiated, signed, celebrated, and won an election on the back of.   Yes, I agreed it,  Johnson admitted in a TV interview.  I hoped and believed that our friends would not necessarily want to apply the protocol in quite the way that they have.   So, we're stuck with him. And he seems to be happy to gamble away a trade deal with the U.S., risk starting a trade war with the EU, and even more sinister, compromise decades of peace in Northern Ireland.

I put on a nice shirt and slipped on a pair of loafers and grabbed my car keys.  Let me tell you: Nothing greets you in that moment quite like a flat tire. After muttering a series of obscenities that were, regrettably, overheard by my neighbor, I pivoted: I could still attend my meeting, after all--on my bike. Perhaps others can relate to this, but when you never go into an office, and when you have gone long stretches of time without looking another human being in the (real, not virtual) face, you do whatever is necessary to show up in the flesh when possible--even if you arrive slightly disheveled, a little sweaty, and with your hair shoved up into a helmet.  I digress from the point I'm trying to make, which is this: I should have bought a new set of front tires yesterday, or perhaps in Nov. 2020--when I first purchased my vehicle. And, for some venture-backed companies, they probably should have gotten profitable right along there with me.  We'll circle back to the whole profitability thing, but let's keep talking about tires. Here's my confession: My two front tires have had a slow (but steady) leak since I purchased the truck. It's been getting worse the past six months or so. Up until today, you could find me at the gas station about every other week, pumping them up for $1.50 or so--a temporary solution to a more long-lasting, and expensive, problem I have been avoiding.  If I had just done the damn thing and bought a new couple of front tires, I'd be much better off. That's because tire manufacturers upped their prices about three of four times last year--lifting the price of tires by some 20% in a year. And they're expected to keep rising. This is bad news for Jessica who, not only has spent approximately $3 (give or take) a month to re-inflate her tires, but is now likely shoveling some 20% more than I would have needed to a year ago.  Back to companies. It's always nice to be profitable. But last year, it really wasn't too bad if you weren't. In fact, a Goldman Sachs index that specifically tracks a basket of unprofitable tech rose enormously in early 2021--from just over 100 points to more than 400, per Bloomberg. But that index started nosediving at the end of last year and has now lost around two-thirds of its value since then (Yikes!). By comparison, Morgan Stanley's similar index--the Morgan Stanley Unprofitable Tech Index--was down 64% earlier this month, according to Sequoia Capital's pitch deck it offered portfolio companies a couple weeks back. (I would show you these indices; however, neither of them are publicly available, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley didn't respond to requests for the underlying data)  All of this makes sense if you think about it. If you didn't have cash in 2021, that's OK. Go borrow some for free. Interest rates were zero. No profit, no problem. Now it, well, does seem to be somewhat of a problem. It's more expensive now, and relying on third-party cash doesn't seem to be as sustainable, or at least, that's what the market performance of these public companies seems to indicate.   With the cost of capital (both debt and equity) rising, the market is signaling a strong preference for companies who can generate cash today,  Sequoia wrote in its pitch deck from earlier this month, which you can read in full here.  Venture capitalists are telling founders this left and right: Have cash on the balance sheet--to the point that founders are already tiring of hearing about it. ( No shit. Thanks for the advice,  one recently told me.)  And hey--they do have a point. By now, the tires are already more expensive. So is borrowing money to run a business. So are a lot of other things: Like gas, food, and labor. In hindsight, yesterday looked like a pretty good time to get a few things done.  But I, for one, didn't. You can find me at the car mechanic down the road later today paying for it.  Snip, snip... SEC filings show that Fidelity is marking down its valuations of Reddit, Stripe, TikTok owner ByteDance, and Instacart--at least for reporting purposes, according to a new Bloomberg story. It's the latest indication of how late-stage private companies are following the public herd, even if they are lagging behind a few months. As a reminder, around half of Fidelity's mutual funds hold at least one private company, I wrote in a recent feature.

During the hearing on Monday, Akmal accepted that the incidents which formed the basis of the two charges pressed against him by the PCB had taken place, but pointed out that the circumstances were such that they did not merit reporting to the board.  The PCB had formally charged Akmal with two breaches of its anti-corruption code for two unrelated incidents on March 20. The charges come under Article 2.4.4, which deals with:  Failing to disclose to the PCB Vigilance and Security Department (without unnecessary delay) full details of any approaches or invitations received by the Participant to engage in Corrupt Conduct under this Anti-Corruption Code .  Akmal represented himself at the hearing, while the PCB was represented by lawyer Taffazul Rizvi. ESPNcricinfo understands that Akmal told Justice Fazal-e-Miran Chauhan, the disciplinary committee chairman, that the two incidents did take place, the conversations he had were questionable, as were the individuals present at the time, but he had his own reasons to not report them to the PCB. Rizvi argued, saying that Akmal was trying to deploy the  heads-I-win-tails-you-lose  approach, which is not acceptable in any court of law*.  Akmal's case had gone directly to the PCB disciplinary panel after he opted to forego the right to a hearing before the anti-corruption tribunal, where he could have pleaded his innocence and contested the charges. His decision not to do that meant, in effect, that he would accept whatever sanctions Justice Chauhan imposed on him.  Afterwards, a PCB statement said that Akmal had been heard  at length  before the verdict was passed.  ESPNcricinfo Ltd  Lt Col Asif Mahmood, PCB's director of anti-corruption and security, said,  The PCB doesn't take any pleasure in seeing a promising international cricketer being declared ineligible for three years on corruption charges, but this is once again a timely reminder to all who think they can get away by breaching the anti-corruption code.   The anti-corruption unit regularly holds education seminars and refresher courses at all levels to remind all professional cricketers of their obligations and responsibilities. And even then, if some cricketers decide to take the Code into their own hands, this is how things will pan out.   While Akmal has never before been sanctioned for breaching any anti-corruption codes, this might not be the first time he had faced a corrupt approach. In 2018, he claimed in a TV interview that he had been offered money to spot-fix at the 2015 World Cup, separately claiming that he had also been made an offer to skip certain key matches against India. It wasn't clear whether Akmal had reported these alleged approaches to anti-corruption authorities, but he has never before faced sanctions from either the PCB or the ICC for the same.  The ban comes as the most significant setback to 29-year-old Akmal, whose career has been littered with ups and downs. Repeated incidents of indiscipline since his debut in 2009 have meant that he has been fined and suspended, and an inability to stay fit has led to penalties as well. Recently, in September 2017, he copped a three-month ban for publicly criticising then Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur, and earlier this year, he was reprimanded by the PCB for misbehaving after failing a fitness test, reportedly exposing himself to a trainer in frustration at one point.  However, his quality as a batsman meant that Akmal stayed in contention despite the issues. When it seemed like Arthur had sidelined him for good, he was handed a surprise call-up for a home T20I series against Sri Lanka last year, in what was Misbah-ul-Haq's first assignment as head coach. He was dropped again after consecutive golden ducks, but strong domestic performances meant the possibility of another call-up was never far away."}, {"source": "fortune", "title": "4 vital steps that U.S. CEOs must take in the economic battle with China", "text": "U.S. companies are in denial about doing business in China.  Business leaders in general are almost certain that China will surpass the U.S. to be No. 1 in GDP at some point in the near future, and they feel compelled to sustain their relationships there. China is already the second- or third-largest market for many American companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Amway. Texas Instruments and Qualcomm each derived more revenues from China in 2020 than from any other country. Given the size of the opportunity, the CEOs and board members who are in denial tell themselves, their companies can't afford not to be in China.  But deep down the leaders of these businesses know that China's relentless drive toward self-sufficiency is likely to someday harm them. An American corporation is needed in China only until a Chinese company has the capability to be its most ardent global competitor. In many cases, sharing technology and intellectual property with a Chinese  partner  under the watch of the Chinese Communist Party is a precondition for a U.S. company's entry into the market. When the CCP relaxes that requirement, as it has for Tesla, BlackRock, and Goldman Sachs, it is likely only a temporary reprieve.  The ongoing flow of technology, know-how, trade dollars and direct investment from the U.S. to China helps America's economic rival achieve its goal faster.  U.S. corporate leaders have to take off their blinders and face the reality of what is making China more powerful and accelerating its dominance: They are! Efforts to stem the flow of technology and reduce the trade deficit have fallen far short, partly because of fragmentation in policymaking but also because of what corporate leaders continue to do.  There are signs that more business leaders are acknowledging the problem. In a survey of Fortune 500 CEOs, conducted in early May, 61% of those whose companies were involved with the Chinese market said they were looking to reduce their exposure to China.  Still, dealing with reality puts U.S. companies on the horns of a dilemma. If they stop or phase out the flow of technology, know-how, and U.S. dollars, how can they deal with the damage to shareholder value that is almost certain to occur in the short run as they forgo revenue in China?  The time is now for U.S. companies to face up to the problem. Their leaders must be preemptive, and prepare to change their business models or global footprints to counteract any hits they may take from the loss of business in China.  Business leaders should start by taking these urgent steps:  1. Acknowledge the party's power. Face the reality that participation in China's growing market is subject to the power of the CCP. The CCP can--and does--change the rules without warning, forcing non-Chinese companies to either leave or see their business reduced to a meaningless volume, as has happened to Ericsson and Nokia. The CCP can also take a range of actions that cause a precipitous drop in a company's market value, including for Chinese companies with a wide range of Western investors, as happened with the gaming arm of Tencent, Ant at Alibaba, and ride-share company Didi.  CEOs and boards should prepare for this tail risk. Investors will begin to factor that risk into their evaluations.    2. Diversify sources of revenue. Openly discuss the revenues and profits from China that are vulnerable; then work on creating a Plan B that reduces your dependency on those revenues. For companies that rely on China for a high percentage of their revenues, the dilemma is where else to find equivalent growth. I know of one large heavy manufacturing company that gets 20% of its revenues from China but is planning to exit over the next several years. My research suggests that this company is well ahead of others.  Have those conversations. Focus on countries whose economies are projected to have sustainable growth, even if they are small. These will be the battlegrounds between you and the competitor you're creating in China.  Beware of countries that have a record of coming close to debt default and bankruptcy. The Chinese are courting them to get their vote on competitive agenda items like standards setting (for example, for 5G). That creates a competitive impediment for you.  Apple is moving ahead of the curve. Having depended heavily on the Chinese market and supply chain, it is developing both the market and supply chain in India. Its cell phones are in the Indian market at a price point that keeps the iPhone premium but is appropriate for Indian incomes. Apple's cell phone sales in China peaked at some 71 million in 2015 and declined to just 35 million in 2020.  Along with a few of its ecosystem partners, like Foxconn, Apple has also been building its supply chain in India. Its leaders have discovered that India's greatest asset is talent, some of which needs to be developed. They are contributing to India's know-how and providing training. Companies like Apple and Foxconn are getting a tremendous welcome from the Modi government.  3. Bring your supply chain close to the customer. The U.S. can make almost anything it currently imports from China, thereby eliminating dependence on Chinese supply chains. Those supply chains in China were built with know-how from the U.S. and its allies in the first place. Now a wide range of new technologies are available to make supply chains more efficient and more tightly linked to customers than ever.  The movement of supply chains to India will likely accelerate. In the last six weeks, there has been a wave of heads of countries visiting India to discuss building their supply chains there. Japan has made India a strategic country and is one of the largest investors in India, and Dubai's IHC fund has made a multi-billion-dollar investment agreement with India's AdaniGroup.  Through my work with client companies, I have personally witnessed and verified the benefits of moving production close to the customer. With the use of new technologies and taking the total end-to-end cost into account, creating products close to the customer is generally more competitive.  The U.S. will benefit from helping countries to increase the purchasing power of their population and spur their GDP growth. It would be useful for the State Department to publish a list of items the U.S. must build in America to eliminate dependency on China for critical materials, but companies can act on their own.  4. Focus on your true competitive advantage, in your company and industry. Don't assume the low price of Chinese goods is a sign of superior competitiveness. My own experience and research has shown me, repeatedly, that without access to U.S. technology, and after stripping out the effects of managed currency, tariffs, subsidies, and risk insurance, Chinese companies are generally not cost-competitive. The real cost calculated on the basis of purchasing power parity shows that China is a high-cost producer compared with its U.S. counterparts in many subsectors.  Analyze the real, end-to-end cost from China versus your other supply chain options. Do data analysis of your industry and make the case to Washington about what needs to be changed in terms of trade policy. After all, the Chinese have been lobbying Washington to keep U.S. funds and technology flowing; it's your right and duty to act as a counterweight.  U.S. companies should be confident, keep honing their advantages, and protect their strengths from being conscripted by their rival.  China is deadly serious about its intention to surpass the U.S. and other democratic countries. It has clearly shown its willingness to intertwine economic and political warfare.  CEOs and boards should take the difficult steps needed to help protect not just their own companies' futures but also democratic principles and free and fair trade. Business leaders have a central role to play to preserve democracy. Let us muster the will and urgency to see the bigger picture and to act.

Dazu gehoren viele Lander Afrikas und Asiens und beispielsweise Indien und China , sagt die Geografin. ,,Gerade die Entwicklungslander sind am starksten von der Zerstorung des Landes betroffen - oft gehen die Ernteertrage um die Halfte zuruck. Die Folgen fur die 2,5 Milliarden Menschen in den Trockengebieten sind teilweise katastrophal.  Es fehle nicht nur an Nahrung, sondern es gebe auch verheerende Sandsturme oder Uberschwemmungen, da das Wasser nicht mehr versickern konne.  Auch in Europa - etwa in Spanien oder Suditalien - gibt es immer mehr Trockengebiete, in denen wenig Niederschlag fallt.

Here's what smaller hubs can do to attract VC dollars", "text": "For years, cities and regions across the U.S. have worked to become the  next Silicon Valley,  with plans to attract entrepreneurs and capital to transform themselves into the new leading innovation center.  Yet, EY's analysis of publicly available data shows that the top 10 markets for venture capital (VC) investing have remained the same over the past decade. This lack of change speaks to the difficulty involved in building a regional powerhouse for venture investment and innovation.  Dethroning Silicon Valley may not be a realistic short-term goal. But there are still lessons that economic development groups and individual entrepreneurs can take away from Silicon Valley's success.  Technology impacts every industry today. That means even legacy industries are ripe for innovation, and VC opportunities aren't limited to Silicon Valley.  Economic development groups can build and sustain an ecosystem that attracts capital by fortifying and branding local industries that feature a broad base of existing companies and a strong workforce.  Understand your region's strengths in attracting businesses and talent and identify ways to leverage them. What are the growth and innovation opportunities in your key industries, and what do startups need in the region? What can the city and region do to enhance the quality of life to attract skilled talent?  Be creative with the funding at your disposal, including federal, state, and local grants and programs that can be used to attract and support new companies. Promote your region as a destination for entrepreneurs and innovators in key industries, highlighting how the local economic development group works to build and support the ecosystem.  An example of leveraging a base of existing companies and a strong workforce is Austin, which recently recorded its fourth straight quarter of deal volume in excess of $1 billion, with 43% of that total going to business and financial service companies. It also boasts a business-friendly tax and incentives environment that draws entrepreneurs and investors alike.  Austin has clearly grown from a locale where technology companies have regional offices to a leader in new ideas and opportunities. VC firms are taking notice.  We are seeing some regions begin to reap the benefits of a concerted effort to grow their VC ecosystem. For example, Dallas and Jacksonville both had strong first quarters in 2022 in terms of activity and are emerging markets that are working to create a fertile environment for both entrepreneurs and investors.  It's not just Sunbelt cities that are benefiting: Chicago had its first-ever $1 billion quarter in early 2022, with 60% being invested in business and financial services. This is an example of leveraging existing domain expertise--in this case, finance--that is being disrupted by technology.  The key is to invest in community assets that appeal to entrepreneurs: local universities and colleges, high-speed broadband, outdoor recreation, downtown revitalization, flexible workspace, and more. Create public/private partnerships whenever possible to maximize funding and speed development.  Much of what makes Silicon Valley successful is the  pay-it-forward  culture that has developed over the years. Investors, entrepreneurs, advisers, and people with specialized expertise all serve as connectors, introducing people with ideas to potential customers and suggesting ways to access capital to help push their ideas and dreams forward.  That culture is replicable, but that requires people on the ground to do their part to get it started.  The local community of entrepreneurs needs to be engaged with one another: sharing ideas, making introductions, and passing along references. The knowledge of how to develop technology and turn it into a viable product is critical. Having local people who are willing to share their expertise and help entrepreneurs navigate that process is extremely valuable.  Regional hubs offer some advantages that Silicon Valley can't match, and entrepreneurs and investors are noticing. Rents, salaries, and other expenses are significantly lower in regional markets. That makes a big difference for startups--and for talented individuals seeking a better quality of life.  For example, Miami is a rapidly growing VC market that is benefiting from its one-of-a-kind lifestyle and unique cultural benefits. It has strong local government support to make it a technology and VC hotspot. As investors and entrepreneurs look for low-tax, business-friendly locales, Miami stands out in large part due to the quality of life it affords.  Ultimately, investors will go where there is money to be made. Silicon Valley has been the innovation leader, but regional hubs that focus on key industries and invest in an entrepreneurial ecosystem and culture will thrive in the years ahead.

Sri Lanka captain Chasing 252, it seemed like India were heading for a major defeat at 120 for 8, before the Kolkata crowd began to throw projectiles on the field and the match had to be forfeited. But it could have gone a completely different way. India's collapse was aided hugely by a crumbling pitch - something neither team saw coming. Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga has repeatedly said he would have batted second had he won the toss, owing to his team's preference for chasing. He also admits that batting second on that pitch was virtually impossible. Which means that had the coin fallen against Mohammad Azharuddin, it have would been India who progressed to that final in Lahore  What happened next  India could have won a World Cup final in Pakistan, for a start, earning them the kinds of epic bragging rights that the Pakistan team may never have recovered from. Also, even if India didn't win, given Australia were their opponents in the final, it would mean that teams that we now call the Big Three would have won every World Cup for the last 24 years. Disgusting.  There are tactical things. Would Virender Sehwag have thrilled a generation at the top of the order had Sanath Jayasuriya's rampages in the first 15 overs not brought his country a World Cup? Would Adam Gilchrist's or Chris Gayle's, or even Tamim Iqbal's careers have played out the same way? Would ODI strategy, which became intensely focused on opening batsmen in the wake of '96, have evolved in a completely different direction?  This was a bunch of bankers, salespeople and insurance guys who lifted the biggest trophy in their sport when they had no earthly right to. Without fantastical stories like this, cricket would be all systems, processes and resources, wholly without the joyful jewels of narratives that sometimes burst forth uncontrollably to upset the ceaseless march of professionalism. Without stories like this, tactical revolutions would so rarely upend the sport, heroes would come in pre-fabricated shapes and sizes. Fans across the world would be so much poorer too. On top of which, you would probably be a virgin your whole life."}, {"source": "fortune", "title": "The forgotten true story behind Memorial Day--and why it matters now more than ever", "text": "It was described at the time as  a procession of friends and mourners as South Carolina and the United States never saw before.   On May 1, 1865, a crowd of 10,000 formerly enslaved people and some white missionaries staged a solemn procession around the track at the Washington Race Course and Jockey Club in Charleston, South Carolina. The once high-tone club had been turned into a prison for Union soldiers during the waning days of the Civil War, and due to disease and injury, it had also become a mass gravesite. Upon  emancipation,  the formerly enslaved exhumed the bodies and provided them a proper burial, behind a new fence holding these words:  Martyrs of the Race Course.   According to contemporary news reports from the New York Tribune and the Charleston Courier, Black ministers presided over the parade, while three thousand Black children sang  John Brown's Body.  Members of Black regiments performed double-time marches. There were speeches. It was grand.  David Blight, a professor of American History at Yale University who was researching a book on the Civil War at the time, found a file titled the  First Decoration Day,  the original name of Memorial Day, in a box of unsorted records from Union soldiers held by Harvard's Houghton Library.  And inside on a piece of cardboard was a narrative handwritten by an old veteran, plus a date referencing an article in the New York Tribune. That narrative told the essence of the story that I ended up telling in my book, of this march on the racetrack in 1865.   Blight recounts this story in his 2001 book, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory. It was also an analysis of the naked attempt to disappear the poignant episode from the post-War narrative.  The war was over, and Memorial Day had been founded by African Americans in a ritual of remembrance and consecration,  he writes. That said,  white Charlestonians suppressed from memory this founding.   Other cities have claimed the first-ever Memorial Day event, but if the news reports are correct, then the Black community of Charleston wins not only for being first, but also for being the most dedicated to the virtues of gratitude, faith, and reconciliation.  It would have been a lovely story to share at summer barbeques and family picnics on Monday. But, no.   Americans faced an overwhelming task after the Civil War and emancipation,  writes Blight.  [H]ow to understand the tangled relationship between two profound ideas -- healing and justice.  Absent a national truth and reconciliation effort, the country was adrift to wrangle the  warring notions of healing,  that emerged in the aftermath of war.  So, a different story became necessary.   The sectional reunion after so horrible a civil war was a political triumph by the late nineteenth century,  writes Blight,  but it could not have been achieved without the resubjugation of many of those people whom the war had freed from centuries of bondage.   It seems that the notion that won the healing war was a violent return to a white supremacist power status quo, which was intentionally embedded without much question into the foundational infrastructure of the re-unionized nation. In the one hundred fifty-plus years since, that version of  healing  has led to unequal and self-reinforcing racist outcomes in banking and wealth, teaching and education, health care and wellbeing, popular culture, digital tools, and of course leadership opportunity.  The transformation of Memorial Day was gradual. Congress recognized Decoration Day as a federal holiday in 1938. People began to refer to the holiday as Memorial Day following World War II, and the federal government adopted the Memorial Day name in 1967--to include other veterans from other wars.  But the real history of Memorial Day had to go.  And so many years later, shoppers in Buffalo grocery story faced a mass shooter who was animated by fears of being replaced by inferior beings, and dominant culture executives go through their daily lives not so secretly worried that  inclusion  is a corporatized version of the same thing.  I think reframing history, like the story of the dedicated individuals who consecrated the Martyrs of the Race Course, is an essential skill in painting a more complete picture of society, justice, and the healing that hasn't happened since the Civil War.  This brings me back to you. While the world is uniquely exhausting these days, I find some odd comfort in knowing that the war--preferably of words, policy, leadership, and accountability--is not yet won.  Counterintuitive, I know.  I see new power in people who continue to press for equity when good people inside of good companies resist inclusion efforts. Or respond to the predictable backlash against a new movement for Black justice with renewed clarity of purpose. Or who continue to argue for a better way to reframe the narrative we were all born into when a community becomes unnecessarily roiled in a curriculum dispute.  These are all signs that reverting to the comfortable, segregationist mean is not happening without a fight. So, today I'm choosing new power, and all the stories that go with it--and hope you can, too.  We'll see what tomorrow brings.

On point  Black women are still denied executive jobs despite post-George Floyd inclusion goals Jessica Guynn, this time paired with Jayme Fraser, has done it again with this USA Today analysis of hundreds of top employers. White men are eight times as likely to hold a leadership position than a Black woman; white women are 4.5 times more likely, and Black men, who are barely represented at all, are twice as likely to be found in executive ranks than their Black female counterparts. Where are Black women found? Customer service, administrative support, and labor.  People only recently really started paying attention to the underlying reasons why Black women are not able to break into executive teams and boardrooms,  Evelyn Carter, president of diversity firm Paradigm, told the pair. Please read and share.  USA Today  The enduring whiteness of the C-Suite White men held 96.4% of the Fortune 500 CEO positions in 2000; as of early 2021, that number still hovered around 90%, as shown by research from Richard L Zweigenhaft, Dana professor of psychology at Guilford College in North Carolina. The progress was due to the ascent of white women, however. Nary were African-Americans, 3.4% were Hispanic, and 2.4% were East or South Asian. View the chart that tells the story: Latinx/Hispanics are the least represented among Fortune 500 CEOs, relative to their share of the U.S. population, but Black CEOs hold the role for the least amount of time--the average tenure for all Fortune 500 CEOs is 6.9 years, but for Black chiefs, it is 4.8.  Investment Monitor  The  pipeline issue  is a myth There are four foundational fallacies that underscore the persistently racist organizational practices that inspire executives to publicly say things like,  While it might sound like an excuse, the unfortunate reality is that there is a very limited pool of black talent to recruit from.  According to Autumn McDonald, writing in the Stanford Social Innovation Review, progress can't be made unless they're addressed. The four are objectivity, meritocracy, equal goalposts, and bad apples.  Hiring and promotion practices are often executed at the individual level, which can lead to the misconception that problematic behaviors are one-off occurrences,  writes McDonald.  It can be difficult to see the systemic nature of this sort of workplace racism.  It's not the apple, it's the whole tree.  SSIR  One hundred and one years ago today, an organized white mob started what would become a two-day assault on the lives and property of prosperous Black families living in a 35-block section of North Tulsa, Oklahoma. Some 300 people were murdered. The Tulsa Race Massacre, nearly lost to history, wiped out what was then called Black Wall Street, but as this in-depth reporting from my colleagues and me for the centennial, it didn't fully destroy the entrepreneurial impulse in the region. That said, it's complicated. There's also one important update. The last known survivors of the massacre--yes, there are survivors--can proceed with a reparations lawsuit.  Fortune  The American Psychological Association apologizes to people of color I covered this last fall, but it's worth re-sharing in light of our current conversation. Also, it's a good apology.  The American Psychological Association failed in its role leading the discipline of psychology, was complicit in contributing to systemic inequities, and hurt many through racism, racial discrimination, and denigration of people of color, thereby falling short on its mission to benefit society and improve lives. APA is profoundly sorry, accepts responsibility for, and owns the actions and inactions of APA itself, the discipline of psychology, and individual psychologists who stood as leaders for the organization and field.  What would an apology from other industries look like?  APA  Parting Words   Education is so important to creating change and fighting racism.

Despite being the country's best long-form spinner in this decade, there has been only one instance of Ashwin playing every match of a Test series held outside Asia.  Various factors have contributed to this situation, including injury to the player and selection based on horses for courses logic. Take India's most recent Test tour. Ashwin played the first match against New Zealand in Wellington but lost his spot in the next one to Ravindra Jadeja as the team management sought to bolster their batting firepower.  Despite this trend of not being picked consistently for overseas matches, Ashwin said his numbers since the Johannesburg Test in December 2013, where he went wicketless in 42 overs, have  significantly increased.   In an extensive conversation with Sanjay Manjrekar for ESPNcricinfo's Videocast series, he said:  See, one thing is for sure. I'm actually fighting my own benchmarks in a lot of ways. The number of games that I've managed to win for my country and for myself, the number of successes I've had and the excellence I've shown is always measured up in equal parlance when I travel away from the country, which is great.   Other topics Ashwin opened up on His success in Test cricket as new-ball bowler  How IPL was like a  slap on his face  early in his career  How WV Raman helped him build on the carom ball in 'isolation'  The 'reverse' carom ball  Why he has no time for old-fashioned coaching but has time for old-fashioned ways of building discipline  Why Sehwag was  carefree  about his failures and that is why he was brilliant  The future of fingerspin  Ashwin's numbers outside Asia have certainly become better after the 2016 tour of West Indies, where he featured in the whole series. Since then in 12 Tests outside Asia, he has picked up 44 wickets at an average of 27.65. Eight of those were played in Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand, where Ashwin took 27 wickets at 30.48.  Before 2016 , he had played nine Tests outside Asia, which yielded 24 wickets at 56.58  Since becoming a one-format player after the 2017 Champions Trophy, Ashwin has spent summers in the UK playing county cricket so that he can be a wicket-taker even on unfriendly pitches.   Increasingly the number of games I've played in England, I've started realising that for a spinner to be bowling in alien conditions and to be able to repeat similar numbers (as at home), you need to be bowling in all the possible right times of the game, first. And, secondly, you do need a little bit of luck. After 2014 [December 2013] when I had that South Africa game, I've taken a very serious look at my numbers and those numbers have significantly increased very, very well.   Ashwin also opened up on the hurt caused by critics who questioned him after his injuries at crucial times in the 2018 tour of England and later Australia. Ashwin suffered a hip injury during the fourth Test in Southampton and was again ruled out after the first Test in Adelaide.  Ashwin said his body had  let him down  due to the  stop-start  nature of being a single-format player. Asked whether technically he was facing any challenges overseas, Ashwin disagreed, saying he had grown wiser and better with every experience.  For me to able to deliver on a consistent basis abroad there are a lot of factors beyond just me that need to go into it.

Die gerade vorgestellten Zahlen fur das abgelaufenen Jahr jedoch zeigen: Das ist kaum noch zu schaffen. Schuld daran sind wir alle.  Dieser Bio-Bauernhof am Rande Dortmunds hat sich mit wochentlichen Kursen fur Kinder praktisch jeden Alters ein zweites Standbein geschaffen. Das Konzept uberzeugt, viele Eltern-Kind-Paare bleiben dem Hof jahrelang treu. Diesen Kindern braucht man nicht erzahlen, dass es nur im Fernsehen lila Kuhe gibt. Und die Nebeneinkunfte helfen dem Hof: Der Handel mit Bio-Gemuse und all den anderen Produkten ist kein Selbstlaufer. Als die Inflation auf uber zehn Prozent hochschnellte, sank die Bereitschaft vieler Deutscher, fur Bio-Produkte mehr Geld auszugeben als es fur die sogenannten konventionell hergestellten Nahrungsmittel notig ist. Erstmals sank der Umsatz von Bio-Nahrungsmitteln - um 3,5 Prozent.  Poldi ist der grosse Star unter den Kindern. Das Hangebauchschwein, nicht im Entferntesten zu verwechseln mit dem aus Koln stammenden Fussballer, ist zwar nicht besonders agil, zieht aber die Kleinen magnetisch an. Vor allem, wenn er futtert - was ubrigens seltener passiert, als man meinen konnte. Nach Poldis Mittagessen gehen die Kinder raus aufs Feld. Mutter, Vater oder Grosseltern versuchen Schritt zu halten und geben Hilfestellung, wenn der Nachwuchs Rote Beete, Kartoffeln und andere Feldfruchte aus dem Boden ziehen und in den Korben verstauen.  Neben einem Wandel in Industrie, Energie und Verkehr braucht es in Deutschland auch ein Umdenken in der Landwirtschaft. 56,3 Millionen Tonnen CO2 wurden hier alleine im Jahr 2021 ausgestossen. Gleichzeitig leidet hierzulande niemand so sehr unter den Auswirkungen des Klimawandels wie die Landwirtinnen und Landwirte. FOCUS online Earth untersucht in seinem neuen Themenschwerpunkt, wie deutsche Bauernhofe die Wende schaffen konnen - und wie Politik und Gesellschaft dabei helfen mussen.  Bio-Landwirtschaft legt nicht mehr so stark zu  Der Okolandbau in Deutschland wachst. Aber gemessen an den Zielen und Erwartungen wachst er viel zu langsam. Die okologisch bewirtschaftete Flache nahmen 2022 um 3,7 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorjahr zu, wie jetzt im Branchenreport des Bundesverbands Okologische Lebensmittelwirtschaft (BOLW) zu lesen ist. Aber das ist erstens weniger als zuvor und zweitens musste es deutlich schneller gehen, um wie geplant bis 2030 auf 30 Prozent zu kommen. Von Bio in der Breite sind wir weiterhin so weit entfernt wie das Schweinchen Babe vom typischen Nutztierstall.  Die Geschichte der hehren Ziele beim Okolandbau begann vor 20 Jahren: Die damalige Landwirtschaftsministerin Renate Kunast (Grune) hatte damals die Zielmarke 20 Prozent ausgegeben. Selbst das ist bis heute nicht erreicht. Deutschland liegt bei 11,2 Prozent. Wenn die neue 30-Prozent-Zielmarke bis 2030 noch erreicht werden soll, muss in den kommenden gut sieben Jahren noch eine Menge passieren.  Doch danach sieht es aber nicht aus. Das konnte auch zu Arger mit Brussel fuhren: Die Europaische Union verlangt von ihren Mitgliedstaaten, dass bis 2030 die Landwirtschaft zu 25 Prozent auf Oko basiert. Uberhaupt sieht sich die EU bei der Landwirtschaft ein Stuck weit in der Rolle des Suchtbekampfers - nur dass die legale Drogen hier nicht Alkohol und Nikotin sind, sondern Mineraldunger und chemische Pflanzenschutzmittel. Die Landwirtschaft soll bis 2030 mit der Halfte davon auskommen, so die Vorgabe.  Das neue Ziel: 100 Prozent Bio-Landbau?  In Deutschland setzt man sich weiter die ganz hohen Ziele, im Zweifel scheinen manche Politiker dabei auch den Status Quo erfolgreich zu ignorieren. So sprach sich Silvia Bender kurzlich sogar fur 100 Prozent Okolandbau als langfristiges Ziel aus. Das kann laut der Staatssekretarin im Bundeslandwirtschaftsministerium Realitat werden, ,,wenn die Politik gemeinsam mit der Branche die Hurden beseitigt, die mehr Bio im Weg stehen .  Auch Cem Ozdemir (Grune) glaubt, dass sich Bio bei der Mehrheit der Bevolkerung durchsetzen wird. ,,Mehr Bio in der Ausser-Haus-Verpflegung, mehr Geld fur die Okoforschung, starke Biowertschopfungsketten, eine Informationskampagne uber Bio - es gibt kaum ein Thema, das wir nicht anpacken werden, um die 30 Prozent Okolandbau Realitat werden zu lassen , sagt der Landwirtschaftsminister. Ozdemir will auch 2024 mehr Mittel fur das Bundesprogramm Okologischer Landbau (BOL) zur Verfugung stellen.  Warum es Bio-Landwirtschaft so schwer hat  Hans-Christoph Behr ist Fachmann der Agrarmarkt Informations-Gesellschaft (AMI) und giesst reichlich Wasser in diesen Bio-Wein. Das 30-Prozent-Ziel ist fur ihn nur noch in der Theorie erreichbar. Die Okoanbauflache werde zwar noch wachsen, aber die Kurve flache sich weiter ab, anstatt nach oben zu gehen. Die Grunde sind vielfaltig und je nachdem, wen man fragt, ist mal der eine und mal der andere besonders wichtig.  Die AMI sagt, es fehle vielen Bauern an Anreiz fur die Umstellung auf Oko, was mit dem Kosten-Nutzen-Verhaltnis zu tun hat: ,,Zuletzt haben sich die Preise vieler konventioneller und okologischer Produkte einander angenahert, zum Beispiel bei Milch.  Die Zahlungsbereitschaft der Verbraucher sei schlichtweg nicht mehr so hoch. Okoverbande schimpfen auf den Preisdruck des Einzelhandels, der Bauern das Leben erschwere und ,,faire Preise  kaum zulasse. Der Deutschen Bauernverband verweist darauf, dass das Thema Ernahrung nur im weltweiten Kontext zu losen ist.  Was jeder von uns tun kann  Doch die wahre Macht liegt bei denen, die essen und andere satt machen. Dass die Verbraucher je nach Kassenlage und Kochkunst mal mehr, mal weniger selbst entscheiden konnen, ob sie Bio kaufen, ist offenkundig. Sie wurden damit der Landwirtschaft die Richtung vorgeben, sind aber bei weitem nicht die einzigen: Auch Arbeitgeber konnen etwas andern. Nur zwei Prozent des Angebots in Restaurants, Kantinen und Mensen stammt aus Bio-Landwirtschaft. Viele Unternehmen sprechen gern von Nachhaltigkeit, setzen das aber in der eigenen Kantine nicht um.  Proteste der Beschaftigten und Betriebsrate sind selten, vermutlich weil nur die wenigsten mehr bezahlen mochten. Ozdemir plant, eine Bio-Quote von 30 Prozent vorzuschreiben, doch der Weg dahin ist weit. Viele Studenten protestieren bei Fridays for Future mit, mampfen in der Mensa aber ohne Widerrede Currywurst aus der Massentierhaltung. Und wer fragt im Restaurant wirklich nach, was auf dem Teller aus hinreichend zertifiziertem Bio-Anbau stammt? Psychologen antworten: Weil wir es nicht wissen wollen. Im Supermarkt bekommen wir eher ein schlechtes Gewissen, wenn wir zum Billig-Fleisch greifen. Aber in der Kantinen-Masse schwimmt man oft einfach mit.  Ubrigens hat sich die Bundesregierung zum Ziel gesetzt, in ihren eigenen Kantinen bis 2025 einen Bio-Anteil von 20 Prozent einzufuhren . Fleisch solle ,,moglichst  aus besonders tierschutzgerechter Nutztierhaltung stammen. Im Kuchenjargon wurde man diesen lauen Vorsatz wohl halbgar nennen.

Durre, Hitze und Uberflutungen gefahrden die Pflanze und die Ernte der Landwirte. Um sich dem Klimawandel anzupassen, muss die Kartoffel neu gedacht werden.  Die Kartoffel ist deutsches Kulturgut: Um ihren Siegeszug in Europa ranken sich Legenden , Konige wie Friedrich II. sollen ihren Anbau forciert haben , um ihre Macht zu sichern. Die Pflanze ist sogar so beliebt geworden, dass sie als Persiflage fur besonders nervige Deutsche herhalten muss.

FOCUS online Earth untersucht in seinem neuen Themenschwerpunkt, wie deutsche Bauernhofe die Wende schaffen konnen - und wie Politik und Gesellschaft dabei helfen mussen.  Warme Nachte , wie sie laut UBA seit Jahren zunehmend auftreten, gefahrden die Pflanzen und ihren Ertrag, da sie die Bildung der Knollen unterdrucken wurden: ,,Selbst, wenn die Pflanzen oberirdisch gut aussehen, bilden sie dann nur wenige Knollen und haben einen schwachen Ertrag , beschreibt der Wiener Biologe den Warmestress. Da reiche es schon, wenn es zum Zeitpunkt der Blute nur ein paar Nachte uber 25 Grad gibt.  Ein wichtiger Faktor sei Trockenheit : ,,Ohne Bewasserung kann kein Landwirt heute mehr Kartoffeln anbauen , so Teige. ,,Sonst kann man vertragliche Liefermengen nicht mehr einhalten.  Das sei nicht nur in der osterreichischen Heimat des Biologen spurbar, sondern auch in anderen Regionen wie Niedersachsen.  Die Landwirtschaft und der Klimawandel sind eng miteinander verzahnt. Dem Umweltbundesamt (UBA) zufolge gelten Emissionen aus dem landwirtschaftlichen Sektor nicht nur als Treiber des Klimawandel, die Landwirte selbst gehoren auch zu den Leidtragenden: Wetterextreme und sich verandernde Bedingungen sorgen fur geringere Ernten bis hin zu Ernteausfallen . Spurbar wurde das bereits im vergangenen Sommer, der von teils verheerenden Durren gepragt war: Die Ernte ging, verglichen mit 2021, um bis zu neun Prozent zuruck, teilte das BMEL im Herbst mit . ,,Die Kartoffel leidet also unter dem Klimawandel - teils sogar massiv , erklart Markus Teige, Pflanzenbiologe der Universitat Wien.  Prinzipiell funktioniere der Anbau auch ohne zusatzliche Bewasserung. Doch das wiederum konnte fur viele Bauern ein Nullsummen-Spiel werden. ,,Wenn ich die Kartoffel anbaue, ohne dass ich sie beregne, ist die Frage, ob sich das dann uberhaupt rechnet. ,,Das Pflanzgut, die Pflege und der Arbeitsaufwand auf der Flache kosten mehr Geld.  Schlussendlich konnen Landwirte mit der Beregnung hohere Ertrage, eine bessere Qualitat bei der Ernte und ihren Kostenaufwand bezahlen, so Feuerborn.  Mit diesen Stressfaktoren ist auch Olaf Feuerborn vertraut. Er ist der Prasident des Bauernverbandes Sachsen-Anhalt und leitet den Themenbereich  Kartoffeln  beim Deutschen Bauernverband (DBV). Vor allem die Frage nach der Bewasserung bereit ihm und anderen Landwirten Kopfzerbrechen.  Pflanzen werden ausserdem anfalliger gegenuber Pathogenen . Das heisst, vor allem Schadlinge wie Kartoffelkafer oder bestimmte Viren, die jetzt aus warmeren Gebieten zu uns gelangen .  Zusatzlichen Stress erfahren die Pflanzen, wennfolgt. Dann uberfluten die Felder und die Kartoffelpflanzen leiden darunter massiv. ,,Wenn ein Acker zwei Tage unter Wasser steht, reicht das schon, um die gesamte Ernte zu ruinieren , erklart der Experte der Universitat Wien.  Die Frage nach der Bewasserung wird zur Gretchenfrage  Wie ausweglos die Situation sein kann, wenn Wasser kostbares Gut wird, haben viele Menschen bereits im Durre-Sommer 2022 bemerkt. Fur Landwirte hiess das vor allem: Ernteausfalle .  Wer jetzt eine hitzeempfindliche, wasserintensive Pflanze wie die Kartoffel anbaut, muss sich etwas einfallen lassen, um weiterhin Gewinn einzufahren. So auch Landwirt Feuerborn, dessen Felder in Kothen im Landkreis Anhalt-Bitterfeld liegen: ,,Wir haben die Anbauflache um die Halfte reduziert und bauen dort an, wo es auch ausreichend Wasser gibt, um die Felder zu beregnen, damit das Ganze noch wirtschaftlich ist und die Pflanzen vernunftige Qualitat haben.   Bereits heute mussen Landwirte sich gut uberlegen, welche Sorten sich fur den Anbau rentieren. Der wichtigste Faktor: Darf man uberhaupt zusatzlich bewassern? Die Grundwasserpegel sind in den vergangenen 20 Jahren zuruckgegangen und werden in Zukunft weiter sinken. Schon jetzt verzeichnet der Durre-Monitor des Helmholtz-Zentrums eine ,,aussergewohnliche Durre  in Teilen des Landes. Fur die Landwirte ergibt sich hier also ein Dilemma: Ohne Bewasserung gibt es weniger Ertrag - aber mit sinkenden Wasserpegeln schrumpfen auch die Moglichkeiten fur Bewasserung.  Konsequenzen: Standortwechsel, hohere Preise  Doch Landwirte mussen sich in Zukunft nicht nur damit auseinandersetzen, wie sie Kartoffeln bewassern konnen. Auch wo Kartoffeln angebaut werden, wird sich verandern. ,,Die Anbaugebiete werden sich verschieben, und zwar dahin, wo man die Gunstregion noch hat. Also wo man mit ausreichend Wasser noch guten Ertrag erzielen kann, ohne teuer beregnen zu mussen , erklart Feuerborn.  Bewasserung, Standortwechsel, andere Sorten: All das mussen sich die Bauern irgendwie zuruckholen: ,,Das wird sich auf den Preis niederschlagen. Das Niveau, das wir jetzt haben, ist das, mit dem wir in Zukunft rechnen mussen. Darunter wird es nicht mehr gehen.   Auf dem Weg zur ,,multiresistenten  Kartoffel  Verdrangt wird die Kartoffel wohl nicht, anpassen muss sich die Pflanze aber schon. An der Universitat Wien koordiniert Markus Teige das Forschungsprojekt ,,Accelerated Development of multiple-stress tolerant Potato , kurz: ADAPT . Sein Ziel: Eine Kartoffelpflanze zuchten, die mehrere Stressfaktoren aushalten kann, allen voran Trockenheit und Hitze. Dafur kooperieren mehrere Forschungsinstitute, Regierungsorganisationen sowie Zucht- und Technologieunternehmen miteinander.  Unter mehr als 50 Sorten mussen die Forschenden nun die Pflanzen finden, die am besten mit Hitze- und Trockenstress, aber auch Uberflutungen umgehen konnen. Um diese Faktoren bestimmen zu konnen, werden in Feldversuchen an verschiedenen europaischen Standorten und im Labor phanotypische Untersuchungen gemacht. ,,Wir konnen genaue Komponenten finden, auf die wir dann genetisch schauen konnen , erklart Teige. ,,Das ist ja der Effekt der Zuchtung, man will die entscheidenden Gene finden, die den Unterschied in stresstoleranten Sorten machen.   Zuchtung neuer Sorten dauert bis zu zehn Jahre  Das Ziel von ADAPT ist einerseits die Zuchtung zu vereinfachen und auf der anderen Seite, schneller stressresistente Kartoffelsorten zu finden. Das ist dringend notig, denn aktuell dauert die erfolgreiche Zuchtung einer neuen Sorte mindestens zehn Jahre. Mit Marker-unterstutzter Zuchtung konnten die Zuchter diesen Prozess entscheidend beschleunigen. Die DNA-basierte Untersuchung erlaubt es namlich, unmittelbar zu entscheiden ob eine neue Sorte vielversprechend ist und ob diese die erforderlichen Voraussetzungen erfullt. ,,Damit kann man die Zuchtungszeit mindestens halbieren , so Teige. So liesse sich eine Kartoffelsorte finden, die mehr Durre-Tage als herkommliche Sorten aushalt und sogar noch ausreichend Knollen fur die Ernte bildet.  Die genauen Marker sind allerdings noch nicht bekannt. Um dafur moglichst viele Daten zu sammeln, fuhren das ADAPT-Team und dessen Partner in Europa eine Reihe an Versuchen durch. Im Suden der niederlandischen Nordseekuste wurde herausgefunden, dass der Boden sehr sandig ist. Das heisst:  Wenn es nicht regnet, trocknet er schnell aus. Und dort haben wir die Moglichkeit, Ertrag bei Bewassern und Nicht-Bewassern direkt zu vergleichen , so Teige. Durch solche Feldversuche konnen die Forschenden beobachten, wie gut neue Zuchtungen an ihrem jeweiligen Standort unter Stressbedingungen wachsen und wie hoch der Ertrag an Kartoffeln ist.  Die Feldversuche laufen noch bis zum Sommer 2024, anschliessend mussen die riesigen Datenmengen ausgewertet werden. Erst dann konnen Modelle entwickelt werden, um Gene zu bestimmen, die in neue Kartoffelsorten eingekreuzt werden.  Fazit: Landwirtschaft kann sich dem Klimawandel nicht alleine stellen  Die Bewaltigung des Klimawandels geht nicht nur mit weniger Emissionen, sondern vor allem mit Anpassung einher. Doch die eine Losung wird es nicht geben. Stattdessen muss die Bewasserung optimiert werden. Gleichzeitig werden wir erst stressresistente Pflanzen zuchten und diese dann ausgeklugelt anbauen. Landwirtschaft, Forschung und Unternehmen also an einem Strang ziehen mussen, um gemeinsam die Kartoffel als Kulturpflanze zu erhalten."}, {"source": "focus", "title": "Wenn wir das Klima retten wollen, muss die Wirtschaft brummen", "text": "Unternehmen fahren ihre Produktion zuruck, Haushalte heizen weniger und vielerorts wird Strom gespart: Die Energiekrise hat Deutschland stark getroffen.

Hier ist auch bereits der negative Einfluss der Gaspreiskrise in Europa zu erkennen, denn die Mehremissionen sind vor allem durch die zusatzliche Kohleverstromung zu erklaren.  Andreas Fischer ist Okonom fur Energie und Klimapolitik am Institut fur Deutsche Wirtschaft Koln. Zu seinen Schwerpunkten gehoren unter anderem Energie-Rohstoffe und Lieferketten sowie der Ausbau der Erneuerbaren Energien.  Plotzlich lohnt sich die Warmepumpe  Aufgrund der Schutzmassnahmen im Corona-Jahr 2020 waren deutliche Einschnitte zu beobachten, beispielsweise in der industriellen Produktion oder der Mobilitat. Dies fuhrte zu erkennbaren CO2-Einsparungen im Energie-, Industrie- und Verkehrssektor. Die Folge: Erst dadurch konnten die nationalen Klimaziele in einigen Sektoren uberhaupt erreicht werden.  Die seit Monaten allgegenwartige Energiekrise hingegen fuhrt nicht nur zu potenziellen Produktionsruckgangen und damit zu Einsparungen. Die hohen Preise fur fossile Energietrager konnen in ihrer Wirkung auch mit einem rasanten Anstieg des CO2-Preises verglichen werden. Dieser soll die Nachfrage nach fossilen Energietragern senken und dadurch klimafreundliche Alternativen attraktiver machen. Beispielsweise konnte es sich nun eher lohnen, eine elektrische Warmepumpe und eine Photovoltaik-Anlage zu installieren, um der hohen Gasrechnung der alten Heizung zu entgehen. Dabei machen nicht nur die aktuell hohen Preise, sondern auch die spurbare Unsicherheit aufgrund der starken Abhangigkeit von Energielieferungen die klimafreundlichen Alternativen deutlich interessanter.  Deshalb werden aktuell die erneuerbaren Energien erst recht als zentrale Moglichkeit gesehen, die Energieversorgung nicht nur klimafreundlicher, sondern auch unabhangiger, aufzustellen. Nicht zu Unrecht sprach Bundesfinanzminister Christian Lindner bereits von ,,Freiheitsenergien . Der Druck, die angestrebte Energiewende nun auch zeitnah umzusetzen, ist eindeutig gewachsen. Allerdings stellt die jetzige Situation die geplante Energiewende vor weitere Hindernisse.  Steigende Kosten und gestorte Lieferketten  Erstens sind die Auswirkungen beider Krisen auf die internationalen Lieferketten noch deutlich zu spuren. Dies trifft auch die notigen Komponenten und Anlagen fur die Energiewende. Beispielsweise sind die Preise fur Photovoltaik-Anlagen in den vergangenen Monaten gestiegen. Auch verweist die OECD auf Engpasse bei wichtigen Materialien und Komponenten. Demnach fuhrt der Einfluss der Corona- als auch der Energiepreiskrise zu deutlichen Lieferschwierigkeiten und Preisanstiegen bei den zentralen technischen Bausteinen der Energiewende.  Zweitens haben wir es zwar mit einer Preisexplosion fossiler Energietrager zu tun, vor allem Erdgas. Allerdings katapultierte der Erdgaspreis uber die Preisbildung an der Borse auch den Strompreis in ungeahnte Hohen. Dadurch wird zwar folgerichtig die Knappheit des Energietragers Erdgas abgebildet und es handelte sich nicht um ein Marktversagen.  Der positive Nebeneffekt der Energiepreiskrise, fossile Energien im Vergleich zu klimafreundlichen Alternativen deutlich zu vergunstigen, wird dabei allerdings ad absurdum gefuhrt. Denn die zentrale, zumindest potenziell, klimafreundliche Alternative ist Strom. Im Endeffekt ist durch die aktuelle Krise beispielsweise die direkte Eigenversorgung mit einer Photovoltaik-Anlage zwar attraktiver geworden - vorausgesetzt die notigen Komponenten sind auch verfugbar. Der Anreiz im Sinne der Energiewende, fur zusatzliche Anwendungen Strom zu beziehen, ist hingegen eher gesunken.  Investitionen bleiben aus  Drittens braucht es langfristig umfangreiche Investitionen in neue Anlagen und Prozesse, um die Energiewende umzusetzen. Dies gilt insbesondere fur die in Deutschland stark vertretene Industrie. Wenn allerdings in Krisenzeiten die Produktionen runtergefahren werden mussen, kann auch kein Geld erwirtschaftet werden, um dieses wiederum in klimafreundliche Prozesse zu investieren.  In den vergangenen drei Jahren lag der jahrliche krisenbedingte Wertschopfungsverlust in Deutschland laut Berechnungen des IW zwischen 120 und 175 Milliarden Euro. Infolgedessen fehlen oftmals die finanziellen Mittel, um konsequent in die okologische Transformation zu investieren. Dies trifft im besonderen Masse kleinere und mittlere Unternehmen, die harte Einschnitte weniger verkraften konnen.  Hier zeigt eine Umfrage des Bundesverbands der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) im industriellen Mittelstand, dass im Februar 2022 34 Prozent der Unternehmen aufgrund aktueller Preisentwicklungen planten, Investitionen in die okologische Transformation zuruckzustellen. Zum Zeitpunkt der bisher hochsten Gas- und Strompreise im August vergangenen Jahres stieg die Zahl auf 42 Prozent. Auch beispielsweise Stadtwerke und der offentliche Nahverkehr sind von den hohen Energiekosten stark betroffen. Dadurch fehlen perspektivisch finanzielle Spielraume fur neue Investitionen in klimafreundliche Technologien oder die Angebotsausweitung des offentlichen Nahverkehrs."}, {"source": "espn-cric-info", "title": "Five CSK games only hardcore fans will remember | ESPNcricinfo.com", "text": "Chepauk was used to watching Albie Morkel launch mighty sixes and whistling for him.

This week in What We're Watching, a trip down memory lane with one of the most dominant one-day sides ever - Lancashire in the 1990s.  Akram had already played his part with the bat as he clubbed 28 off 21 balls in a strong performance from Lancashire's lower order (that was a feature of their side, as you will see). Akram was usually held back from the new ball - Lancashire's one-day bowling options were tremendously deep - and on this day he came on as first change behind Paul Allott and Phillip DeFreitas.  He found the outside edge of Tim Curtis and then set about roughing up a young Graeme Hick, who soon edged to Warren Hegg as Lancashire took hold of the match.  Akram has looked likely to take a wicket with every ball,  said commentator Jack Bannister.  Surrey's epic meltdown  One of the most extraordinary collapses in one-day cricket. In the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup One of the most extraordinary collapses in one-day cricket. In the 1993 Benson & Hedges Cup first-round match at The Oval , Surrey were 212 for 1 chasing 237, needing 25 from 35 balls. Graham Thorpe had a century to his name and Alec Stewart was on 95 when Peter Martin nipped one back into off stump. Surely just a blip on the way to victory?  Then Akram was brought back, strangling Monte Lynch down the leg side and removing Thorpe, well caught at midwicket by Ian Austin, in the 51st over. Such was the pressure built by Akram, Martin and Austin that the runs required soon overtook the balls remaining as Surrey's middle order froze like rabbits in headlights although, in their defence, Akram and Austin produced a masterclass of yorker bowling. By the time the final over began, Surrey needed 14 with Waqar Younis (this was a golden era of the overseas player) and Martin Bicknell at the crease, but they couldn't really get close.  Akram with the bat, this time  Hick's century had led Worcestershire to a very competitive 261 for 5 in their 1995 Hick's century had led Worcestershire to a very competitive 261 for 5 in their 1995 Benson & Hedges Cup semi-final and Lancashire's chase was in the mire at 169 for 7 as Hick added two wickets for good measure. Lancashire, though, were far from finished despite needing 71 off eight overs.  Akram, with some help from Warren Hegg , took 19 off the 48th over to spark the chase into life. Akram swung his way to a 41-ball half-century as the nerves started to show in the Worcestershire team. There then follows one of the many lovely pieces of commentary from Richie Benaud's career:   A slight change of tactics, perhaps, now they've realised they only need fractionally better than a run-a-ball. May be that fewer risks will be taken...   Next ball: Hegg drives Phil Newport inside out over extra cover.   You can forget what I said there, pay absolutely no attention to it, and thank heavens Warren Hegg didn't hear it.   Akram was bowled with 24 still needed, but Lancashire's lower order was able to finish the job as Hegg and Gary Yates kept their cool.

And this time it was against their biggest rivals, Yorkshire, in Like the season before against Worcestershire, in 1996, Lancashire pulled a chase out of the fire. And this time it was against their biggest rivals, Yorkshire, in a gripping contest spread over two days because of rain that went to the last ball.  Michael Bevan and Richard Blakey had led a Yorkshire recovery with an unbroken stand of 167 and when Lancashire fell to 97 for 5 then 174 for 7, victory was a long shot. However, Hegg unfurled a brilliant 81 off 62 balls (it would remain his highest one-day score) to bring Lancashire to within touching distance when he was bowled with 11 needed.  Yates, who had played a vital supporting hand, was run out by a brilliant throw from Anthony McGrath and it came to eight needed off the final over, bowled by Craig White, with Glen Chapple and Martin at the crease. Chapple drove a boundary first ball, but White got his yorkers in to leave Martin on strike with two needed off the last delivery. It was a pretty good ball from White, a wide yorker, but Martin managed to drive it through point to send the home fans into ecstasy.

Lancashire labored to 186 all out, anchored by John Crawley's 66, but it would prove more than enough as Martin and Chapple devastated the Essex line-up.  Chapple's 6 for 18 is what the final is remembered for, but it was Martin's exemplary new-ball spell that set the tone as he removed Paul Grayson, Nasser Hussain (brilliantly caught by Hegg) and Paul Pritchard with a series of wicked legcutters. However, the ball of the day did belong to Chapple when he zipped an unplayable delivery past Robert Rollins.

Roberto Machado Noa | Lightrocket | Getty Images  Forget about Disney princesses. Mickey Mouse might have just proved who's the real king of Florida. The Walt Disney Co. used a legal clause that name checks King Charles III to apparently thwart Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' attempt to strip the company of its self-governance power in the state. For nearly a year, state legislators, encouraged by DeSantis, have sought to exert more control over the company's Florida-based theme parks by passing a bill that would dissolve Disney's special tax district. DeSantis also wanted to rename the area the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District and plant a new board of supervisors to oversee it. Until recently, there had been no major public discussion about dissolving Disney's long-established special district, which it's occupied for 55 years, leading DeSantis' critics to question its timing and the speed at which the governor acted against the company.  watch now  Widely seen as a contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, DeSantis became locked in a bitter and public feud with the entertainment giant over the company's denouncement of Florida's HB 1557 law early last year. HB 1557, dubbed by critics as the  Don't Say Gay  bill, limits early education teachings on sexual orientation or gender identity. Republican state Rep. Randy Fine told CNBC's  Squawk Box  last April that the bill wasn't retaliatory, but then said  when Disney kicked the hornet's nest, we looked at special districts.  While Disney remained quiet on the matter for months, it seems the House of Mouse had been hatching a plan to retain its control over the land within the outer limits of Orange and Osceola counties. On Feb. 8, the day before the Florida House voted to put DeSantis in charge, the previous Disney-allied board signed a long-lasting development agreement that drastically limits the control that can be exercised over the company and its district. As part of a 30-year development agreement, Disney no longer needs board approval to build high-density projects or buildings of any height and can sell or assign development rights. It also bans the board from using Disney's name or any of its characters.  March 30, 2023, Brandenburg, Brodowin: King Charles III. stands next to a cake made especially for his visit in Brodowin ecovillage during the royal visit to Germany. Pool | Via Reuters  The agreement includes a royal clause that dates back to 1692 in Britain and would extend its term limit for decades. This  Declaration shall continue in effect until 21 years after the death of the last survivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England, living as of the date of this declaration,  the document said. This kind of clause is most often used in the U.K., typically when it comes to trusts, and provides a buffer against perpetuities.  So, as long as one of those grandchildren makes it 80, this clause would be there for 100 years,  explained Robert Lord, senior advisor on tax policy at progressive group Patriotic Millionaires. DeSantis replaced all of the Disney-allied board members with five Republicans on Feb. 27. It was only then that Disney's new binding agreement was discovered. The clause was so obscure that several journalists who attended the Feb. 8 meeting apparently didn't pick up on it.  This essentially makes Disney the government,  Ron Peri, one of the new board members appointed to the CFTOD by DeSantis, said at the Feb. 27 meeting.  This board loses, for practical purposes, the majority of its ability to do anything beyond maintain the roads and maintain basic infrastructure.  Representatives for DeSantis did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Florida's attorney general requested communications records regarding the Feb. 8 meeting, according to a tweet from a Washington Post reporter. Florida legislators have balked at the new agreement, vowing to find a legal way to repeal or void the document. However, Disney says all of its conduct was legal.  All agreements signed between Disney and the District were appropriate, and were discussed and approved in open, noticed public forums in compliance with Florida's Government in the Sunshine law,  The Walt Disney World Resort said in a statement.

BNSF told FOX 9 approximately 22 rail cars derailed at 1:02 a.m. The Kandiyohi County Sheriff's Office says the train was carrying ethanol and corn syrup liquid. Numerous rail cars were engulfed in flames.  The EPA Great Lakes tweeted four cars containing ethanol, which is a highly flammable product, ruptured, caught fire and continue to burn.  Crews were still working to put out the flames as of 10:30 a.m.  No injuries have been reported. The cause of the derailment is under investigation.  Evacuation order ends; fire still burns  A sense of calm has replaced panic after a huge train derailment overnight near Raymond.  The derailed cars are still flipped on their sides and the nearby highway is still closed, but the fear of an explosion or dangerous air has dissipated, and evacuations are called off.  The cleanup process was really just getting started late Thursday night.  Crews built a staging area where they'll first put foam on the burning cars before cranes lift all of them upright.  Heavy equipment moved into place alongside the derailed BNSF train cars Thursday night.  Twenty-two of them careened off the tracks in Kandiyohi County around 1 a.m., startling a few Raymond residents who were still awake and heard a booming sound.   We saw the flames and at that time we're about 30 feet, I'd say, in the air,  said Susan Spieker.   I was just hoping it wasn't something like in Ohio where they had that big spill and I was hoping it was nothing like that,  said Wayne Haukos.  The view changed during the day, but the fire kept burning. 10 of the overturned cars contained ethanol -- the other 12 had corn syrup -- and Governor Tim Walz acknowledged the scary sight during a visit Thursday morning.   What you see right now is cars on top of each other and they're burning,  the governor said to evacuated residents.   It's a scary situation for all of you, I want to acknowledge this. You see a tanker car burning and your first thought is 'that's a big bomb waiting to explode.'   Even though some of the train cars were punctured and leaking, railroad executives said these cars are state of the art, so the risk of an explosion was almost zero.  Sheriff's deputies evacuated the whole city of Raymond in the early morning hours, but let everybody go home before noon.  Executives apologized for the scare and confusing inconvenience, and promised to work hard and fast to clean it all up.   Ethanol will burn off and we're monitoring the air and we're monitoring all the conditions around the derailment site,  said BNSF vice president Matt Garland.  Best case scenario is that the major work wraps up by Saturday and they can reopen Highway 23.  It'll still take the NTSB quite some time to investigate and release the cause of this derailment.

In the space of nine overs, Zimbabwe lost four wickets for 19 runs (c) AFP/Getty Images  From June 1999 to February 2004, Bangladesh had racked up some unwanted records - most consecutive defeats in international cricket, which included most consecutive Test defeats, the longest winless streak in that format, and the most consecutive ODI defeats. Now under a new captain, Bangladesh were hoping for better days.  Habibul Bashar, Bangladesh captain: The Zimbabwe team was far ahead of us in those days, that too in their conditions. We had already lost the Test series. I made a pair in my first Test as captain. While we waited for the rain to stop in Bulawayo [where the first two ODIs had to be abandoned], coach Dav Whatmore was trying to instil the mentality of trying to win rather than thinking about playing well and losing - he would tell us that there was no glory in that.  Mohammad Ashraful, Bangladesh batsman: One day on the tour, I was telling Shuvro bhai [journalist Utpal Shuvro] that the Bangladesh public treats us as heroes even though we don't win any matches. We have such a wonderful following despite our results. He told us: why don't you win one game and see what happens.  In the third ODI, played in Harare, Whatmore decided to open the batting with 20-year-old middle-order batsman Alok Kapali in the hope that he could take advantage of the field restrictions early in the innings (two fielders were allowed outside the 30-yard circle in the first 15 overs then) and help Bangladesh put up a total that their industrious bowling attack could defend.  Bashar: It was out of desperation that we decided to send Alok Kapali as an opener. He could play over the top and handle pace. We told him he could open in all five matches of the series even if he didn't score. We wanted to try things. Whatmore was a great planner. He knew that in order to win, we needed runs on the board in the first 15 overs.   When that partnership was broken, we smelt a win. Our body language completely changed. We started fielding like tigers. I realised at the time that this is what they call a winning mentality   But in the sixth over, Kapali was caught behind off Douglas Hondo for a 21-ball 9. The score soon slid to 20 for 2, and Bashar, leading his side for the first time in an ODI, was joined at the crease by 20-year-old Rajin Saleh.  Tatenda Taibu, Zimbabwe wicketkeeper-batsman: Douglas Hondo was getting onto the scene at that time. He was bowling well that day, getting the ball to move off the seam more than our other bowlers.  After riding out Heath Streak's first spell, Bashar and Saleh added 114 runs for the third wicket, a rare big partnership in those days for Bangladesh. While Bashar was the accomplished batsman in the side, Saleh's reputation as a steadfast top-order presence started to grow after this innings.  Bashar: It was the usual Harare wicket. It had enough for the fast bowlers. Rajin and I decided we would look out for Streak and [Ray] Price, their most dangerous bowlers, and target Hondo and [Blessing] Mahwire. We told each other we needed to bat for long.  Rajin Saleh, Bangladesh vice-captain: Batting with Shumon bhai [Bashar] is a different experience. He always spoke positively. In this partnership, he kept telling me that I was on top of the bowling. I started to believe it too. The other aspect in that partnership was the singles we took. The boundaries came once in a while, but Shumon bhai insisted we break down our stand into small portions: put together 20 runs and then take it from there.  Taibu: It so happens that Habibul and Rajin are both my friends. They played really good cricket during that partnership. They hardly gave us a chance.  Dav Whatmore and new captain Habibul Bashar were trying to push the players into adopting a more winning attitude (c) AFP/Getty Images  At Bashar's fall, Bangladesh sent in Mohammad Rafique as a pinch-hitter, but this promotion didn't work either; he was out for 6. Saleh and Mushfiqur Rahman followed him back into the dressing room in quick succession - Bangladesh had frittered away a good start, losing four wickets for 26 runs.  Bashar: After our partnership ended, it was necessary to use the slog overs and get as many as we could. This is where Dav stressed on getting a bigger total rather than settling for a respectable score on the board. We had to try to win the game. But we were on 160 for 6. It was part of Dav's plan to score quickly in the last ten to 15 overs. We were slowly making the players understand that we had to play certain roles for the team, and as captain and coach, we backed them when they failed.  It was left to the teenage Mohammad Ashraful to get the job done in the slog overs. He breezed to his third ODI fifty and added a record 51 in 33 balls - then the fastest 50-plus stand for Bangladesh - with Khaled Mahmud.  Ashraful: I came to bat with ten overs remaining and we needed as much as possible. I ended up making the fastest fifty for Bangladesh at the time. I was in good nick. I had made 98 in the first Test on that tour. It was the first time I played the scoop in an international match. I played a few against Heath Streak. They weren't too surprised, since I think they rated me as a batsman. With Shujon bhai [Mahmud], I got us to a competitive 238.  Bashar: Zimbabwe's batting was good, but if our pace bowlers bowled well, there was value from this Harare wicket, which wasn't a solid batting one like Bulawayo's. We felt, after scoring 238, that we had an opportunity.   When Tareq took the ninth wicket and started running off with the stumps, I reminded him that we needed one more wicket   Bangladesh got an early breakthrough when Tareq Aziz, playing his sixth ODI in two years, trapped Grant Flower for 2 in the fourth over.  Bashar: Tareq is hardly talked about when we mention this game. Usually Ashraful and I get the credit, but if it wasn't for Tareq's bowling, we probably wouldn't have won this game.  Zimbabwe recovered with a 109-run second-wicket stand between Barney Rogers and Stuart Carlisle.  Saleh: Between overs, I would go up to Shumon bhai and tell him that Zimbabwe had to make one mistake and we'd be back in the game. I told him to keep encouraging everyone.  Bashar: The partnership looked like the same old story for us. I remember Rafique bowled well, but we needed a wicket to lift ourselves up.  Mushfiqur Rahman, a promising seam-bowling allrounder, gave them that wicket - Rogers caught at point by Kapali in the 22nd over.  Bashar: When that partnership was broken, we smelt a win. Our body language completely changed. We started fielding like tigers. I realised at the time that this is what they call a winning mentality.  Mohammad Ashraful's fifty was the fastest by a Bangladesh batsman at the time (c) PA Photos/Getty Images  Taibu was sent to bat at No. 4 for only the second time in his ODI career. Although it turned out to be his most profitable batting position, it was still early days there for him.  Taibu: I was taking baby steps batting at No. 4, but I cherished batting at that position. I felt 239 was chase-able, easy to get.  He was caught off Rahman for 2, and when five overs later, Zimbabwe's top scorer, Stuart Carlisle, fell for 71, the hosts slipped to 140 for 5. Bangladesh were getting close, but one threat still remained.  Bashar: Streak could have changed everything in that game. He was our main concern. With him around, it was game over for us.  Streak shepherded the chase and took Zimbabwe close, falling to a memorable running catch from keeper Khaled Mashud when they needed 40 off the final five overs.  Bashar: Tapash Baisya got the wicket of Streak. He was another unsung hero for us in those days. In this game and later in our first Test victory, he gave us important breakthroughs but never got the due credit.   Bashar kept telling me that I was on top of the bowling and I started to believe it   Stuart Mastikenyeri now held the key, with Zimbabwe needing 13 off the final over.  Tareq Aziz, fast bowler: When they were deciding who would bowl the final over, I gave Shumon bhai the confidence that I can do the job. I had given away some runs in an earlier over, so I wanted to make it up. There was pressure, but I understood what needed to be done.  With the first ball of the final over, his sixth, Aziz clean-bowled Matsikenyeri. The Bangladesh team burst into celebration.  Bashar: It was a thrilling finish. Matsikenyeri could bat. When Tareq got him out, we were quite relieved.  Aziz: I just bowled it full on the stumps. You don't plan these things. Sometimes you pull it off. This was one of those occasions.  Aziz bowled Hondo with another full delivery, sending the Bangladesh team into a frenzy. The young fast bowler was on a hat-trick but he hadn't realised there was one more batsman to come.  Bashar: When Tareq took the ninth wicket and started running off with the stumps, I reminded him that we needed one more wicket.  Aziz: I thought Hondo was injured, but he came out to bat, and for some reason, I forgot they had another wicket left. When I bowled [Hondo], I started to take off the stumps. We all had a good laugh about it later in the dressing room.  In six overs, opening bowler Tareq Aziz took 3 for 38 (c) Associated Press  Aziz gave only four runs off the remaining balls and Bangladesh won by eight runs. It was their first ODI win in five years and their first international win since becoming a Test-playing nation in 2000.  Bashar: You can imagine it was a big thing at the time. I was on my first tour as captain and the Test series hadn't gone well. I hadn't convinced everyone about being captain. I had been a vice-captain for a year and my only experience as captain was leading Bangladesh A once.  Aziz: I just shouted at Shumon bhai, who fielded the last ball, to get the ball back. We started our celebrations. Most of us were shedding tears after the game. I think it was the first time we all realised we can also cry after winning a game.  Grant Flower, opening batsman: We always respected Bangladesh. They had some good cricketers. I can honestly tell you that we were not surprised. In the first few years, we always fancied our chances against them as we had a good team. I think they respected the way we went about our business. It was just experience. We played more cricket.  After Bashar stopped the final ball at deep mid-off, he pumped his fists and got together with the rest of the team near the pitch. It was the end of a painstaking period for Bangladesh.  Bashar: We rued not winning this game in Bangladesh because that would have meant a big party. Most of the celebration in Harare was among ourselves in the hotel afterwards. We had a long adda that night.

In der Pflanze steckt keine Gentechnik Aber keine Sorge: Gentechnish verandert sind die  FOCUS online/Wochit  Hitze, Durre, Starkregen: Der Klimawandel ist langst angekommen, auch in Deutschland. Uberschreitet die Menschheit bald kritische Kipppunkte im Klimasystem? Und ist das 1,5-Grad-Ziel uberhaupt noch erreichbar? Nein, sagt der renommierte Klimaforscher Mojib Latif. Ein Gesprach.  FOCUS online Earth: Herr Latif, in der Klimaforschung sprechen Forschende von Kipppunkten. Also kritische Grenzwerte, an denen eine kleine zusatzliche Storung zu einer qualitativen Veranderung im System fuhrt. Daraus resultieren unaufhaltsame und unumkehrbare Veranderungen. Haufig kommt Kritik auf, das Konzept der Kipppunkte sei wissenschaftlich nicht haltbar und im Endeffekt eine Erfindung. Stimmt das? Mojib Latif: Nein, das stimmt nicht. Das Konzept der Kipppunkte ist in der Wissenschaft etabliert. Die Frage, die sich stellt, ist, inwieweit man dieses Konzept auf das Klima anwenden kann. Das ist die eigentliche Frage - nicht ob es uberhaupt Kipppunkte in der Natur gibt. Und dazu muss man zwei Dinge sagen: Erstens, es ist plausibel anzunehmen, dass es durchaus solche Kippelemente im Klimasystem gibt. Wir haben in der Vergangenheit gesehen, dass es sehr schnelle und radikale Klimaanderungen gegeben hat, die man mit dem Konzept der Kipppunkte beschreiben kann. Zweitens ist es aber vollig unklar, ab welcher kritischen Erwarmung solche Kipppunkte ausgelost werden. Diese Unsicherheit wird in der Offentlichkeit kaum kommuniziert. Wenn ich von bestimmten Leuten hore, bei 1,5 Grad ist alles vorbei und so weiter... das kann man behaupten, es ist aber nicht wissenschaftlich belegt. Serios kann man nicht sagen, wann tatsachlich solche kritischen Schwellen uberschritten werden. Ob bei 1,5 Grad oder bei 2 Grad oder erst bei 3 Grad - man weiss es nicht. Aber das ist das beste Argument dafur, die Erderwarmung, soweit es geht, zu begrenzen. Stellen Sie sich vor, Sie fahren im dichten Nebel auf der Autobahn. Dann gehen Sie vom Gas runter, weil Sie ja nicht wissen, ob moglicherweise ein Stauende naht. Wenn wir nicht wissen, wann und ob uberhaupt etwas passiert, dann ist es doch das Beste, es nicht herausfinden zu wollen, also das Vorsorgeprinzip gelten zu lassen. Fur mich ist die Unsicherheit bezuglich der Kipppunkte, immer das beste Argument, schnell etwas gegen die Erderwarmung zu tun.  Uber den Experten Mojib Latif (68) ist Klimaforscher, Meteorologe und Professor am GEOMAR-Helmholtz-Zentrum fur Ozeanforschung in Kiel. Seit 2017 ist er ausserdem Prasident des renommierten  Club of Rome  sowie seit Januar 2022 Prasident der Akademie der Wissenschaften in Hamburg.  Kipppunkte werden oft herangezogen fur dramatische Warnungen zur Zukunft des Planeten, etwa wenn es um die Eisschmelze an den Polen geht. Wie hoch ist die Gefahr fur Forschende, dort etwas zu ubertreiben und in Apokalyptik zu verfallen? Latif: Das sollten wir nicht tun. Wir sollten immer auf der Basis der Wissenschaft argumentieren. Ich finde, was wir in den letzten Jahrzehnten erlebt haben, ist schon schlimm genug. Da muss man gar nichts draufsetzen. Wir haben 2019 in Deutschland einen Allzeit-Temperaturrekord von 41,2 Grad gemessen. Wir hatten letztes Jahr zum ersten Mal in Hamburg Temperaturen von uber 40 Grad. Und wer hatte gedacht, dass man sich in dieser Stadt einmal nach Regen sehnt, wie es in den letzten Jahren der Fall war? Und dann sehen wir inzwischen auch bei uns Waldbrande, die ausser Kontrolle geraten und was sonst noch alles passiert. Man muss gar nicht ubertreiben - man muss nur das dokumentieren, was tatsachlich passiert. Und das, was in anderen Weltregionen passiert, zum Beispiel in Spanien. Dort hat bereits jetzt im Fruhjahr die Waldbrandsaison begonnen oder die Flut in Pakistan im letzten Jahr, wo ein Drittel des Landes unter Wasser gestanden hat. Das alles zeigt, wie katastrophal die Auswirkungen bereits sind.  FOCUS online Earth - unsere Klima-Marke Der Klimawandel ist die Jahrhundertaufgabe der Menschheit.

Politische Streitfragen werden zunehmend als Wissensfragen verhandelt. Soziologen befurchten, dass typische politische Aushandlungsprozesse daruber verloren gingen. Es entstunde der Eindruck, dass sich aus dem besseren Wissen automatisch Handlungszwange ergeben. Aber aus der wissenschaftlichen Expertise heraus ergebe sich noch kein politischer Sachzwang. Wie gelingt es, zwischen epistemischen und normativen Fragen zu unterscheiden und entsprechend zu kommunizieren? Latif : Am Ende sind wir alle Menschen. Auch wenn ich mich um maximale Objektivitat bemuhe und probiere ausschliesslich auf der Erkenntnisseite zu sein, wird es mir nicht immer gelingen. Als Mensch bezieht man meistens doch normative Aspekte mit ein. Die Rolle der Wissenschaft kann idealerweise nur sein, Handlungsoptionen aufzuzeigen. Wir Wissenschaftler konnen nicht die Rolle der Politik ubernehmen. Es gibt es einen Diskurs in der Offentlichkeit und der hat eben viele Facetten. Kohleunternehmen werden vielleicht bei der Dringlichkeit des Handelns eher untertreiben und Umweltorganisationen vielleicht eher ubertreiben. Das ist eben in einer demokratischen Gesellschaft so. Aber am Ende entscheidet die Politik und das ist auch gut so. Wir in der Wissenschaft berechnen Klimamodelle, aber kein Modell ist perfekt und niemand weiss ganz genau, was passieren wird. Wir mussen also ein Stuck weit auf der Basis unsicherer Erkenntnis handeln. Da komme ich wieder zu meinem ersten Punkt: Wenn ich nicht ganz genau weiss, was passiert - moglichst den Ball flach halten. Von den Kipppunkten zum IPCC-Bericht. IPCC-Leitautor Oliver Geden von der Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik sagte anlasslich der Veroffentlichung des neuesten Syntheseberichts, die Menschheit habe sich mit dem 1,5-Grad-Ziel ,,moglicherweise selbst ein Bein gestellt  . Die Folge konne Fatalismus sein, sobald klar sei, dass es mit dem Ziel nicht mehr klappt - dabei sei jedes Zehntelgrad entscheidend. Wie blicken Sie auf das 1,5-Grad-Ziel? Stimmen Sie Herrn Geden zu? Latif : Das Pariser Klimaabkommen wird meiner Meinung nach etwas missinterpretiert, denn das Hauptziel des Abkommens ist es, deutlich unter 2 Grad zu bleiben und nicht 1,5 Grad. Warum das so in die offentliche Diskussion gekommen ist, weiss ich nicht. Und dann fragt man sich, was bedeutet deutlich unter 2 Grad: 1,9 oder 1,51 Grad? Alles, was belegbar unter 2 Grad ist, entsprache irgendwie dem Pariser Klimaabkommen. Joachim Muller-Jung meint hingegen in der ,,Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung  , die Spitze des IPCC habe sich  in seinem Zweckoptimismus selbst ubertroffen . Im Bericht lese man von ,,Botschaft der Hoffnung , ,,vielfachen, machbaren und effektiven Optionen  und ,,wir haben es immer noch selbst in der Hand . Er frage sich, ob der IPCC seine Strategie geandert habe. Wie sehen Sie das? Latif : Das weiss ich nicht. Ich habe diese Art der Kommunikation nie betrieben. Ich habe stets klar gesagt, dass es so gut wie ausgeschlossen ist, die Erwarmung auf 1,5 Grad zu begrenzen. Das wurde bedeuten, dass die Welt bis 2030 den CO2-Ausstoss mindestens halbiert. Das sehe ich nicht. Wenn ich einige Politiker in Deutschland hore, die sagen, dass wir unsere Emissionen senken mussen, damit das Klima nicht aus dem Ruder lauft, dann ist das so nicht richtig. Es zahlt nur der weltweite Ausstoss. Solange China oder Amerika ihren Ausstoss nicht deutlich verringern, ist es vollig irrelevant, was wir tun.  Es argert mich auch, wenn in den Medien die Worte der Politiker mehr oder weniger kritiklos ubernommen werden.  Allein China hat einen Anteil von etwa 30 Prozent an den weltweiten CO2-Emissionen. Ich sage nicht, dass es nicht wichtig ist, etwas hierzulande zu tun, dass wir Vorbild sind, weil wir auch eine historische Verantwortung haben, weil unser pro Kopf-Ausstoss auch viel hoher ist als der in Indien zum Beispiel... es gibt viele gute Grunde, warum wir etwas tun sollten, aber das Klima retten wir damit nicht. Wir brauchen globale Anstrengungen, sonst wird das nichts! Deshalb werden wir aus meiner Sicht die Ziele des Pariser Klimaabkommens nicht erreichen, denn der weltweite Ausstoss von CO2 steigt immer noch. Er sinkt nicht - er steigt. Selbst wenn er gleichbliebe, wurden wir die Ziele nicht erreichen. Es argert mich auch, wenn in den Medien die Worte der Politiker mehr oder weniger kritiklos ubernommen werden, ,,wir haben es noch in der Hand  und ,,es ist noch nicht zu spat , denn das, was die Politik auf den Konferenzen ankundigt wird international nicht umgesetzt. Das ist seit Jahrzehnten so. Wir horen jedes Jahr nach den Klimakonferenzen, dass die Lander zum 1,5-Grad Limit stehen. Seitdem das Thema auf der weltpolitischen Agenda steht, sind die weltweiten CO2-Emissionen explodiert und seit 1990 um circa 60 Prozent gestiegen. Deutschland hat seine Emissionen im selben Zeitraum um 40 Prozent gesenkt. Das zeigt, dass es geht, und Deutschland zu den Guten gehort. Der politische Wille ist in vielen anderen Landern, wie China aber nicht da. Gerade im Klimaaktivismus, Stichwort ,,Letzte Generation , wird immer wieder die Forderung laut: ,,Follow the Science . Macht es Sinn, wenn die Politik dem Konsens von Expertinnen und Experten bedingungslos folgt? Latif : Wenn die Politik der Wissenschaft bedingungslos folgen wurde, brauchten wir sie nicht. Politik muss abwagen und einen Weg finden, die Lebensbedingungen auf diesem Planeten und gleichzeitig einen gewissen Wohlstand fur alle Menschen zu sichern. Das zusammenzubekommen, ist nicht einfach. Wir mussen das Thema interdisziplinar angehen - mehr Interdisziplinaritat hatte auch bei Corona gutgetan. Wir mussen auch die Frage klaren, warum viele Burgerinnen und Burger nicht bereit sind, etwas zu verandern. Das ist unter anderem eine psychologische Frage und von daher braucht es eben den ganzheitlichen Blick. Im Bericht des IPCC ist die Rede von einem ,,sich schnell schliessenden Zeitfenster . Uber welchen Zeitraum sprechen wir hier und wie realistisch ist es, dass wir die beschriebenen, notwendigen Massnahmen umgesetzt bekommen? Latif : Es gibt ein globales CO2-Budget, anhand dessen sich errechnen lasst, wie lange uns bleibt, bis wir die Marke von 1,5 Grad reissen, wenn wir bei dem heutigen Ausstoss bleiben. Der Weltklimarat hat 2021 schon gezeigt, dass wir wahrscheinlich bereits in den 2030er Jahren die 1,5 Grad- Marke uberschreiten werden. Sie haben in einem Interview gesagt, das Erreichen des 1,5 Grad Ziels sei ,,Selbstbetrug . Warum? Latif: Das ist Realismus, sonst nichts. Warnende Daten und Zahlen von Umweltbundesamt und IPCC einerseits, Koalitionsstreitigkeiten um Verkehrs- und Warmewende andererseits. Warum ist die Dringlichkeit, die Wissenschaftler immer wieder einfordern, in der Klimapolitik der Ampel noch immer nicht hundertprozentig zu erkennen? Latif : Politik dreht sich im Moment nur um sich selbst. Beispiel Tempolimit. Naturlich retten wir die Welt nicht mit dem Tempolimit, aber die Tatsache, dass wir es nicht haben, ist doch ein Witz! Ein Tempolimit kostet nichts - es senkt den CO2-Ausstoss, hat zudem noch andere Vorteile und dennoch wird es nicht eingefuhrt. In anderen Landern brauchen sie mit Klimaschutz gar nicht erst zu kommen. Da geht es nur um Macht. Wie wollen Sie Herrn Putin dazu bewegen, etwas fur die Umwelt zu tun? Der hat ganz andere Dinge im Kopf. Wie wollen Sie die Chinesen dazu bewegen, keine Kohlekraftwerke mehr zu bauen? Das ist im Moment zwecklos.  Die Erneuerbaren Energien fristen ein Mauerblumchendasein.  Wie ermudend ist es fur einen erfahrenen Klimaforscher wie Sie, wenn langst etablierte Konzepte nach Jahrzehnten immer noch attackiert werden? Latif : Es ist frustrierend, aber nicht ermudend. Aber das Thema ist zu wichtig, um aufzugeben. Deshalb muss man sich motivieren und hoffen, dass Dinge passieren, von denen man es nicht erwartet hat. Tatsache ist ja, dass es Moglichkeiten gabe. Die Erneuerbaren Energien fristen allerdings ein Mauerblumchendasein. Auch in Deutschland - obwohl ich Deutschland ausdrucklich lobe. Wir haben unsere Energieversorgung gerade einmal zu 20 Prozent auf Erneuerbare umgestellt. Beim Strom sind wir gut - da haben wir mehr als 40 Prozent, aber beim Verkehr haben wir noch gar nichts gemacht und bei der Warme nur sehr wenig. Das zeigt ja, was fur einen weiten Weg wir noch zu gehen haben bis zur Klimaneutralitat und die wollen wir in Deutschland bis 2045 erreichen. Gibt es auch Vorbilder fur Deutschland? Von welchen Landern konnen wir lernen? Latif : Schweden hat beispielsweise einen sehr viel hoheren CO2-Preis als wir, und zwar schon sehr lange. Das hat aber nicht zu sozialen Spannungen oder Verwerfungen gefuhrt, weil man gleichzeitig andere Steuern abgeschafft und soziale Projekte gefordert hat. Der CO2-Preis wird auch hierzulande weiter steigen, das heisst: Der Staat wird mehr Steuern einnehmen und hoffentlich die Menschen spuren lassen, dass sie profitieren - dann werden sie den CO2-Preis akzeptieren.  Wir kriegen es national nicht gebacken!  Was macht Ihnen in der Klimakrise Hoffnung? Latif : Dass die Moglichkeiten zur Begrenzung der globalen Erwarmung vorhanden sind. Wenn ich ,,Konig der Welt  ware, wurde ich als erstes die Subventionen fur die fossilen Energien abbauen. Dann waren die Erneuerbaren Energien so billig, dass es da keinen Weg drumherum gabe. Und dann konnte man tatsachlich eine globale Energiewende innerhalb weniger Jahrzehnte hinkriegen. Wir brauchen internationale Kooperationen - die Klimakrise ist nur gemeinsam zu losen. Wir kriegen es national nicht gebacken! Eine letzte Frage. Wann haben Sie das letzte Mal gedacht: ,,Nach mir die Sintflut ? Latif: Gar nicht - so etwas denke ich nicht. Jeder Mensch hat eine Verantwortung, das mussen auch junge Menschen begreifen. Aufgeben ist keine Option!"}, {"source": "espn-cric-info", "title": "'This is a ball the whole world will remember' - Saeed Ajmal v Sachin Tendulkar revisited | ESPNcricinfo.com", "text": "It was a replay that rang around the world. Sachin Tendulkar is given out on the field to Saeed Ajmal , reviews it after a long discussion with his partner, and is reinstated by a Hawk-Eye projection that says the ball is missing leg. Tendulkar goes on to score a match-winning 85.  The replay was subject of conspiracy theories with many YouTube videos showing what the correct prediction path should have been. There is one difference between fans' rants and this replay: quite a few neutral experts found the prediction incredulous. Umpire Ian Gould , a man known for his humour and even temper on the field, was seen shaking his head when he saw the replay. Moments later, Mark Nicholas came on air and said,  It seemed inconceivable that that ball could miss the leg stump.  Sunil Gavaskar observed the ball had hit the inside of Tendulkar's shin, which is traditionally considered incriminating in such cases.  All these years later, keeping in mind what we have learnt from technology, we asked experts - and one participant - their considered view of the prediction.  Saeed Ajmal  This is a ball the whole world will remember. There has been a lot of debate over it already. Once Ian Gould gave it out, I was sure it would stay out because all it needed to do was clip the leg stump. And I overheard Sachin tell Gautam Gambhir,  Let me take a chance. Who knows it might save me?  Gambhir advised him against it because he felt he was out, but Sachin insisted.  Getty Images  The time taken in the review made me suspect something, but I can't say there was any foul play for sure. Even when I see the replay today, that looks 100% out. Even if it had been an umpire's call, it was given out on the field. You have to remember it was the straighter ball, but they showed a big break on it. I think they missed a frame in between; that's how it appears to me when I watch it again.  ALSO READ: Ajmal still baffled by Tendulkar lbw reversal  Sanjay Manjrekar  This was all new for us. This is Hawk-Eye and DRS, and we were not as experienced watching Hawk-Eye predictions and everything but when I watch it now, I think today as a commentator I would have said probably missing leg stump. Because you see where it pitched and where the impact is. So it turned big. If you watch the keeper Kamran Akmal, he has already moved down the leg side and then when it hits him [Tendulkar] on the pad, he comes back towards the stumps to appeal. So because we didn't understand angles as well as we do today, I don't think it is as controversial as it seemed at the time. This was all new for us.

Aakash Chopra  When I saw that Ajmal delivery thudding into Sachin's pad, my hand went up in the air because it was quite apparent that the ball would go on to hit middle and leg stump. It wasn't a ball that would've turned enough to miss the leg stump, and it was definitely not going the other way as much either. Tendulkar's decision to review the decision was, perhaps, more in hope than in belief. The Hawk-Eye trajectory taking the ball down the leg side - missing the three stumps - was quite astonishing. You knew that it was an error but an error that couldn't be reversed. My mind went back to another such dismissal in Sri Lanka where the ball was an offbreak but the Hawk-Eye trajectory showed it as a carrom ball turning the other way after pitching and, therefore, missing the stumps. It was a further reiteration of the fact that DRS wasn't foolproof yet; in fact, far from it.

The replay that rang around the world * ESPNcricinfo Ltd  Deep Dasgupta  My assessment is that the Hawk-Eye got it right. It was at best clipping the leg stump. Don't get me wrong, it was an extremely close call. It'll fall under the realm of Protagoras Paradox, in that both sides have convincing arguments. Saeed Ajmal is not a big turner, neither was the pitch a rank turner. The impact was within the stumps and post impact the ball landed on the off side, which means it hit the inside of the shin. My assessment is that the Hawk-Eye got it right. It was at best clipping the leg stump. Don't get me wrong, it was an extremely close call. It'll fall under the realm of Protagoras Paradox, in that both sides have convincing arguments. Saeed Ajmal is not a big turner, neither was the pitch a rank turner. The impact was within the stumps and post impact the ball landed on the off side, which means it hit the inside of the shin.  I have three pieces of evidence to make the call.  Ajmal bowled fairly from the top of the box, almost from the wide ball mark on the crease, which is 35 inches from the middle stump. That is bound to create an angle.  The ball pitched on the fourth stump, and hit Sachin in front of the middle stump.  At the point of impact, Sachin was on the front foot, albeit  half-cock , let's say seven feet from the stumps.  Keeping these three in mind, I'd say the angle of the ball would have missed the stump, maybe clipped the leg stump at best. If we add a hint of turn, which I reckon it did, I'd say Hawk-Eye got it right.  Saqlain Mushtaq  Absolutely plumb. That is my observation. Sachin's stride wasn't big. Yes, he was on front foot, but he didn't get a big stride in. If you see the trajectory of the ball, it is not loopy. It tells you it was bowled fast. Saeed Ajmal has himself said he didn't try to turn the ball. He bowled from mid-crease so he had an angle on it, but no turn. Because of the trajectory, it stayed low, so height is out of question. And it hit the inside of his shin, in front of middle after pitching just outside off. It would have hit the stumps. I can't say how the mistake was made. Absolutely plumb. That is my observation.

The final word: Hawk-Eye  Hawk-eye doesn't feel the need to clarify further after it Hawk-eye doesn't feel the need to clarify further after it made an explanation back in the day. There were two discrepancies that were popularly observed then. Firstly, the point of impact on the predictive-path replay was different from the last time the ball was seen in the replay. Hawk-Eye said the frame rate on TV cameras was 50 frames per second, and that they didn't capture the actual point of impact. Hawk-Eye cameras used the run-out camera too to calibrate and determine the actual interception point, the explanation said.  The other point of contention was the predictive track appeared to have moved to the right of what it would have been had it been a straight extension of the trajectory of the ball. The explanation pointed to gravity, and how the ball had already started veering off a straight line even before hitting the pad."}, {"source": "focus", "title": "Europaischen Gerichtshof fur Menschenrechte beschaftigen erstmals Klimaklagen", "text": "E-Mail  Teilen  Mehr  Twitter  Drucken  Feedback  Fehler melden Sie haben einen Fehler gefunden?

In Workshops bekommen die Hairstylisten grundlegende Fakten uber den Klimawandel vermittelt. Sie erhalten Tipps, wie das Thema gegenuber den Kunden gezielt angesprochen werden kann. Die Workshops sind Teil des Projektes ,,A Brush with Climate , das von der Saloninhaberin Rose Garcia aus Sydney ins Leben gerufen wurde. Sie hat damit bereits mehr als 400 Friseurinnen und Friseure erreicht. Garcia betont, dass Klimaschutz kein Thema ist, vor dem man Angst haben muss. Auch wenn nicht jedes Gesprach mit den Kunden uber Klimaschutz gefuhrt wird, konnen Friseure dennoch einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Aufklarung leisten, so die Friseurin. Denn sie haben engen Kontakt zu vielen Menschen, die sich um das Klima sorgen, aber nicht unbedingt wissen, was sie tun konnen. Das Projekt erhalt bereits Anfragen aus Grossbritannien und soll als Modell fur andere Branchen dienen. Laut der Sozialforscherin Rebecca Huntley spielen Friseure eine wichtige Rolle bei der Vermittlung von Fakten uber den Klimawandel, da sie einen breiten Teil der Bevolkerung erreichen wurden. In Australien seien viele Menschen zwar besorgt, wurden das Thema allerdings oft ignorieren, so Huntley. Das Projekt zielt darauf ab, Friseure zu ermutigen, den Klimawandel als Teil eines breiten gesellschaftlichen Diskurses zu sehen und ihren Kunden Informationen und Unterstutzung anzubieten. Die Schweizer Klima-Omas, die wegen Hitzewellen vor Gericht ziehen 10.44 Uhr: Kann ein Staat Menschenrechte verletzen, wenn er nicht genugend gegen den Klimawandel tut? Mit dieser Frage hat sich am Mittwoch erstmals der Europaische Gerichtshof fur Menschenrechte (EGMR) befasst. Hintergrund sind Klagen aus der Schweiz, aus Frankreich und Portugal. Je nach Ausgang der Verfahren konnte es fur Regierungen richtig ungemutlich werden. In diesem Sommer werden drei Klagen vor dem EGMR verhandelt, die sich mit der Verantwortung fur den Klimawandel beschaftigen. Den Anfang machten am Mittwoch die Klimaseniorinnen, ein Zusammenschluss von Schweizer Rentnerinnen, initiiert und unterstutzt von Greenpeace. ,,Das Spezielle an uns ist, dass wir die einzige Gruppe alter Aktivistinnen sind , sagt die 73-Jahrige Rosmarie Wydler-Walti. Die Klimaseniorinnen argumentieren, dass sie durch ihr Alter besonders durch den Klimawandel gefahrdet sind, beispielsweise wegen extremer Hitzewellen. Sie gaben sich nach der Verhandlung zuversichtlich: ,,Das Gericht hat erkannt, dass es dringend und wichtig ist, eine Antwort auf die Frage zu finden, ob Staaten die Menschenrechte von uns alteren Frauen verletzen, wenn sie die notwendigen Klimaschutzmassnahmen nicht ergreifen , so Wydler-Walti nach der Verhandlung. Ebenfalls am Mittwoch wurde auch der Fall eines franzosischen Burgermeisters verhandelt, der fur die Einhaltung der Pariser Klimaziele klagt. Spater im Sommer gehen ausserdem portugiesische Jugendliche gegen 33 Mitgliedstaaten des Europarats vor. ,,Der EGMR hat sich zwar zuvor schon mit Umweltemissionen - Larm oder Luftverschmutzung - auseinandergesetzt, aber noch nie mit den CO2-Emissionen eines Landes , sagte die Volkerrechtlerin Birgit Peters von der Universitat Trier. Deswegen wird das Verfahren zur Klage der Klimaseniorinnen mit besonderer Spannung erwartet. ,,Es bestehen Anzeichen dafur, dass das Gericht die Beschwerde der Klimaseniorinnen zum Anlass nehmen wird, um einheitliche Grundsatze fur alle drei ahnlich gelagerten Falle auszuarbeiten , sagte der Umweltrechtler Johannes Reich von der Universitat Zurich.  AP Photo/Jean-Francois Badias  Gerade weil umweltrechtliche Fragen bisher keine grosse Rolle vor dem EGMR gespielt haben, ist eine Vorhersage sehr schwierig. ,,Das Spektrum der moglichen Entscheidungen, die das Gericht treffen kann, ist daher weit gespannt: Es reicht von der Unzulassigkeit der Klage bis hin zu detaillierten gerichtlichen Vorgaben fur die schweizerische Klimapolitik , sagte Reich. Sollten die Klimaseniorinnen gewinnen, wurde das zunachst nur die Schweiz binden. Aber: Der EGMR mit Sitz im franzosischen Strassburg gehort zum Europarat und ist fur die Einhaltung der Menschenrechtskonvention zustandig. Zum Europarat gehoren die EU-Staaten, aber auch andere grosse Lander wie die Turkei oder Grossbritannien. Sprache sich dieses supranationale Gericht nun etwa fur strengere Vorgaben beim Klimaschutz aus, hatte das in jedem Fall grosse Signalwirkung. ,,Wenn generelle Aussagen getroffen wurden, dass Menschenrechte im Klimawandel Pflichten begrunden, mussen auch andere Vertragsstaaten der Europaischen Menschenrechtskonvention diese Art der Auslegung beachten , sagt Peters. Aber: Es sei schwierig, daraus fur Deutschland konkrete Politikempfehlungen abzuleiten. Diesbezuglich stehe den Staaten ein weiter Ermessensspielraum zu. Mit einem Urteil ist fruhestens im Herbst, wahrscheinlicher wohl aber erst im kommenden Jahr zu rechnen. Mit dem Vorentscheid, die Verhandlung und Anhorung vor der Grossen Kammer des Gerichtshofs durchzufuhren, wurde nach Ansicht der Klimaseniorinnen immerhin die grundlegende Bedeutung der Klagen unterstrichen. ,,Wir hoffen auf ein Leiturteil, dass Klimaschutz eine menschenrechtliche Frage ist und nicht nur auf eine blosse Absichtserklarung , sagte die Klimaseniorin Stefanie Brander der Deutschen Presse-Agentur. Klimapolitik durfe kein rechtsfreier Raum sein, wo jeder ,,vor sich hin wursteln darf , fugte Wydler-Walti hinzu. Google stellt kostenloses Klima-Werkzeug gegen Stadt-Uberhitzung vor  PantherMedia / Artinun Prekmoung  17.30 Uhr: Google wird mit neuen digitalen Werkzeugen Stadte und Gemeinden dabei unterstutzen, die negativen Folgen des Klimawandels abzumildern. So konne beispielsweise der Ausbau von Grunflachen in Grossstadten erleichtert werden, teilte die gemeinnutzige Abteilung von Google, Google.org, am Mittwoch mit. Mit dem Programm ,,Tree Canopy  (Baum-Baldachin) kombiniere man Kunstliche Intelligenz und Informationen aus Luftbildern, damit Stadte ihre Baumbestande einschatzen und deren Bewirtschaftung besser planen konnten. Die Tools werden von Google.org kostenlos zur Verfugung gestellt. Zum Start werden in Deutschland die Baumbestande in 17 Stadten erfasst - neben Berlin unter anderem in Heidelberg, Augsburg, Bremen, Dresden, Freiburg, Hamburg und Hannover. Weltweit sollen die Baumbestande in 350 Stadten ermittelt werden. ,,Tree Canopy  sei Teil von Bemuhungen, um Menschen und Stadte bei der Anpassung an extreme Hitze zu unterstutzen. Das Spektrum reiche von der Verfolgung von Waldbranden mit Satellitenbildern uber den Einsatz von maschinellem Lernen bis hin zur Verbesserung der Genauigkeit von Hochwasserwarnungen, sagte Google.org-Managerin Kate Brandt. Stadte suchten im Kampf gegen die Folgen des Klimawandels nach Moglichkeiten, ,,Hitzeinseln  zu verhindern, sagte Brandt. Eine Strategie zur Senkung der Temperaturen sei die Erhohung des Baumbestands in besonders betroffenen Gebieten. Das Land Berlin nutze bereits ,,Tree Canopy , um die Nachhaltigkeitspolitik, das Umweltmanagement und die Stadtplanung zu unterstutzen. Eine weitere Strategie zur Bekampfung von ,,Hitzeinseln  seien kuhlende Konstruktionen wie Dacher. ,,Kuhldacher reflektieren das Sonnenlicht und absorbieren weniger Warme.  Die nun vorgestellten Werkzeuge seien in der Lage, das Sonnenreflexionsvermogen von Stadten zu kartieren, sodass Stadtplaner und Regierungen feststellen konnten, welche Gebiete am meisten von Kuhldachern profitieren wurden. Australische Firma entwickelt Fleischballchen aus Mammut-Zellen 12.50 Uhr: Einem australischen Unternehmen ist es gelungen, ein Fleischballchen aus Mammut-Zellen herzustellen. Dafur verwendeten die Forschenden einen Mix aus Zellen von Schafen und Elefanten, denen konservierte Mammut-Zellen beigemischt wurden. Experimente mit Fleisch aus Zellkulturen gibt es bereits seit einiger Zeit. Vow geht insgesamt einen anderen Weg, indem es Zellen von unkonventionellen Arten wie Alpakas, Buffeln, Krokodilen, Kangurus, Pfauen und verschiedenen Fischarten untersucht hat, um neue Arten von Fleisch zu entwickeln. Mit dem Mammut-Fleischballchen will das australische Unternehmen zeigen, dass Fleischkonsum auch ohne Schlachtung moglich ist. Ausserdem will man so auf den Zusammenhang zwischen industrieller Viehzucht, der Zerstorung von Wildtieren und der Klimakrise aufmerksam machen. Noch ist das experimentelle Fleisch nicht auf dem Markt verfugbar. Mit der Aktion will Vow laut CEO George Peppou eine Anderung beim Fleischkonsum erwirken - weg von konventionellen Tierproteinen. Vow-Mitgrunder Tim Noakesmith sagte: ,,Wir haben das Mammut ausgewahlt, weil es ein Symbol fur den Verlust an Artenvielfalt und den Klimawandel ist.  Die Kreatur wurde durch die Jagd durch Menschen und die Erwarmung der Welt nach der letzten Eiszeit ausgerottet. Die Produktion von Fleisch in grossem Massstab, insbesondere von Rindfleisch, verursacht erhebliche Umweltschaden. Gezuchtetes Fleisch dagegen benotigt viel weniger Land und Wasser als Viehzucht und produziert keine Methanemissionen. Fur die Produktion soll laut Vow ausschliesslich Energie aus erneuerbaren Ressourcen benutzt worden sein. Europaischer Gerichtshof fur Menschenrechte befasst sich erstmals mit Klimaklagen Mittwoch, 29. Marz, 6.51 Uhr: Der Europaische Gerichtshof fur Menschenrechte (EGMR) in Strassburg befasst sich am Mittwoch ab 09.15 Uhr erstmals mit Klagen im Zusammenhang mit dem Klimawandel. Geklagt hat einerseits der Verein KlimaSeniorinnen Schweiz; die Seniorinnen sehen ihre Gesundheit durch die Erderwarmung und die steigenden Temperaturen besonders bedroht. Dem Gerichtshof liegt zudem eine Klima-Klage gegen Frankreich vor (ab 14.15 Uhr) - Klager ist ein fruherer Burgermeister aus einem Ort in Nordfrankreich, der durch den Anstieg des Meerespegels bedroht ist. In der offentlichen Anhorung geht es darum, ob und auf welche Art Menschenrechte die Staaten verpflichten, den Klimawandel aufzuhalten. Bei den KlimaSeniorinnen, die von der Umweltorganisation Greenpeace unterstutzt werden, handelt es sich um mehr als 2000 Frauen im Alter von uber 64 Jahren aus der Schweiz. Ein moglicher juristischer Sieg am Ende des Verfahrens konnte nach Einschatzung von Greenpeace die Klimapolitik in Europa und daruber hinaus beeinflussen. Ein Urteil wird erst in mehreren Monaten erwartet. Kohlemine recyclet Methan, um Hauser zu heizen Dienstag, 28. Marz, 12.50 Uhr: Bergbauwerke gelten als grosse Verursacher von schadlichen Emissionen. Der Kohleminenbetreiber Anglo American hat nun einen Weg gefunden, um diese Situation fur den Klimaschutz zu nutzen, wie ,,Bloomberg  berichtet. Umweltschutzer bezeichnen diese Vorgehensweise als richtungsweisend. In einer Kohlemine in Australien wird das austretende Methan aufgefangen, um einen Austritt in die Atmosphare zu verhindern - und um mit dem entstanden Brennstoff Hauser in der Umgebung zu heizen. Das Treibhausgas Methan wirkt uber einen Zeitraum von 20 Jahren, etwa 80 mal starker als Co2. Australien, das viel in den Bergbau investiert, hat sich mit anderen Landern geeinigt, die Methanemission bis 2030 um mindestens 30 Prozent unter das Niveau aus dem Jahr 2020 zu senken. Das Unternehmen schatzt, dass circa 42 Prozent des sonst austretenden Methans mit den Anlagen aufgefangen werden konnen. Das Unternehmen sieht darin eine Moglichkeit, klimabewusste Kunden und Investoren die Nutzung seiner Kohle schmackhaft zu machen. ,,Wenn man an eine langfristige Zukunft der Kohle fur die Stahlproduktion glaubt - und das tun wir - dann sind wir grundsatzlich der Meinung, dass wir ein verantwortungsvoller Betreiber dieser Anlage sein mussen , sagt Daniel vander Westhuizen, Geschaftsfuhrer von Anglo in Australien.

Last week, we at ESPNcricinfo did something we have been thinking of doing for eight years now: pretend-live ball-by-ball commentary for a classic cricket match. We knew the result, yes, but we tried our best to go in as ignorant about the actual match as possible, so as to react  naturally  to what was happening. The odd joke aside, we stayed in character and didn't let our knowledge of cricket's evolution since then inform our commentary.  However, we can break kayfabe now and talk about what we learnt from how cricket was back then, which in this case is the World Cup final of the year 1992.  Are we not calling wides?  Wide calls back then seemed to be based more on the umpires' judgement of the bowlers' intent than on how wide the ball was of the batsman's stumps. There were no tramlines for starters (yes, it is easy to forget such a time existed in limited-overs cricket). Quite regularly balls outside leg were not wided: be they wrong'uns starting from within the stumps, inswingers gone wrong, or full tosses outside leg from a left-arm spinner. Just as regularly, the umpires were too harsh on wides outside off.  The only explanation for this - other than it being a residue from amateur limited-overs cricket where umpires were lenient in order to complete matches before it got dark - is that they saw it as being the same as in Tests: nobody would intentionally bowl down the leg side, which would be bad bowling, but they might intentionally bowl wide outside off to restrict scoring. As a result, the bowlers had a much bigger margin for error if they bowled straight, but on the flip side, they couldn't use the space outside off tactically.  Wide calls are much less subjective today, except when the batsman has moved around in the crease or changed his stance before the ball has been delivered. The tramlines, introduced just as a guide, have now become an objective parameter in most cases. Going down leg is a strict no-no, but those tramline yorkers are fascinating to watch.  Who do I have to kill to get an lbw?  Yes, pitches have got flat, bats heavier, and rules are loaded in their favour, but to really appreciate modern batsmen, you have to watch a rerun - not highlights - of a 1992 World Cup game. Let alone getting a positive reaction from the umpires, the bowlers were so conditioned to receiving apathy that they didn't even appeal for lbws that were so plumb that even Virat Kohli might not have reviewed them. Batsmen back then hardly ever got out if they so much as got onto the front foot, and often they just pretended to play a shot if they were in trouble. Mad respect for modern batsmen.  White doesn't swing? Says who?  It is hard to believe but that was a time when the white ball swung more than the red one. This is not a view based on watching just one rerun; it is based on the first-hand experience of commentators and cricketers.  To make it worse for batsmen - and bowlers who struggled to control their swing - one new ball was used at each end in the 1992 World Cup. This is why teams, especially the winners, Pakistan, developed a strategy of batting the first 30 overs almost as if in a Test match. Imran Khan promoted himself to perform just that role. Bowlers struggled too: over the course of the tournament Wasim Akram, for example, went from being a quick bowler to trying to bowl within himself, to once more going all out when cutting the pace didn't have any impact on the wides.  It is amazing how we have a reached a stage where the same manufacturers are struggling to manufacture a ball that will swing.  The wrist is history: Mushtaq Ahmed's success in the 1992 World Cup heralded the age of the wristspinners * Getty Images  Non-strikers stole ground then too  In the 24th over of the chase, In the 24th over of the chase, Aamer Sohail pulled out of his delivery to warn Allan Lamb - who had just taken a quick couple the previous ball - against stealing ground before the ball was delivered. Boos punctuated the confused hush that fell over the MCG. Umpire Steve Bucknor called it a dead ball. Sohail ran in again, saw Lamb moving again and pulled out again. This time Bucknor had to intervene and break off a conversation between the two.  After the over, the transmission cut to the studio in Hong Kong. Sunil Gavaskar was the expert in the studio, weighing in with analysis and comments between overs and during drinks breaks. The anchor said,  Running a batsman out who has left the bowler's end is not considered cricket. You'd normally expect a warning first.  Not in limited-overs cricket, where every run is vital, said Gavaskar, whose tone suggested annoyance at Sohail being questioned.  The lines were being drawn already: Asian sides were much more serious about limited-overs cricket, and wanted the law enforced over the spirit. Later in the year, Kapil Dev would go on to run Peter Kirsten out after warnings, only for ugly scenes to play out thanks to South Africa's righteous indignation.  Imagine Gavaskar's and Dev's annoyance then, when 27 years later, exactly on the same day as that 1992 final, R Ashwin ran Jos Buttler out without a warning , only to be lambasted and ridiculed the world over. However, it is not a losing battle anymore, and people are beginning to realise the batsman is gaining an unfair advantage and needs to live with the consequences. Without a warning.  Wrist and reward  Pakistan were a horribly balanced side. They had a specialist batsman, Ijaz Ahmed, playing at No. 9, with his utility being only part-time seam-up overs. Sohail was called upon to bowl his full quota. Pakistan were a horribly balanced side. They had a specialist batsman, Ijaz Ahmed, playing at No. 9, with his utility being only part-time seam-up overs. Sohail was called upon to bowl his full quota. Imran Khan was injured, so he played mainly as a batsman whose job was to fast-forward the game to the 30th over without losing wickets. If other sides had slightly more urgency, they would have punished the bowling lightweights in the Pakistan side, but in one respect, Khan's team was also ahead of its time.  There was only one specialist wristspinner, and he wore the iconic light-green jersey. There was only one spinner in the top 19 wicket-takers in the tournament , and it was the same man, Mushtaq Ahmed . Khan insisted he wanted a legspinner in his side as Abdul Qadir reached the end of his career. Ahmed's impact was clear not just from his numbers but visibly too, with batsmen finding him as illegible as modern batsmen do left-arm wristspinners. Ahmed, the second highest wicket-taker of the tournament, was, as is known these days, the point of difference between others and the champion side.  The time was ripe for Shane Warne and Anil Kumble to rule the world.  Other lessons  Imran Khan could come to the toss wearing what looked like an undershirt and not be fined.  The world still didn't know much about reverse swing. The stage was set for a testy summer in England.  A bouncer above the head was a no-ball even if you touched it. Nowadays it is called a wide, and if you happen to play it, it becomes a legal delivery."}, {"source": "google-news", "title": "Fox News is 'big corporate machine that destroys people', says fired producer - The Guardian", "text": "A former Fox News producer suing the channel over her firing in relation to the $1.6bn Dominion Voter Systems defamation case said she was  bullied, intimidated and coerced  into avoiding fact-checks of Donald Trump's lies about voter fraud in the 2020 election.   They're a big corporate machine that destroys people,  Abby Grossberg told NBC.  Grossberg was speaking in an interview to be broadcast in full on NBC Nightly News on Thursday.  Asked why she said in a deposition in the case, given while at Fox News it was not her responsibility to fact-check whether what someone would say on air was true, Grossberg said it felt  awful  to do so.   It felt terrible because I knew that I was bullied, intimidated and coerced into saying that just to keep my job and stay at the company.   She added:  I made the decision to keep my job so that I could keep paying my bills. It seemed like the safer decision for me at the time.   Dominion wants Grossberg to testify in court next month in Delaware, alongside senior Fox executives including the 92-year-old owner, Rupert Murdoch, and his son Lachlan Murdoch.  Filings have revealed how Fox News executives and hosts did not believe Trump's claims of fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden but allowed hosts and guests to broadcast them anyway.  Fox News has accused Dominion of relying on  cherry-picked quotes without context to generate headlines .  Arguing that it was broadcasting newsworthy allegations reasonable viewers would have understood were not factual statements, the network has said:  The foundational right to a free press is at stake, and we will continue to fiercely advocate for the first amendment in protecting the role of news organisations to cover the news.   In response to a request for comment about Grossberg's claims, Fox News said:  The assertion that Ms Grossberg was coached or intimidated into being dishonest during her Dominion deposition is patently false.

Russia's main security service, the FSB, claimed Thursday that Evan Gershkovich, a correspondent based in Moscow, had been trying to obtain state secrets. The Wall Street Journal categorically rejected those allegations, saying in a statement that it  vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter.   Almar Latour, the chief executive of Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal, condemned Gershkovich's arrest in a memo to staffers Thursday, which was obtained by CNN, saying the company is working  around the clock  to secure his release.  This is an incredibly disturbing development,  Latour said.  A Russian district court in Moscow said Thursday that Gershkovich would be detained until May 29.  It is the first time an American journalist has been detained on accusations by Moscow of spying since the Cold War. It comes a week after US authorities announced charges against a Russian national, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, accusing him of being a Russian spy.  The Kremlin did not comment when asked if Gershkovich's arrest was a tit-for-tat move related to Cherkasov, who is currently incarcerated in Brazil on fraud charges, according to the US Department of Justice. Asked by CNN during a daily briefing Thursday if Gershkovich's arrest was a  retaliatory measure  for the charges against Cherkasov, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov replied:  I do not have such information. I have nothing to say on this topic.   John Kirby, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, declined to weigh in on reports Gershkovich's detention may be a retaliatory move, telling reporters Thursday that the US was still trying to gather information.  But Kirby did acknowledge the challenges facing journalists in Moscow, saying that while the administration respects that reporters in Russia face risks  it doesn't change our deep concern about Americans being in Russia.  He reiterated a warning to Americans to avoid traveling to the country.  The FSB said Gershkovich was detained in Yekaterinburg, on the eastern side of the Ural mountains, and claimed he was  trying to obtain secret information  relating to  the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.   The FSB said the reporter, who is accredited by Russia's foreign ministry, was  acting on the instructions of the American side.   The US State Department began tracking Gershkovich's arrest Wednesday afternoon before the news broke publicly, according to two US officials. The US government was first informed of his arrest by The Wall Street Journal, according to another US official.  The State Department and White House said their officials had spoken with The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday night about Gershkovich's arrest, and that President Biden was briefed. The Biden administration has been in contact with his family, and the State Department has reached out to the Russian side, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement Thursday.   The State Department has been in direct touch with the Russian government on this matter, including actively working to secure consular access to Mr. Gershkovich,  Jean-Pierre said.  The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest terms.   Consular access could take several days,  due to Russia's administrative procedures and security requirements,  Vedant Patel, State Department principal deputy spokesperson, said in a briefing Thursday. He also said that the US Embassy in Moscow had requested official notification of Gershkovich's arrest, which is required under bilateral consular convention.  Asked by CNN if the State Department would designate Gershkovich as wrongfully detained, Patel said that he did not want to get ahead of the process, but that he did not believe there was any truth to the charges against the journalist.  Earlier, Russia's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Yevgeny Ivanov said that the US had not formally approached the Russian Federation about Gershkovich's case, state news agency TASS reported.  Gershkovich covers Russia, Ukraine and the former Soviet Union, according to his biography on the Wall Street Journal's website. He previously worked for news agency Agence France-Presse, the Moscow Times and the New York Times.  Detained Americans  Detentions of other Americans have led to lengthy and difficult negations between Washington and Moscow.  US basketball star Brittney Griner, detained in February 2022 on what the US described as trumped-up drug smuggling charges, was released in December in a prisoner swap for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.  However, the US did not secure the release of another American, Paul Whelan. Whelan, a former Marine who is a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison in 2020 after a trial US officials called unfair.   Our family is sorry to hear that another American family will have to experience the same trauma that we have had to endure for the past 1,553 days,  Paul's brother David Whelan said in an email to the press on Thursday.  Unfortunately, the White House does not seem to have found a way to resolve cases like Paul's, where an American is falsely charged with espionage by the Kremlin.   The US has continued campaigning for Paul Whelan's release. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this month that a  serious proposal  had been put to Kremlin officials. But David said that he had  started to wonder whether Paul's case really is a priority,  while other Americans have been free, adding that he hoped Paul and Gershkovich would be able to return to their families soon.  State Department spokesperson Patel said that Whelan's case remained an  absolute priority,  and that it was important not to  make comparisons  between Whelan and Gershkovich's cases. Patel added that the US Embassy would be speaking with Whelan on Thursday, and consular officers last visited him in person in late January.  Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told TASS on Thursday that it was premature to raise the possibility of a prisoner exchange for Gershkovich.  Meanwhile, US lawmakers referred to his detention as a  hostage-taking  and  kidnapping,  saying that it is yet another attempt by Russia to ramp up pressure on the West, following a series of ominous declarations by Putin referencing his nuclear arsenal.  Putin last week said Moscow plans to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus. While there's no guarantee he will follow through with the plan, the statement sparked concern in the West, coming hot on the heels of Putin announcing that Russia would suspend participation in the New START treaty, a key nuclear arms reduction agreement.  Florida Congressman Jared Moskowitz and California Congressman Adam Schiff described the detention of Evan Gershkovich on espionage charges as a  kidnapping,  with Moskowitz telling CNN,  we are in very dangerous territory with [Putin]. This is all about leverage and so now we have a human life in the balance.   Moskowitz, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said  this is not the game that Putin should be playing. I think Joe Biden has shown that he's not someone who's going to be toyed with when it comes to these sort of things,  adding Gershkovich  should be released immediately.   Schiff, the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN that this latest move should be seen  in concert with their nuclear announcements, the abrogation of their treaty obligations, as a way of just ramping up pressure on the West, signaling that Moscow's going to use whatever tools it has, including essentially hostage-taking, to try to deter the United States and the west from opposing its ambitions in Ukraine.   Gershkovich's detention also marks a significant stepping up of Russia's campaign against foreign media.  Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin made it a crime to disseminate  fake  information about the Russian army and the invasion of Ukraine. That prompted global news organizations including CNN to temporarily suspend broadcasting from the country.  Russian foreign ministry's spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Thursday that Gershkovich's arrest was  not related to his journalism,  claiming without evidence that he used his press visa and accreditation as cover for other activity.  I'm now reading a lot of reports in the Western media saying that he had accreditation from the Foreign Ministry, therefore he's a journalist. No, no, no. This is what he claimed to be,  she said.  Gershkovich is the first journalist to be accused of spying by Russia since 1986, when reporter Nick Daniloff was detained on a similar charge while working for the U.S. News and World Report newspaper and magazine. He spent weeks in a Russian prison before the Reagan administration negotiated his release.  Speaking at a press conference after his release in 1986, Daniloff called it a  very complex situation,  stressing that without President Reagan's  very deep and personal interest  in his case he would have likely been imprisoned for much longer.  In my case, the FBI had arrested a Soviet in New York for espionage, and the Russians then arrested me,  Daniloff told CNN. He added that negotiation eventually secured his release, involving a  solution for the guy who was arrested in New York.   The National Press Club on Thursday called on Russia to immediately release Gershkovich, calling his detention  unjust,  and also urged action from the State Department.   Evan Gershkovich is a journalist. He should be released immediately and unharmed and allowed to return to his important work,  said Eileen O'Reilly, president of the National Press Club, and Gil Klein, journalism president of the National Press Club, in a statement.  The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, condemned Gershkovich's detention and Russia's crackdown on the free press Thursday, saying on Twitter:  Journalists must be allowed to exercise their profession freely and deserve protection. The Russian authorities demonstrate yet again their systematic disregard for media freedom.   Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that the US announced charges against a Russian national, Sergey Vladimirovich Cherkasov, but did not arrest him.

Bob Freeman, D-Nashville, has struggled to find the words this week as his district, and the city at large, reels from the deadliest school shooting in state history that left three children and three staff dead on Monday.  Freeman grappled with the tragedy as an elected official and as a father, as his young daughter attended the same Sunday school class as one of the Covenant School victims.   What's the right way to help a child grieve the loss of a friend and the loss of innocence?  Freeman asked his House colleagues.   Parents dropped their kids off on a beautiful spring morning with no idea their lives would forever be changed at a moment of senseless gun violence.   For more than a thousand people on Thursday morning, their response to the Covenant shooting led them up the steps of the Tennessee Capitol and into its halls, where they crowded into its marble rotunda and lined the chamber galleries.  As their chants for  gun reform now  rang out, Tennessee Highway Patrol members were forced to hold open paths for lawmakers and staff to get into the House chamber, which eventually erupted in an unprecedented confrontation sparked by two freshman lawmakers urging their colleagues to address gun safety issues before returning to business as usual.  Freeman called for  common-sense reforms  including red flag laws and background checks. Freeman addressed his Republican supermajority colleagues, who in recent years have relaxed gun laws in the state.   Our children, our teachers and our neighbors were killed by a weapon of war obtained legally by someone that should never have had the ability to carry out this type of violence against our community,  Freeman said.  Freeman urged his colleagues to listen to the crowd waiting outside the House doors.   They're out there right now. They're begging for us to do something,  Freeman said.  More:A timeline of Covenant School shooting in Nashville: What we know  Senate speaker Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, said Thursday he would support red flag laws, in addition to increasing security measures at school. House leadership would not commit to supporting or opposing gun reforms floated by their Democratic colleagues, but leadership said they would be open to discussing any options to keep Tennessee children safe.   We'll be happy to have everything on the table and have a conversation,  House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, said.  Young people flock to Capitol to call for gun reform  Sarah Braam, Davern Cigarran, Alexine Stewart and Sullivan Strobel, all juniors at Harpeth Hall School, huddled together ahead of the protest.   We're like one of several car-fulls coming,  Braam said.  Our dean said we could have an excused absence to be here today.   Junior year is a busy time in a high schooler's career getting ready for the next steps in their lives, but all four girls felt it was vitally important to represent children their age at the Capitol Thursday.   I feel like it's an issue that needs to be seriously addressed,  Cigarran said.  I also feel like the Covenant shooting is something that impacted a lot of people in our community very directly. I think this is something that can't just be, you know, ignored or protested for four days and then forgotten about.   Emotions ran high in the crowd inside the Capitol, where protestors filed through security checkpoints before floor sessions Thursday morning. Though there was a brief moment where Tennessee Highway Patrol pulled a protestor out of the crowd as a lawmaker attempted to return to House chamber, there were no other altercations with security and protestors remained in areas open to the public.  McNally calls for school security changes, would support red flag law  In a letter to Gov. Bill Lee, McNally called for increased school security measures in response to the Covenant shooting. Leadership met with the governor on Wednesday, House leadership said.   While these changes would come with a cost, I believe it is important for us to have a conversation about how to increase and modernize security at schools in Tennessee,  McNally said.  Much like the institution of fire codes has decreased the amount of school building fires, I believe we can come up with something similar for school safety.   McNally said he would be supportive of red flag laws, though he signaled not all of his colleagues would agree.   In my opinion, states like Florida that have red flag laws, that's something that I would support,  McNally said.  Provided there is protection from false reporting.   McNally pointed to the Covenant shooter's access of the school by shooting through glass doors at a side entrance vestibule, calling for securing windows and glass with  bullet proof or resistant  film.  McNally also called for magnetic locks on doors to ease first responder access to building doors that might be locked down in an emergency, in addition to  centralized and modernized camera systems.   The speaker also called for an armed guard at every public and private school. Tennessee public schools currently have access to school resource officers.  Democratic House Minority Leader Karen Camper, D-Memphis, said  there's an opportunity for the Republican supermajority to in fact do something.    The people are screaming and shouting out for us to do something about it, and we can do it right now,  Camper said.  Tempers high in House  Even as the crowds continued to chant outside, the House moved on to its lengthy Thursday agenda, which included bills delayed on Monday when lawmakers chose to pause floor debates hours after the Covenant shooting.  The House floor descended into chaos later in the morning, after Sexton repeatedly gaveled down members of the public in the gallery, and two outspoken freshman Democrats who continually called for colleagues to address gun reform.   I'm asking you to do your job,  one woman screamed from the gallery.  There is blood on your hands. Do your job.   After butting heads with Rep. Justin Pearson, D-Memphis, and Rep. Justin Jones, D-Nashville, Sexton called all leadership up to the dais. As leaders of both the Republican and Democratic caucuses engaged in heated discussions, Pearson and Jones took over the House chamber well.  The pair, flanked by Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, began leading the House galleries in chants of  gun reform now.   They later walked off the House floor after a heated confrontation with their own Democratic leadership. The House resumed its regular calendar, though Republicans pushed back on some otherwise non-controversial Democratic bills.  Pearson and Jones could face potential sanctions for the incident moving forward.   What is not okay is for members to try to take over the House and start something inside this chamber.

The massive GOP bill up would sharply increase domestic production of oil, natural gas and coal, and ease permitting restrictions that delay pipelines, refineries and other projects. It also would boost production of critical minerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt that are used in products such as electric vehicles, computers and cellphones.  The vote to pass the bill, dubbed the  Lower Energy Costs Act,  was 225 to 204. One Republican voted against the measure.  Republicans gave the bill the symbolic label H.R. 1 -- the top legislative priority of the new GOP majority, which took control of the House in January. The measure, which combines dozens of separate proposals, represents more than two years of work by Republicans who have chafed at Mr. Biden's environmental agenda. They said Mr. Biden's efforts have thwarted U.S. energy production and increased costs at the gas pump and grocery store.   Families are struggling because of President Biden's war on American energy,  said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana, one of the bill's main authors.  We have way too many energy resources here in America to be relying on hostile nations and paying [high prices] at the pump.''  The GOP bill will  unleash those resources so we can produce energy in America,  Scalise said.  We don't have to be addicted to foreign countries that don't like us.   Democrats called the bill a giveaway to big oil companies.   Republicans refuse to hold polluters accountable for the damage they cause to our air, our water, our communities and our climate,  said New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.   While Democrats delivered historic wins for the American people by passing historic climate legislation, Republicans are actively working to undermine that progress and do the bidding of their polluter friends,  Pallone said.  Mr. Biden has threatened to veto the energy bill if it reaches his desk, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York called it  dead on arrival  in the Democratic-controlled Senate.  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the GOP bill  restores American energy leadership by repealing unnecessary taxes and overregulation on American energy producers,  and  makes it easier to build things in America  by placing a two-year time limit on environmental reviews that now take an average of seven years.   Every time we need a pipeline, a road or a dam, it gets held up five to seven years and adds millions of dollars in costs for the project to comply with Washington's permitting process,  McCarthy said in speech on the House floor.  It's too long, it's unaffordable, it's not based on science and it's holding us back.   Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy leaves a House Republican meeting at the Capitol on March 28, 2023, in Washington, D.C. Kevin Dietsch / Getty Images  He pointed to a project to modify and improve Lake Isabella Dam in his central California district that has lasted 18 years and still is not completed.   Permitting reform isn't for everyone,  McCarthy added.  If you like paying more at the pump, you don't want to make it faster for American workers to build more pipelines. If you're China, you'd rather America sit back and let others lead. And if you're a bureaucrat, maybe you really do enjoy reading the 600-page environmental impact studies.   Most Americans want lower prices and more U.S. energy production, McCarthy said -- results he said the bill will deliver.  Democrats called that misleading and said the GOP plan was a thinly disguised effort to reward oil companies and other energy producers that have contributed millions of dollars to GOP campaigns.  Arizona Rep. Raul Grijalva, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, derided the bill as the  Polluters Over People Act  and  a nearly 200-page love letter to polluting industries.   Instead of reining in  Big Oil  companies that have reported record profits while  hoarding thousands of unused leases  on public lands and waters, the GOP bill lowers royalty rates paid by energy producers and reinstates noncompetitive leasing of public lands, Grijalva said.  The bill also gives mining companies  a veritable free-for-all on our public lands  and  makes mockery of tribal consultation  required under federal law, he said.  Under the GOP plan, mining companies would  destroy sacred and special places  throughout the West,  ruin the landscape and leave behind a toxic mess that pollutes our water and hurts our health -- all without paying a cent to the American people,  Grijalva said.  Schumer called the measure  a giveaway to Big Oil pretending to be an energy package.   The House energy package  would gut important environmental safeguards on fossil fuel projects,  locking America  into expensive, erratic and dirty energy sources while setting us back more than a decade on our transition to clean energy,  Schumer said.  Schumer said he supports streamlining the nation's cumbersome permitting process for energy projects, especially those that will deliver  clean energy  such as wind, solar and geothermal power.  But the Republican plan falls woefully short on this front as well,  he said, calling on Republicans to back reforms that would help ease the transition to renewable energy and accelerate construction of transmission lines to bolster the nation's aging power grid.  Schumer and other Democrats said the Republican bill would repeal a new $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and other parts of the climate and health care law passed by Democrats last year. The bill also would eliminate a new tax on methane pollution."}, {"source": "google-news", "title": "New census estimates show more population loss in St. Louis city and metro area - St. Louis Post-Dispatch", "text": "ST. LOUIS -- New U.S. Census Bureau estimates show St. Louis continuing a decades-long population slide while St. Charles County and other outer suburban areas keep growing.  But the gains in outer-rim areas weren't enough to keep the overall metro area from losing an estimated 11,000-plus residents from July 2021 to July 2022, the period covered by the report released late Wednesday.  According to the new estimates, the city's population dropped 2.38%, to 286,578 from 293,562. St. Louis County's total went down by 0.78%, to 990,414 from 998,227.  Farther west, St. Charles County increased by 0.8%, to 413,803. Jefferson, Franklin, Lincoln and Warren counties also gained, with Lincoln showing the biggest percentage increase, 2.43%.  But the total for the overall area, including 14 counties and the city of St. Louis, was down 0.4%, to 2,801,319.  Jason Hall, the CEO of Greater St. Louis Inc. -- the area's main business group -- said  these numbers give a clear indication of the challenge our region faces and underscore why growth and expanded opportunity  need to be the major goal.   We must do this work now, with a sense of urgency, in order to win this decade and reverse these trends by 2030.   Ness Sandoval, a sociologist at St. Louis University, said the estimates came as no surprise, given recent trends.   I think it's about what we expected,  Sandoval said.  There's nothing inconsistent in these estimates  and what's happened the past few years.  He said he expects further details will show that the number of deaths will again outpace births here, as they did for the first time in the most recent previous population estimates released a year ago.  That's going to tell us the larger story,  he said.  Jim Wild, executive director of the regional East-West Gateway Council of Governments, said the size of the losses in the city and St. Louis County were larger than he expected but that the area-wide data tracked with previous information.   Over the last couple of decades, we've been a slow-growth region,  Wild said.  Scott Drachnik, president and CEO of the Economic Development Council of St. Charles County, said while the new estimates showed his county doing well, the entire region needs to prosper.   As a region, we've got to find a way to turn this around,  he said.  We welcome anyone who wants to come to St. Charles County but we want to see growth around the region and across the state.   The new estimates indicated Missouri's population essentially was static, growing by just 8,134 people to about 6.18 million.  Going in the other direction was Illinois, which the Census Bureau said had a net loss of more than 104,000 residents last year, to 12.58 million.  The two biggest Metro East counties, St. Clair and Madison, both lost population, by 0.92% and 0.39% respectively.  2022 POPULATION ESTIMATES COUNTY 2021 2022 Change Bond County, Ill. 16,633 16,566 -0.40% Calhoun County, Ill. 4,385 4,360 -0.57% Clinton County, Ill. 36,886 36,909 0.06% Franklin County, Mo. 105,328 105,879 0.52% Jefferson County, Mo. 227,934 229,336 0.62% Jersey County, Ill. 21,370 21,246 -0.58% Lincoln County, Mo. 61,654 63,155 2.43% Macoupin County, Ill. 44,545 44,245 -0.67% Madison County, Ill. 264,898 263,864 -0.39% Monroe County, Ill. 34,993 35,033 0.11% St. Charles County, Mo. 410,511 413,803 0.80% St. Clair County, Ill. 255,022 252,671 -0.92% St. Louis City, Mo. 293,562 286,578 -2.38% St. Louis County, Mo. 998,227 990,414 -0.78% Warren County, Mo. 36,529 37,260 2.00% St. Louis MSA 2,812,477 2,801,319 -0.40%"}, {"source": "argaam", "title": "rtf` 'rbH mk@ l~ 104 mlyyn ryl bnhy@ lsn@ lmly@ lqSyr@ mn ywnyw l~ dysmbr 2022 (ftr@ st@ 'shhr w'rb`@ `shr ywman)", "text": "rtf`t 'rbH mk@ llnsh, lty t`ml fy lstthmr l`qry fy mk@ lmkrm@ l~ 104 mlyyn ryl bnhy@ lsn@ lmly@ lqSyr@ lmnthy@ tbd' mn 2022/06/14m wtnthy btrykh 2022/12/31m, mqrn@ b'rbH 56 mlywn ryl tm tHqyqh mqrn@ bftr@ st@ 'shhr wthlth@ `shr ywman mn nfs l`m.  qlt lshrk@ n sbb rtf` l'rbH -

The Washington Post", "text": "Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share  Narrated audio | Listen 10 min  Conservative commentators and Republican politicians unleashed a new wave of anti-trans rhetoric following Monday's shooting at a Nashville Christian school that killed six people, escalating a broader backlash to the rising visibility of transgender people in public life. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The attempts on the right to connect violence to transgender people come even though transgender people are rarely the perpetrators of mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly carried out by cisgender men, according to criminal justice experts. And trans people are more likely to be victims of violence than cisgender people, multiple studies have shown.  In Nashville, the shooter's gender identity and motive remain unclear: police initially said the shooter Audrey Hale was a 28-year-old woman, and then later said Hale was transgender, citing a social media profile in which Hale used masculine pronouns. The Post has not yet confirmed how Hale identified.  At a vigil on March 29 in Nashville, Police Chief John Drake spoke about the emotional toll of the Covenant School shooting that killed six people. (Video: Reuters)  Nevertheless, Fox News host Tucker Carlson featured a photo of the shooter superimposed with the words  Trans Killer  on his Tuesday show. The chyron read:  We are witnessing the rise of trans violence.   Advertisement  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) speculated on Twitter, as well as during a congressional hearing Wednesday, that hormone treatment may have played a role in the shooting, even though there is no evidence the shooter was on hormone therapy.  And former president Donald Trump on Wednesday, without evidence, also connected the Nashville shooting to hormone therapy and  the anger that was caused  during an interview with conservative talk radio host John Fredericks. Trump said he banned transgender people from serving in the military because  the amount of drugs they have to take is so incredible,  even though research and surveys show most transgender people do not undergo hormone therapy.  Studies examining the effects of testosterone therapy on aggression in transgender men have produced mixed results, with one review of scientific literature finding impacts on aggression would be short-term and concluding that more research is needed because available studies lack randomization and rely on self-reporting.  Advertisement  The attacks against transgender people and gender-affirming care come at a precarious time for trans rights in America.   This has fit into their existing narrative presenting trans people as dangerous criminals, presenting gender affirming care as inherently dangerous, and it's very alarming to see them turn this up to 11,  said Ari Drennen, a trans woman who monitors anti-trans rhetoric in conservative media as LGBTQ program director for Media Matters of America, a liberal watchdog group.  I didn't really think it was possible to escalate from implying we are pedophiles, but we are seeing this escalate into people calling trans people violent terrorists.   At least 38 transgender people were killed last year and 50 were slain in 2021, according to tracking by the Human Rights Campaign. As #TransTerrorism trends on Twitter this week, LGBTQ advocates expressed concerns that anti-trans rhetoric in the wake of the Nashville shooting, which killed three children, will buoy a blitz of anti-trans bills in state legislatures to restrict access to gender-affirming medical care for both minors and adults.  Advertisement  At the Colorado Capitol, a resident testifying Tuesday against a bill to offer legal protections to out-of-state visitors seeking gender-affirming care invoked the Nashville shooter to contend that children  being manipulated by the transgender movement are confused and angry.   While appearing Tuesday on Laura Ingraham's prime time show on Fox News to discuss the Nashville shooting and  hate crimes  against Christians, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) criticized gender affirming care as mutilating children, adding:  All of this goes back to the fact, Laura, that we've got to get the facts here in this shooting, we've got to prevent this from happening again, we've got to tell the truth about what happened in Nashville.   Others argued that the public focus should be on trans people, rather than guns.  Advertisement  Donald Trump Jr. on Monday night tweeted:  maybe, rather than talking about guns we should be talking about lunatics pushing their gender affirming bulls--- on our kids?  He followed up with a Tuesday tweet that said  there's a clear epidemic of trans/non-binary mass shooters.   Conservative commentator Matt Walsh, one of the most fervent anti-trans activists on the right, called the  gender ideology movement  the  most hateful and violent movement in America  on a Wednesday podcast episode entitled  Christian children murdered by trans mass shooter.  On Monday night he tweeted that  left wing trans extremists are violent, dangerous people.   Advertisement  Since 2006, 96 percent of 340 mass killings involving a single shooter were committed by men, according to a Washington Post analysis of a database maintained by Northeastern University, the Associated Press and USA Today.   This is a cisgender male phenomenon, by and large,  said Eric Madfis, an associate professor of criminal justice at the University of Washington at Tacoma, who has studied the gender dynamics of school shootings.  Madfis says researchers are interested in how masculinity influences shooters who are women or transgender. But transgender perpetrators of mass killings remain rare.   You can't use it to stigmatize and punish a whole community,  Madfis said.  This is not a good-faith effort at trying to address school shootings and mass shootings. This is a cynical, bigoted attack.   Advertisement  Right-wing activists have previously blamed mass shootings in Highland Park, Ill., and Uvalde, Tex., on transgender people, without evidence. Conservatives also noted that defense lawyers identified the suspect in a mass shooting at an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs last year as nonbinary, and a friend described a person who killed three in Maryland in 2018 as transgender.  Researchers say the other instances are not reason to suggest transgender people are more prone to violence than cisgender people. The Pew Research Center estimates 1.6 percent of the U.S. population identifies as trans or nonbinary.  LGBTQ organizations said the increased bigotry is putting trans people at greater risk.   We know that the onslaught of rhetoric against our community is directly harming the mental and emotional health of our community,  Ash Orr, a spokesperson for the National Center for Transgender Equality, said in a statement.  There is a vocal minority of people who try to stoke fear of what they don't understand, who label trans people as 'other' and tell us we don't belong. Because of this, trans people, especially trans women of color, face very real threats and violence.   Studies show transgender people are disproportionately likely to be victims of violence.  Advertisement  Transgender people are four times more likely than cisgender people to be the victims of crimes including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, a think tank that focuses on LGBTQ issues. The study relied on the 2017 and 2018 National Crime Victimization Survey, a comprehensive source of data that includes gender identity.   It is a consistent finding that trans people have a high prevalence of experiencing violent victimization,  said Jody Herman, a senior scholar at the Williams Institute and co-author of the study.  A recent Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll of transgender and nonbinary adults, the largest nongovernmental survey of U.S. transgender adults to rely on random sampling method, showed the risks of violence they face. One in 4 trans adults say they have been physically attacked because of their gender identity, gender expression or sexual identity, and more than 6 in 10 (64 percent) say they have been verbally attacked.  Advertisement  Rebecca Stotzer, who has extensively studied violence against transgender people, said her research challenged stereotypes that trans people are mostly attacked by intimate partners.   Violence can come from all sources in a transgender person's life, from families, friends, acquaintances and strangers,  said Stotzer, a professor at the University of Hawaii's Thompson School of Social Work and Public Health.

CBC News", "text": "Two Black Hawk helicopters crashed during a routine training mission Wednesday night in Trigg County, Ky., leaving nine people dead, according to a U.S. army spokesperson.  Nine people were killed in a crash involving two Black Hawk medical evacuation helicopters conducting a nighttime training exercise in Kentucky, U.S. army officials said Thursday.  Nondice Thurman, a spokesperson for Fort Campbell, said the deaths occurred on Wednesday night in southwestern Kentucky during a routine training mission.  A statement from Fort Campbell said the two HH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, part of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed at about 10 p.m. local time on Wednesday in Trigg County, Ky. The 101st Airborne confirmed the crash about 50 kilometres northwest of Fort Campbell. The crash is under investigation.  The helicopters crashed in a field near a residential area with no injuries on the ground, Brig.-Gen. John Lubas, the 101st Airborne deputy commander, said. One helicopter had five people aboard and the other had four, he said.  An army spokesperson declined to comment on whether the helicopters collided in the air.   At this time, there is no determination on the specifics regarding the accident,  Daniel Matthews, a public affairs officer for the 101st Airborne Division, said in an emailed statement on Thursday afternoon. Matthews said an aviation safety team from Fort Rucker, Ala., will investigate the accident.  Speaking a news conference on Thursday morning, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the state would do everything it can to support the families of those killed.   We're going to do what we always do: We're going to wrap our arms around these families, we're going to be with them, not just for the days, but for the weeks and days to come,  he said.  Cause unknown  Lubas, the deputy commander, said it is unclear what caused the crash.   This was a training progression, and specifically they were flying a multi-ship formation, two ships, under night vision goggles at night,  he said.  Lubas added that officials believe the accident occurred when  they were doing flying, not deliberate medical evacuation drills.   Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, right, and military officials hold a news conference in Fort Campbell, Ky., on Thursday after the helicopter crash. (Sharon Johnson/The Associated Press)  The helicopters have something similar to the black boxes on passenger planes, which record the performance of aircraft in flight and are used by investigators to analyze crashes.   We're hopeful that will provide quite a bit of information of what occurred,  Lubas said.  The Black Hawk helicopter is a critical workhorse for the U.S. army and is used in security, transport, medical evacuations, search and rescue and other missions. The helicopters are known to many people from the 2001 movie Black Hawk Down, which is about a violent battle in Somalia eight years earlier.  Black Hawks were a frequent sight in the skies over Iraq and Afghanistan during wars there, conducting combat missions, and they're also used by the army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. They were also often used to ferry visiting senior leaders to headquarters in the Iraq and Afghanistan war zones.  'Fireball' seen by witness  Fort Campbell is located near the Tennessee border, about 100 kilometres northwest of Nashville, and the crash occurred in the community of Cadiz, in Trigg County, Ky.  Nick Tomaszewski, who lives about a mile from where the crash occurred, said he saw two helicopters flying over his house moments before the crash.   For whatever reason, last night my wife and I were sitting there looking out on the back deck and I said, 'Wow, those two helicopters look low and they look kind of close to one another tonight,'  he said.

(Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images)  The helicopters flew over and looped back around, and moments later  we saw what looked like a firework went off in the sky.    All of the lights in their helicopter went out. It was like they just poofed ... and then we saw a huge glow like a fireball,  Tomaszewski said.  Flyovers for training exercises happen almost daily, and the helicopters typically fly low but not so close together, he said.   There were two back to back. We typically see one and then see another one a few minutes later, and we just saw two of them flying together last night,  Tomaszewski said.  U.S. Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin offered his condolences to the families of those killed.   My heart goes out to the families of these service members and to the members of the 101st Airborne Division who bravely and proudly serve our country each and every day,  Austin said in a statement.  In the Kentucky House and in the Senate, members stood for a moment of silence on Thursday morning in honour of the crash victims. Kentucky state Rep. Walker Thomas said the crash occurred about 15 to 20 minutes from his home.   They're there to protect us,  Thomas said.  And we're constantly seeing these helicopters flying over our communities.

This week's federal budget says the Canada Revenue Agency will also present a plan in 2024 to expand the service, following consultations with stakeholders and community organizations.  The move toward automatic tax filing, first promised in the 2020 speech from the throne, is one of several budget measures the Liberals say are meant to help Canadians with the cost of living.  Experts and advocates have called for automatic filing, noting many vulnerable Canadians miss out on benefits to which they are entitled.

The federal budget also said the Canada Revenue Agency will expand access to a service set up in 2018 that allows some Canadians with lower or fixed incomes to auto-file simple returns over the telephone.

The comments were made at an announcement in Hamilton, Ont., where the premier was re-announcing a 2023 budget commitment to hire more nurses.  When asked about the shortfall, Ford said officials should be  driving efficiencies  and  focusing on lean practices.    They can't just go there and think the taxpayer is going to constantly bail him out no matter if it's the municipal, provincial or federal government,  he said.  They have to start treating Toronto like they're spending their own money, then we'll see a big change.   Toronto officials said earlier this week that significant cuts to services and state-of-good repair work may be necessary in 2024 after both the federal government and the province refused to inject significant funds into municipalities.  Speaking to reporters ahead of the April city council meeting, Deputy Mayor Jennifer McKelvie said Toronto was still  very much in the mode of recovery  following the pandemic.   You're going to see those cuts rapidly happen in 2024,  she said.   If we don't get assistance, we are able to use the reserves we've squirreled away to pay for this year. But it's not a good strategy...it's like taking out your RRSPs to pay your mortgage, or to pay your groceries. It's not sustainable.   Without aide from other governments, the city is looking at a nearly $1 billion shortfall. McKelvie suggested the city could make up some of that revenue by raising property taxes.  The city also has to take a freezing of development fees into consideration when addressing budgetary concerns. As part of Ford's housing strategy, some development charges--which are collected by cities to help pay for the cost of municipal services or infrastructure such as roads and transit--will be eliminated or significantly reduced for certain builders.  A staff report indicated this could result in a loss of about $230 million in revenue for Toronto alone.  In the Ontario budget, which was released last week, the province did not provide municipalities with additional funding to help offset either COVID-19 or housing revenue losses. Instead, it committed $48 million in funding for Toronto's supportive housing costs. Finance Minister Peter Bethlenfalvy said this was the city's  top request.   The mayor's office has not confirmed whether this funding was a  top request,  saying instead it was a  key funding ask  made by former Mayor John Tory and McKelvie directly to the province.  The funding is part of a larger pledge the Progressive Conservative's made to provide an additional $202 million each year to the Homeless Prevention Program and Indigenous Supportive Housing Program.  The federal government, for its part, provided municipalities with funding in 2020 and 2021 to offset COVID-19 shortfalls. There was no new funding in the 2023 budget."}, {"source": "google-news-ca", "title": "Nova Scotia attacks: police heavily criticised for failures in Canada's deadliest mass shooting - The Guardian", "text": "A cascade of failures within Canada's federal police worsened the country's deadliest mass shooting, a public inquiry has concluded, in a damning indictment that found the force has shown little interest in reforming in the years since.  The Mass Casualty Commission, a joint provincial and federal inquiry, was investigating the 2020 shootings in Portapique Nova Scotia, in which a gunman driving a fake police car spent more than 13 hours evading capture and killing 22 people.  The commission released its final report on Thursday, detailing the fixes to the systemic deficiencies within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) that are needed to restore trust in policing and to prevent another national tragedy, as well as the pressing need to address the root causes of violence.  While the report conceded that officers deployed as first responders had little idea what they were arriving to, the RCMP nonetheless  fail[ed] to publicly share accurate and timely information  with the public, worsening the tragedy.  In one example, RCMP-issued mobile phones had no data, so officers unfamiliar with the area used their personal phones to navigate in the dark.  Despite the first three emergency calls identifying the shooter, Gabriel Wortman, by name and saying he was driving a near-perfect replica of an RCMP vehicle, officers on the ground were never passed that information, and instead assumed the shooter was driving a decommissioned vehicle with old decals.  A woman pays her respects to the victims of the mass shooting at a roadside memorial on Portapique Road in Portapique, Nova Scotia Photograph: Andrew Vaughan/AP  Amid the chaos of burning buildings and numerous homicides, police tweeted they were responding to a  firearms complaint , a message the commission said  in no way conveyed the threat presented by the perpetrator at that time .  Police didn't send out another message to the public until the next morning. Police had access to an emergency alert system in place, but senior RCMP officers told the commission they believed it was only to be used for weather and natural disasters.  In its nearly 3,000-page report, named Turning the Tides Together, the commission found the attack caused a  rupture of immeasurable magnitude and proportion  in the region and profoundly damaged the collective identity of those affected by the killings. Many residents said they no longer feel safe in their rural homes and others don't trust police to help in an emergency.  The report also provided the most detailed and harrowing accounting of what happened on 18 and 19 April 2020, capturing what one resident described as  trauma, disbelief, shock [and] sadness .  The evening of 18 April, the 51-year-old denturist Wortman assaulted his partner Lisa Banfield as they celebrated their 19th anniversary and then, armed with illegal firearms, left his home in a replica RCMP vehicle, driving around a beachside community. In less than an hour, he killed 13 neighbours and set fire to five homes and structures.  The shooter escaped and the next morning, killed nine more people. A police officer was among the dead.  Nearly 13 hours after the attack began, two RCMP officers shot and killed the gunman at a gas station.  The commission's hearings began in early 2021 and ran for nearly a year. The inquiry initially stemmed from the frustration and grief of families who demanded answers for how a gunman could spend hours driving around the Nova Scotia countryside, killing residents with seemingly little resistance from police.  Investigators conducted nearly 250 interviews, including with 79 members of the RCMP. But much to the frustration of victims' families, officers deployed as first responders were not cross examined by lawyers representing the victims in order to avoid amplifying the trauma they experienced. In response, some families boycotted the inquiry.  The commission was tasked with finding facts and making recommendations, but cannot assign blame or criminal and civil liability.  An impromptu memorial in front of the RCMP detachment Enfield, Nova Scotia Photograph: Tim Krochak/Getty Images  The commission found that, early on, officers mistakenly pursued Clinton Ellison, who had just discovered the body of his brother, Corrie Ellison, lying dead on the road.  We were getting ready to shoot him,  Constable Stuart Beselt told the commission.  If he would've ran, we would've shot him ... I'm very thankful I didn't shoot.   It also found the initial tactical response was marred by confusion: there was no clear chain of command and because they didn't know the area well, police didn't realise there was a gap in their containment efforts and that the shooter had escaped.  For most of the night, they operated under the assumption he was still near Portapique, or that he was dead. It wasn't until the next morning the RCMP  fully grasped  that he had escaped.  On the morning of the 19th, two Mounties accidentally fired five rounds at another officer they thought was the suspect, hitting a community hall where firefighters and an evacuee were sheltering.  Outdated technology, insufficient training and confusion over orders also hampered their response. Early in the response, an off-duty RCMP sergeant, driven to the detachment by his wife, was issuing orders to officers even though he'd told colleagues at the time he had consumed at least four alcoholic drinks earlier in the evening.  In addition to questions over police equipment and training, the commission also drew attention to domestic abuse as a root cause of mass violence. The shooter had a long history of violence against women and police were previously warned of his assaults and that he had a cache of illegal weapons.  The report found that  mass casualties occur infrequently, but women, children, and other marginalized people and communities experience violence every day . It said that society has long viewed mass violence as the greatest threat  without considering its relationship to other more pervasive forms  of violence.   We often fail to recognize the more insidious private violence that happens in our homes throughout this country, day in day out, and how that gets escalated,  the commission's chair, Michael MacDonald, told the Guardian.  Although mass casualties are rare, when they do occur, they often are the result of escalation of ongoing years of violence.   Lawyers for the victims previously said the RCMP must commit to changing the national police force, including new training and rethinking the command structure of the force.  In its section on policing, the commission uses the word  failure  91 times, including the lack of progress on an overhaul, an inability to convey accurate information to the public, chronically understaffed contract policing, and an inability to listen to the public.  One resident told the commission:  I fear the police. I will not call them in an emergency.   Another said the attack had  shaken my foundation of belief that law enforcement is there to protect you .  The commission concluded that statutory changes were needed to amend the governing RCMP Act and a significant overhaul required to how it operates its contract policing system. The commission warned a  lack of political will  and the  paramilitary  culture within policing stood as barriers to change.   More than two years after the event, RCMP leadership had done very little to systematically evaluate its critical incident response to the deadliest mass shooting in Canada's history,  the said the report.  Despite little progress from the national police force, MacDonald is optimistic there is sufficient momentum, and pressure, to make the changes that are necessary.   There are all kinds of reports with thousands of recommendations, sitting on shelves and unimplemented. This is not the first of these types of reports,  he said.  But it could be the last.

The Catholic Church therefore repudiates those concepts that fail to recognize the inherent human rights of Indigenous peoples, including what has become known as the legal and political 'doctrine of discovery'.   For decades, Indigenous leaders and community advocates had urged the Catholic Church to rescind the Doctrine of Discovery, which stated that European colonialists could claim any territory not yet  discovered  by Christians.  The papal bulls played a key role in the European conquest of Africa and the Americas, and their effects are still felt by Indigenous people.  Calls to rescind the Doctrine of Discovery grew louder last year when Pope Francis made a trip to Canada during which he apologised for the Catholic Church's role in widespread abuses that took place at so-called residential schools.  Between the late 1800s and 1990s, more than 150,000 Inuit, First Nation and Metis children across Canada were taken from their families and communities and obligated to attend the forced-assimilation institutions, which were rife with physical, psychological and sexual violence.  The Haudenosaunee External Relations Committee said at the time of the pope's residential school apology that more action was needed from the church - notably, the revocation of the papal bulls.   An apology to Indigenous Peoples without action are just empty words. The Vatican must revoke these Papal Bulls and stand up for Indigenous Peoples' rights to their lands in courts, legislatures and elsewhere in the world,  the committee said in a July 2022 statement.  Indigenous leaders welcomed Thursday's Vatican statement, even though it continued to take some distance from acknowledging actual culpability.  Phil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations in Canada who was part of the delegation that met with Pope Francis at the Vatican before last year's trip and then accompanied him throughout, said the statement was  wonderful .  He said it resolved an outstanding issue and now put the matter to civil authorities to revise property laws that cite the doctrine.   The Holy Father promised that upon his return to Rome, they would begin work on a statement which was designed to allay the fears and concerns of many survivors and others concerned about the relationship between their Catholic Church and our people, and he did as he said he would do,  Fontaine told The Associated Press news agency.   Now the ball is in the court of governments, the United States and in Canada, but particularly in the United States where the doctrine is embedded in the law,  he said.   Today's news on the Vatican's formal repudiation of the Doctrine of Discovery is the result of hard work and advocacy on the part of Indigenous leadership and communities,  Canadian Justice Minister David Lametti wrote on Twitter.  A doctrine that should have never existed. This is another step forward.   The Doctrine of Discovery was cited as recently as a 2005 US Supreme Court decision involving the Oneida Indian Nation and written by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  On Thursday, the Vatican offered no evidence that the three papal bulls (Dum Diversas in 1452, Romanus Pontifex in 1455 and Inter Caetera in 1493) had themselves been formally abrogated, rescinded or rejected, as Vatican officials have often said.  But it cited a subsequent papal bull, Sublimis Deus in 1537, that reaffirmed that Indigenous peoples should not be deprived of their liberty or the possession of their property, and were not to be enslaved.  Cardinal Michael Czerny, the Canadian Jesuit whose office co-authored the statement, stressed that the original papal bulls had long ago been abrogated and that the use of the term  doctrine  -- which in this case is a legal term, not a religious one -- had led to centuries of confusion about the church's role.  The original papal bulls, he said,  are being treated as if they were teaching, magisterial or doctrinal documents, and they are an ad hoc political move. And I think to solemnly repudiate an ad hoc political move is to generate more confusion than clarity .  He stressed that the statement was not just about setting the historical record straight, but  to discover, identify, analyse and try to overcome what we can only call the enduring effects of colonialism today .  Michele Audette, an Innu senator who was one of the five commissioners responsible for conducting the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls in Canada, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that the announcement left her in disbelief.   It's big,  she said in an interview on CBC Daybreak.  That doctrine made sure we did not exist or were even recognised ... It's one of the root causes of why the relationship is so broken.

In an interview Wednesday, the Liberal MPP for Scarborough-Guildwood became the latest high-profile candidate to confirm she will contest the June 26 byelection to replace John Tory.   I am running for mayor to make certain that Toronto is a city that works for everyone,  Hunter said, citing housing affordability and public safety on transit and elsewhere among the most pressing issues of the campaign.  The former chief administrative officer of Toronto Community Housing Corporation plans to sign up for the mayor's race when nominations open on Monday. But as a sitting MPP, provincial legislation dictates that in order to stay in the campaign until voting day, she will have to resign her seat in the legislature before nominations close on May 12.  Hunter, who was first elected to Queen's Park in 2013 and served as education minister in Kathleen Wynne's government, gave no date for when she plans to relinquish her seat. But she said she has no intention of dropping out of the mayor's race and staying on at Queen's Park if the early stages of what's expected to be a hotly contested campaign don't go her way.   Mitzie's in it to win it,  she said.  If she's successful, Hunter pledged to never employ the powers Premier Doug Ford's government bestowed on Toronto's mayor last year. The enhanced authorities include the ability to veto council decisions and pass measures with the support of just one-third of members, and have been called anti-democratic by critics.  Hunter said the strong-mayor powers shut councillors out of decision making.   It's important, in fact, that the mayor builds consensus amongst colleagues on council. Those locally elected councillors are representing the voice of Etobicoke, the voice of North York, the voice of East York, Scarborough, and the core of our city,  she said.  Hunter also vowed push the province to allow Toronto to use ranked ballots in municipal elections. The system allows voters to list multiple candidates in order of preference on their ballots, which supporters say results in more democratic results than the current  first-past-the-post  method. Hunter is a longtime advocate of the idea, which would require provincial approval.  RELATED STORIES City Hall Stay up to date with the Star's candidate tracker  To address the series of violent attacks on the TTC, Hunter said she would introduce a multi-pronged plan to improve safety that would include increasing police patrols and deploying social workers on the network, performing safety audits of stations, and eventually installing subway platform doors.   We need to make sure we address all forms of violence, particularly on our transit system. That has to remain safe,  she said.  Other candidates who have declared they will run for mayor include sitting councillors Josh Matlow and Brad Bradford, who won't have to resign their seats to contest the election. Former councillor Ana Bailao, former police chief Mark Saunders, urbanist Gil Penalosa, and policy analyst Chloe Brown have all also said they're running, while Etobicoke councillor Stephen Holyday and former NDP MP Olivia Chow have said they're considering it.

La excusa que utilizo el sector de la UCR-PRO y peronistas disidentes que responden al macrismo fue que el oficialismo  altero  el temario de la sesion, pactado ayer en Labor Parlamentaria.  No obstante, los acuerdos y negociaciones de esa reunion ya habian quedado estancadas, y anoche el interbloque de Juntos por el Cambio anticipo que podria impedir el inicio del debate sobre tablas.  La discusion en el recinto  En la apertura de la sesion, el jefe de la bancada de Juntos por el Cambio, Alfredo Cornejo, pidio que se postergara para abril el debate de la Ley de Alcohol Cero y de otros proyectos incluidos en el temario por la presidencia de la Camara.  Cornejo pretendia que se traten los pliegos de jueces de Rosario y de Cordoba y la Ley Lucio. Ante esta solicitud, el Frente de Todos inisistio con que se trataran los proyectos agendados y rechazo su mocion de orden.  El debate fue subiendo de tono hasta que la presidenta provisional del Senado, Claudia Ledesma, tercio para someter a votacion un pedido de alteracion de reglamento frente a la solicitud de la oposicion de cambiar el orden de temas, para lo cual se requieren dos tercios de los votos.  Luis Naidenoff, jefe de los senadores radicales, volvio a insistir con tratar la mocion de orden y afirmo que no correspondia votar una alteracion de reglamento.  Ante la insistencia de las autoridades de la Camara para votar primero ese punto, la totalidad de los bloques de Juntos por el Cambio y del flamante Unidad Federal, que lidera el peronista disidente Guillermo Snopek, decidieron abandonar el recinto, por lo que se frustro la primera sesion del ano parlamentario en el Senado.

Sin embargo, los miembros del bloque opositor de Juntos por el Cambio manifestaron su desacuerdo con el hecho de que se haya puesto en el temario temas no pedidos por ninguna de las bancadas, como el proyecto que prohibe el consumo de alcohol al conducir en todo el pais, que cuenta con media sancion de la Camara de Diputados."}, {"source": "google-news-au", "title": "Aston byelection seen as Dutton's make-or-break moment - Sydney Morning Herald", "text": "Liberal leader Peter Dutton faces a critical test of his leadership in the Aston byelection, say some federal party MPs who argue that a defeat could be fatal to his leadership.

Dice que no envian a sus hijos a la escuela.  El anuncio de la medida que afecta a los sectores mas pobres de la ciudad de Buenos Aires fue anunciada con bombos, platillos y un lema que suena a amenaza:  Sin educacion no hay plan .  La lupa sobre las familias que reciben los planes sociales que otorga el gobierno porteno fue puesta desde agosto del ano pasado, cuando el propio Larreta advirtio que los padres y madres de hijos que no cumplian con el 85% del presentismo escolar se quedarian sin el adicional por hijo del programa Ciudadania Portena.  Es decir que, a partir de ahora, los que no enviaron a sus ninos a la escuela dejaron de recibir el dinero para comer lo poco que podian comprar con ese plan social.  Larreta, en campana  Esta manana, el castigo fue concretado y anunciado en modo campana.

Ese 8 por ciento puesto en penitencia son 1.445 familias que dejan de percibir el adicional. Son todas de bajos recursos que viven en los barrios mas pobres de la ciudad.

I cannot fathom why we do not have cell service on the subway system,  Toronto Councillor Chris Moise, who sits on the TTC Board of Commissioners, said Wednesday.  Why is hard to answer, depending on who you ask.  BAI Communications Inc. was awarded the contract in 2012, paying the TTC $25 million for the exclusive rights to build cellular signal and WIFI infrastructure along subway tunnels and inside stations for 20 years.  A consortium of Canadian carriers including Bell, Rogers and Telus submitted a bid for $5.4 million. In a 2012 report to the TTC board, the commission recommended the BAI bid  to further enhance the transit experience of TTC's customers and to receive much needed revenue.   By 2018, over 75 km of fiber-optic cables were installed along subway tunnels, which now potentially allows users to make calls or answer text messages on the network at any subway station, in the tunnels for the downtown U--stations between Spadina and Bloor-Yonge--as well as between Sheppard West and Vaughan Metropolitan Centre Stations. However, only Freedom Mobile has signed on, while Canada's three largest carriers have refused to pay BAI to offer their customers the ability to use its subway cellular network.  City Councillor Paul Ainslie has been looking for answers since being appointed to the board. He sent a memo last December to TTC CEO Rick Leary, as well as former Toronto Mayor John Tory, and says he has also been speaking to the so-called  Big Three  telecom companies.   Their big hang-up is not so much that they don't want to sign on, is that the technology is so antiquated they wouldn't be able to give the service to their customers that the customers would expect,  he said in an interview with CTV News Toronto.  Bell said similarly when asked for comment.   BAI's 20-year, exclusive arrangement with the TTC prevents Bell and others from installing their own network infrastructure anywhere on the TTC subway system. The BAI infrastructure is outdated, and only installed in a small fraction of the TTC tunnels,  company spokesperson Ellen Murphy said in an email.  We would like the opportunity to provide TTC riders with the connectivity experience that they're envisioning when they call for cell service on the TTC.   Bell is the parent company of CTV News and CP24.  CTV News first sought comment in February. Rogers declined to comment, and Telus did not return any requests.   BAI Communications has forged strong partnerships with some of the largest telecommunications companies around the globe,  Vivan Kobeh with BAI Communications, told CTV News Toronto.  We are eager to work with all carriers to provide cellular access to all TTC riders.   TTC spokesperson Stuart Green says 911 service is available to all on the downtown U and western edge of Line 1, regardless of their cell carrier.   The yellow [emergency] strip on every vehicle is the best thing to do in an emergency,  he added.  Otherwise, it is not uncommon for subway riders to see others making frantic calls and text messages during the precious moments when the train emerges above-ground.  Ainslie says the contract with BAI may warrant being evaluated.   Eleven years to do WiFI in a subway system, compared to New York or Montreal, in particular, I think is reprehensible,  he said.  New York's subway has cell service for major carriers, managed and operated by a subsidiary of BAI. It also built the infrastructure for Hong Kong's transit system.  In Montreal, a consortium of Canadian carriers began outfitting the metro tunnels in 2013. The entire network of 71 kilometers and 68 stations has had 4G-LTE cellular service since 2020.  Calls to get cellular service on the entirety of Toronto's subway have been renewed after 16-year-old Gabriel Magalhaes was fatally stabbed last weekend while sitting on a bench at Keele Station.  Police say he was attacked unprovoked. On Wednesday, Toronto police said another incident on March 12, inside an eastbound Subway near Islington Station, was a hate-provoked attack.  In 2012, the original request for proposal gave the winner bidder twelve months to establish contracts with  sufficient  wireless carriers, and a grace period of another year.  In an email, Kobeh with BAI said  we adhere to TTC's operational schedule for our expansion plans.   But Moise says Toronto can't wait for BAI and Canadian carriers to play nice.   [Whether] my phone is from Bell, Rogers or Telus, when I get into the subway I should be able to use it,  said Moise,  and we as a city need to push them, or perhaps embarrass them to do the right thing.   Blaize Rafferty is one of the few who still has service on her way to work: she is with Freedom Mobile.   It's a really important safety feature that I think everyone should have access to,  she said outside Islington Station on Wednesday.   And I don't think having a contract with Freedom Mobile is a reason I should have access to it and others do not.

El plan del Palacio de Hacienda tiene tres pilares: un nuevo programa para alentar las exportaciones agroindustriales y de las economias regionales -un dolar agro, heredero del dolar soja-, una simplificacion del regimen impositivo que toca las importaciones y el turismo para unificar los llamados dolar  Coldplay ,  Qatar  o  Tecno  y mas fondos frescos de organismos multilaterales.  El nuevo regimen para alentar exportaciones, que se anunciaria el lunes, sera temporal: durara 90 dias para productos de las economias regionales como mani, arroz o el vino, y 30 dias para la soja. Para evitar un impacto en la inflacion, los productos incluidos dentro del nuevo esquema que se consuman en el pais irian acompanados de un acuerdo con las camaras empresariales que participan de la negociacion.  Con este nuevo programa, el Ministerio de Economia espera que se liquiden alrededor de US$15.000 millones en exportaciones hasta octubre.   El desafio es impulsar esta medida para fortalecer en el segundo trimestre las reservas y continuar el camino de estabilizacion que tiene que recorrer la Argentina , dijo Massa a corresponsales argentinos en Washington.  La sequia nos golpeo muy fuerte. Lo asume el Fondo, lo asumen todos aquellos que entienden el peso que tiene el sector agroexportador en la economia argentina, y creemos que asi como tomamos medidas para proteger y ayudar con beneficios impositivos a los productores que fueron victimas de la sequia, tambien tomamos medidas para promover las exportaciones y consolidar al agro en la posibilidad de cumplir sus contratos y al Banco Central en la posibilidad de fortalecer las reservas , indico.  Sergio Massa se reunio con Gita Gopinath, Subdirectora Gerente del FMI MECON  El nuevo dolar  agro  se discutio con el staff del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), donde nunca termino de digerir el dolar  soja  -el organismo rechaza la implementacion de tipos de cambio multiples-, que de todos modos se termino avalando ante las enormes dificultades del pais para sumar reservas a las arcas del Banco Central, ahora agravadas por la sequia.  Para el Fondo, la acumulacion de reservas es de vital importancia porque con esos recursos el Gobierno luego paga la deuda vigente con el organismo.  Ademas del nuevo dolar  agro , el Ministerio de Economia comenzara a trabajar en una simplificacion del regimen vigente para las importaciones y el turismo.  Aunque existe un solo tipo de cambio para importar, el dolar oficial, la multiplicidad de impuestos ha llevado a que, en la practica, se hable de un dolar  Qatar ,  Coldplay ,  Tarjeta  o  Tecno . Ese tambien ha sido un tema rispido en las discusiones con el Fondo, que, con todo, ha mostrado una notable flexibilidad para acomodar sus exigencias a las dificultades de la economia argentina y las limitaciones para implementar un programa de estabilizacion mas amplio y profundo.   El segundo gran desafio tiene que ver con empezar a recorrer un camino de simplificacion cambiaria a los efectos de que todo eso que aparece como dolar 'Coldplay', 'Tecno', empiece a trabajar y a operar en un esquema mas unificado , dijo Massa.  Massa y su equipo comenzaran a darle forma a ese nuevo esquema -sobre el que todavia no hay ningun detalle definido- para presentarselo al Fondo antes de la proxima auditoria, en la cual se revisaran las metas del primer trimestre y debe estar terminada en junio. En el Gobierno esperan que el board del Fondo apruebe la flexibilizacion del programa argentino. La reunion del board, aun sin confirmar por el organismo multilateral, podria ocurrir este viernes. El unico tema previsto en la agenda publica del Directorio es el prestamo para Ucrania.  archivo - Shutterstock  En el Ministerio de Economia aclararon que la idea es comenzar a simplificar los impuestos que afectan al turismo, los conciertos y algunas importaciones para avanzar a un sistema mas simple, unificado.  El ultimo componente de la ofensiva para sumar reservas y evitar un desmadre mayor de la economia es ampliar el respaldo de los organismos internacionales. Massa tiene casi cerrados nuevos programas con el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), la Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) y el Banco Mundial por alrededor de US$3000 millones, indicaron fuentes oficiales.  Se trata de fondos frescos, nuevos, y el ultimo eslabon de lo que el presidente Alberto Fernandez llamo  un puente que nos permita llegar al ano entrante  y transcurrir los proximos meses con  mas tranquilidad  luego de su reunion con el mandatario norteamericano, Joe Biden, en la Casa Blanca.  Asi y todo, con las tres patas de esa ofensiva, en el Ministerio de Economia calculan que aun faltaran otros US$3000 millones para terminar de transitar el ano sin sobresaltos, mas aun teniendo en cuenta que el calendario electoral alentara el acopio de dolares por la incertidumbre politica. Economia confia que podra allanar el camino de aqui hasta fin de ano para conseguir esos fondos.

La conduccion de la Asociacion Gremial de Trabajadores del Subte y Premetro (Agtsyp) anuncio para el viernes un nuevo paro de actividades, esta vez en las lineas D, E y Premetro, entre las 5.30 y las 7.30, como la continuidad de un  plan de lucha en demanda de la inmediata reduccion de la jornada laboral para gozar de dos francos , entre otros reclamos.   Manana entre las 5.30 y las 7.30 continuaremos nuestro plan de lucha reclamando reduccion de la jornada con 2 francos, para reducir la exposicion al asbesto, cambio de flotas contaminadas y reposicion de personal faltante , anuncio el gremio en un comunicado.  En ese marco, Claudio Dellecarbonara, secretariado ejecutivo de la Agtsyp, advirtio:  El plan de lucha y las medidas de fuerza continuaran en los proximos dias hasta obtener una respuesta satisfactoria a nuestros reclamos .  El comunicado de los trabajadores del subte.  En el texto, el gremio defiende la medida al senalar que  en los ultimos meses  mantuvieron audiencias y reuniones privadas en las que reclamaron la  reduccion de la jornada laboral para tener dos francos  pero no tuvieron una respuesta positiva de la empresa.   Recordamos que la necesidad de reducir la jornada semanal esta planteada por cuestiones de salud, para reducir la exposicion al asbesto, mineral cancerigeno cuya presencia en la red subterranea salo a la luz en el ano 2018 .  Las consignas planteadas en el comunicado publicado este jueves son las mismas por las que los trabajadores realizaron una medida de fuerza el miercoles, tambien entre las 5.30 y las 7.30, pero en ese caso en las lineas B y C.  El conflicto no es nuevo. Los metrodelegados tambien tomaron medidas de fuerza tiempo atras en reclamo de mayor medidas de seguridad, debido a reiterados episodios de violencia, puntualmente en la Linea C que une Constitucion con Retiro.

La medida en reclamo por las repetidas  situaciones de inseguridad  en la linea, se llevo adelante luego del asesinato de la oficial de la Policia Ciudad Maribel Zalazar (35), quien se acerco junto a un empleado de la empresa Emova, concesionaria del subte, para asistir a un pasajero que decia que se sentia mal y que termino matandola.   Exigimos que aumenten las medidas de seguridad para que podamos trabajar en mejores condiciones. Pedimos disculpas por las molestias que esto pueda ocasionar al publico , expresaron en ese momento los dirigentes gremiales.  El comunicado de la empresa      Emova, concesionaria de la red de Subtes de Buenos Aires, lamento en un comunicado la medida de fuerza gremial que por segunda vez en la semana perjudica  directamente a los usuarios , en una franja horaria  muy sensible .   Emova ha asistido a todas las audiencias desarrolladas por las autoridades laborales de la Ciudad, manifestando en reiteradas oportunidades su disposicion a analizar cambios en sus esquemas de trabajo, advirtiendo que resulta inviable reducir una jornada de 36 horas sin afectar las actividades de operacion y mantenimiento de la red de Subte , expresaron en el escrito.  Ademas, se refirieron al  plan desabestizacion en el Subte  y aclararon que desde la empresa dieron  continuidad al proceso iniciado por Metrovias, trabajando en una mesa interdisciplinaria creada para tal fin en la que participan tambien las entidades gremiales y que funciona en la Direccion de Proteccion del Trabajo del GCBA ."}, {"source": "google-news-au", "title": "'This is not over': Vaccine campaign, expanded eligibility for COVID antivirals as cases rise - Sydney Morning Herald", "text": "Around 160,000 extra Australians will be able to access subsidised COVID antiviral treatments from Saturday as virus cases rise and the federal government launches a new ad campaign encouraging booster doses.

La propuesta, promovida por diferentes sectores de la sociedad y de la oposicion, tuvo la adhesion de unos 54.000 vecinos que firmaron mas de 3000 planillas homologadas por la Justicia, un tramite clave para acceder al recinto.  Las tierras de Costa Salguero y Punta Carrasco son las protagonistas de esta trama que tiene intereses enfrentados entre la idea del gobierno de la ciudad de generar un espacio publico con una mixtura de usos que incluye parque, comercios y desarrollo inmobiliario, y la iniciativa popular que propone instalar en toda la superficie un parque publico de acceso libre, gratuito e irrestricto.  Son casi 30 hectareas las que estan en juego, 18 de Costa Salguero y 11 de Punta Carrasco, donde avanza un plan de transformacion del frente costero a medida que se van venciendo las concesiones de comercios, canchas de futbol de alquiler, club de golf y el centro de convenciones. La mayor parte de la superficie, segun el plan oficial, estara destinada a parque publico y el resto a viviendas, oficinas, espacios culturales, deportivos y de recreacion, con una altura maxima de 24 metros.  Al fallo judicial que prohibio la comercializacion de las tierras se le sumo el rechazo de un colectivo que se organizo y reunio 53.709 firmas para pedir por la derogacion de la ley Ndeg6289 que habilito la venta de Costa Salguero, adhesiones avaladas por el Tribunal Superior de Justicia (TSJ) de la ciudad al considerar que se cumplio el requisito de reunir el 1,5% del padron electoral porteno para que el expediente ingrese en la Legislatura.  Los trabajos avanzan en el Parque del Golf, el predio que fue ocupado durante 30 anos por un club de golf Santiago Filipuzzi - LA NACION   Se prohibe la subdivision parcelaria de las manzanas que lo componen, como asi tambien cualquier tipo de acto o disposicion que altere su caracter de espacio verde publico o limite el acceso publico y gratuito al parque , detalla uno de los articulos que fueron incorporados al proyecto.  Para que se convierta en ley hubiera necesitado una mayoria absoluta, es decir, 31 votos de los 60 legisladores que componen el cuerpo. Como el oficialismo aglutina a la mayor parte de los diputados, el proyecto no prospero: la votacion resulto con 21 positivos, 35 negativos y una abstencion. Pero se trato de un hecho historico, como lo expresaron ayer en la sesion de labor parlamentaria, ya que por primera vez el Poder Legislativo tomo una iniciativa popular y la debatio en el recinto.  Vecinos de la ciudad, arquitectos, ONG, organizaciones ambientales, sociales y politicas le fueron dando forma al reclamo hasta alcanzar una magnitud que no solo se refleja en las casi 54.000 firmas, sino que tambien se expreso en la audiencia publica celebrada en enero de 2021, con 29 jornadas de exposiciones y un record de 7049 inscriptos. De los 2060 que participaron finalmente, 2003 se manifestaron en contra del proyecto oficial, 55 lo hicieron a favor y hubo dos abstenciones. Es decir, hubo un 97% de participantes en contra del cambio normativo impulsado por el Ejecutivo en Costa Salguero y Punta Carrasco.  La iniciativa popular ingreso a la Legislatura a traves del senador nacional Mariano Recalde en su calidad de ciudadano y uno de los 14 promotores designadosm entre los que tambien estan la portavoz presidencial, Gabriela Cerruti, y la exdiputada Maria Jose Lubertino. Luego, fue el Frente de Todos quien movilizo la discusion.  El proyecto oficial de recuperacion de la costa rioplatense contempla varios proyectos con una mixtura de usos entre el parque verde y publico y el desarrollo de comercios y viviendas   La preocupacion y el profundo rechazo demostrado por la ciudadania frente al avance del proyecto inmobiliario sobre Costa Salguero y Punta Carrasco, deslindado ya del proyecto madre Distrito Joven, nos ubica en la necesidad de pedir por este medio la derogacion de la ley Ndeg6289 que autoriza la disposicion de la parcela de Costa Salguero, la desafectacion de dichas parcelas de la U14 Distrito Joven y el emplazamiento de un gran parque publico de acceso libre e irrestricto , reza el documento entre sus fundamentos.  El plan de recuperacion costera  Mas alla de esta discusion parlamentaria, el plan oficial de recuperacion costera no se detiene y ya avanza con acciones concretas, por ejemplo, con el Parque del Golf en el predio que fue ocupado por el Golf Club Costa Salguero que funciono durante mas de 30 anos. Esta obra plantea la consolidacion de un paseo al borde del rio y un parque de casi nueve hectareas entre el exdriving Golf, y el espacio que fue ocupado por concesionarias y otros sectores de uso privado.  El proyecto integral fue bautizado como BA Costa y contempla otras intervenciones sobre la sirga del Rio de la Plata para generar, por ejemplo, la Plaza Memorial AMIA sobre los escombros del edificio donde se produjo el atentado; los parques Costero, Del Vega y Carrasco (17 hectareas de espacio verde); la integracion de la Reserva Ecologica y Costa Urbana, sobre las 51 hectareas de la ex Ciudad Deportiva de Boca.  Sobre Costa Salguero, la normativa que modifico la zonificacion fue tratada en la Legislatura en octubre de 2020 cuando se aprobo que el 77,5% del predio sea un parque publico. La audiencia publica se inicio el 27 de noviembre de 2020 y finalizo el 28 de enero de 2021 para llegar, meses despues, a la aprobacion en segunda lectura.  En simultaneo avanzaba un recurso de amparo presentado por Cerruti y el Observatorio del Derecho a la Ciudad ante los tribunales locales para impugnar el procedimiento de sancion de la ley 6289.  Ante la apelacion del gobierno porteno, la Camara de Apelaciones en lo Contencioso Administrativo y Tributario de la Ciudad confirmo el fallo con el que se declaro la inconstitucionalidad de la ley que autorizaba la venta del predio de Costa Salguero. El Ejecutivo recurrio entonces al TSJ, al considerar que el amparo presentado no tiene sustento legal. Esta accion continua aun sin definirse, mientras la iniciativa popular naufrago y continua el proyecto oficial."}, {"source": "google-news-au", "title": "Andrew Bolt unleashes on Mark Latham for 'disgusting' homophobic tweet - Sky News Australia", "text": "Mark Latham is under fire for a  depraved  homophobic tweet targeting NSW independent MP Alex Greenwich, with both Andrew Bolt and Pauline Hanson branding it  disgusting .  Mr Latham was set to appear on Sky News Australia's The Bolt Report to discuss One Nation's lacklustre performance at the NSW state election.  Instead, host Andrew Bolt spoke to viewers about what he described as a tweet  so disgusting, so homophobic and so vile in a pornographic way that I can't even hint at what he said.   Mark Latham posted and then deleted a  disgusting  tweet targeting NSW independent MP Alex Greenwich. Picture: Gaye Gerard / NCA Newswire   I'd asked Mark Latham to come on tonight to explain what went wrong for him in the NSW election. But as you can see, no Mark. Nor will there ever be,  Bolt said.   Latham this morning put out a tweet so disgusting that even he felt ashamed and eventually deleted it, but much too late.   It was what a scumbag would write. A drunk one. Except he wrote it not at night - but at 10:30 AM this morning!   Mark Latham's tweet was targetted at Alex Greenwich, an openly gay independent MP in the NSW parliament. Picture: Jane Dempster/The Australian.  Bolt pointed out that this was not the first time Latham had shown a tendency to self-destruct, but that he didn't think he'd come back from this one.   Many former colleagues in Labor refuse to speak to him after he betrayed them in a seeming rage. There was the (Sarah) Abo joke. There was the fight with a taxi driver whose arm was broken,  he said.   Now this tweet, I don't think he'll ever live it down. He will be a pariah, and not just here at Sky. I wonder how he will be able to function as a political leader when he's earned the contempt of so many for his abuse.   According to Bolt, this is a  real problem  for One Nation founder and federal leader Pauline Hanson.   Latham taints her. She has tried to reign him in, but now this,  he said.   Does Latham know that Hanson's closest advisor for years, a top bloke, is himself gay?   Bolt asked Ms Hanson to come on the program but that she was  furious  and didn't trust herself to come on in case she  really explodes .  However Hanson did send a video about Latham's actions - which she also posted on social media.   I want you to know that I don't condone them and neither do my members of parliament or party associates,   I think they are disgusting.  Ms Hanson said she had been unable to get through to Mr Latham since the incident but had sent him a text message telling him her views and asking him to apologise.   I will leave it that. It is now over to Mark to answer to the people,  she said.  Sky News Australia's Andrew Bolt was forthright in his condemnation of Mark Latham's behaviour, describing it as  disgusting and depraved.  Picture: Sky News Australia  Bolt ended the segment by addressing Mr Latham directly:   Mark, get treatment. You are such a clever man, with so much to offer, but you seem to have a death wish.    You crack and say things that are so cruel and vicious and now homophobic that the one who's hurt most is you.

Cuando fueron a ver, se toparon con una escena horrorosa: en el patio interno estaba el cuerpo totalmente desnudo de una mujer. Habia caido del sexto piso y murio en el acto.  Segun pudo corroborar Clarin, la victima -cuyos datos no se difundieron- habia estado en el departamento con un empresario de 52 anos, vinculado al mundo agropecuario, y al menos otra mujer. Se trata de Francisco Saenz Valiente, que ahora quedo detenido imputado por homicidio, segun dijeron fuentes policiales.   Yo sabia que ahi habia cosas raras, habia prostitutas , conto a este diario una vecina que vive en el lugar, quien pidio reserva de identidad.  El edificio, ubicado en la calle Libertad 1542, tiene siete pisos de altura. Testigos contaron que el portero escucho gritos que salian del departamento justo antes de que la mujer cayera al pulmon del inmueble.  El edificio de Libertad 1542 donde ocurrio el hecho. Foto Juano Tesone  La victima fallecio en el acto por las graves heridas que sufrio. En un desesperado intento para salvarla, fue asistida por bomberos y trasladada al Hospital Fernandez, donde constataron su muerte.    Fuentes policiales indicaron que personal de la Comisaria Vecinal 1 A de la Policia de la Ciudad acudio al edificio luego de un llamado al 911 en el que se denuncio que  habia una persona alterada  en el sexto piso.  Pero aclararon que inmediatamente adujeron que  se habia arrojado desde esa planta al vacio . Eso ocurrio alrededor de las 9.15.  Alberto Crescenti, titular del SAME, confirmo que al llegar la ambulancia, siete minutos despues del aviso desde la central,  la mujer ya estaba muerta . A su vez, explico que la persona fallecida estaba en un patio interno del edificio al que la medica del SAME tuvo que acceder atravesando una ventana.  Era una mujer de aproximadamente 28 anos , afirmo.    La mujer murio en el acto. Foto Juano Tesone  Por su parte, la Policia remarco que los agentes acompanaron al hombre que hizo la denuncia, que se encontraba tambien en el sexto piso, y a una mujer de nacionalidad brasilena que estaba en planta baja, Juliana Magalhaes Mourao. A la mujer le van a tomar declaracion como testigo.    Ademas, se investiga la version de que habia una tercera mujer en el departamento y que podria haberse ido antes de que llegara la Policia. Uno de los ultimos partes policiales afirma que, horas antes del fallecimiento de la mujer, Saenz Valiente se encontraba con ella y con otra mujer, consumiendo bebidas alcoholicas.    En el lugar trabajaron Bomberos y el SAME.  La Justicia intenta ahora averiguar la conexion entre todos ellos y como sucedieron los hechos. Se secuestraron las camaras de seguridad en la zona. La causa tramita en el juzgado nacional en lo criminal y correccional Ndeg 31 a cargo del juez Martin Carlos Del Viso.  Hermetismo en un barrio exclusivo  Pese a estar en el limite entre dos barrios como Retiro y Recoleta, y muy cerca de Avenida Alvear, Libertad al 1500 es una cuadra tranquila, callada, sin presencia de negocios o locales, mas que de uno solo: una tienda de venta de alimentos dieteticos ubicado justo a un edificio de distancia del lugar en el que ocurrio el hecho.  Alli, tambien hay silencio. La mayoria de la gente de los alrededores camina y mira hacia el edificio del que, horas antes, se llevaron a Saenz Valiente y a juliana Magalhaes Mourao, la mujer brasilena que lo acompanaba. Pero nadie dice nada.  La expectativa esta puesta en lo que pueda decir Raul, el encargado que fue testigo de lo que paso, y que hace mas de 6 horas esta declarando.  A veces, los vecinos mas curiosos preguntan. Vecinos con perros, con coches de bebes, se acercan de vez en cuando a la puerta de Libertad 1542 y consultan con la mujer policia que custodia la puerta de entrada:  Perdon, ?que paso aca? ,  ?Por que hay medios de television? , son algunos de los interrogantes que no reciben respuesta de la fuerza policial.  Es confidencial , les repiten. Asi, sin mas explicaciones y sin insistir, siguen de largo.   Yo estaba adentro en el garaje acomodando autos. Me di cuenta del lio cuando pasaron los bomberos. Pararon a mitad de cuadra. Ahi sali a ver y me entere de lo que pasaba , dijo a Clarin Walter, portero de un edificio de la cuadra.   Me dijeron algunos propietarios que habian escuchado gritos, despues preguntando me entere de lo ocurrido , agrego y, segun se dijo en el lugar, primero la mujer habria intentado tirarse por la ventana que da a la calle. Pero se lo habrian impedido y termino cayendo por la del pulmon.  Sobre el empresario, Walter dijo que no lo conocia pero comento que  se veia a veces parar autos y bajar chicas .  Unas personas cuchichean en una esquina de la cuadra. No quieren acercarse a la prensa, no quieren dar testimonio, pero entre ellas coinciden en algo:  Es que nadie quiere hablar, porque es un tipo de familia de plata, de mucha plata. Nadie se va a meter a opinar .  Muy pocos de ellos, contados con los dedos de las manos, parecen al tanto de lo sucedido. Sin embargo, la mayoria de los que acceden a declaracion prefieren resguardar su identidad.   El siempre trae mujeres. Siempre. A cualquier hora, de dia o de noche, no importa. No es la primera vez , comenta una mujer muy cerca del edificio de Saenz Valiente.  Otros, dan mas informacion, y exponen sus opiniones, pero tambien prefieren no dar a conocer sus nombres:  Hace cuatro anos que se vive esto, no es de ahora. Hace cuatro anos que todos los dias se ven estas cosas. Chicas que llegan en autos desde el conurbano bonaerense, que llegan por el. Hacen de todo, y despues se van .  Francisco Saenz Valiente, el empresario dueno del departamento de donde cayo y murio una mujer en Retiro.   Los propietarios han vivido varias situaciones, como que esas mujeres les vinieran a golpear la puerta a la madrugada, a gritarles el nombre de el. Completamente perdidas , agrega.   El siempre salia camuflado a la calle, con un gorrito negro, por eso muchos dicen que no lo conocen , enfatiza la fuente, que tambien senala que se han visto situaciones de mujeres semidesnudas salir del edificio en cuestion.   Yo solo escuche la sirena del patrullero bien temprano en la manana, pero nada mas. No oi gritos, aunque se que hubo vecinos que si. Yo no lo conozco a el, no tengo relacion con propietarios de otros edificios , contesta una vecina de la misma cuadra.  Entrada la noche, algunos resisten en la calle de enfrente al edificio de Saenz Valiente, pero el hermetismo continua. El hermetismo de Saenz Valiente y de Magalhaes Mourao, quienes no han dado informacion sobre la joven fallecida. El hermetismo de la causa, que presenta secreto de sumario. Y el hermetismo de los que se quedaron en Libertad 1542, quienes en casi todos los casos dicen no conocer o no saber nada de lo ocurrido horas antes, al lado o frente a sus casas.

Australia's parliament has passed breakthrough climate laws targeting the nation's worst polluters, forcing coal mines and oil refineries to curb emissions by about 5 percent each year.  The laws apply to 215 major industrial facilities - each producing more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year - and form the backbone of Australia's pledge to reach net zero emissions by 2050.  Experts on Thursday said the laws signalled the end of Australia's bitter  climate wars  - a decade of political brawling that has repeatedly derailed attempts to tackle the country's contribution to global warming.  With the new legislation, the country's centre-left Labor government has forecast it can stop 200 million tonnes of carbon from being pumped into the atmosphere over the next decade.   What the parliament has done today is safeguard our climate, safeguard our economy, and safeguard our future,  Australia's Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen told lawmakers.   What the parliament has done today is brought an end to 10 years of dysfunction and 10 years of delay.   'We have a climate policy now'  Aluminium smelters, coal mines, oil refineries and other large polluters will be forced to cut their emissions by 4.9 percent each year.   It's the first time greenhouse gas emissions reduction has been written into Australian law,  said University of New South Wales sustainability expert Tommy Wiedmann.  That's obviously a good thing. We have a climate policy now.   In the weeks ahead of the vote, the government struck a deal on the so-called Safeguard Mechanism after engaging in high-stakes bargaining with the left-wing Greens party.  The previously sceptical Greens, whose support was needed to pass the laws, agreed to back the carbon plan after persuading the government to put a hard cap on emissions.  Greens leader Adam Bandt said the move compelled oil and gas corporations to slash their emissions  for the first time ever in law .  Climate 'stalemate'  Australia's economy is fuelled by mining and coal exports, and it is among the biggest emitters of carbon dioxide per capita in the world.  For years, Australia had the reputation of being a laggard on global action to stop climate change. But a series of severe natural disasters helped convince the country's leaders to take the climate emergency seriously.  Heavy storms in 2022 caused catastrophic floods on Australia's east coast, in which more than 20 people died.  The  Black Summer  bushfires of 2019-2020 burned more than eight million hectares (19.7 million acres) of native vegetation, while marine heatwaves caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2017 and 2020.  Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government swept to power last year promising to change the pro-fossil fuel stance of the previous decade-old conservative government.  Although many praised the laws as a crucial first step, sustainability expert Wiedmann warned Australia could not rest on its laurels.   It's not enough on its own to reduce emissions and avoid dangerous climate change,  he said.  The hard decisions will come in the next few years.   Murdoch University sustainability expert Martin Brueckner said the plan ended Australia's climate  stalemate  and gave a strong signal to businesses.   It pretty much pushes climate denialists in a corner. We had a lot of market investment uncertainty over the last 10 years under the poorly defined climate policy,  he said.   Having made that first policy step - as small as it may be - I think it paves the way for more progressive policies to follow.   'Facilities will close'  Australia's mining industry has warned the financial burden of compliance could lead to massive job losses.   If we are not careful, some facilities in Australia will close,  the Minerals Council of Australia said before the laws passed.   Not only would that damage our economy and slash tens of thousands of regional jobs and billions in investment, it also would push the emissions reduction burden onto other nations that are less able or less willing to decarbonise.   Global mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP operate a number of mines and smelters that will be forced to make emissions cuts.  Australia's Climate Council has estimated the 215 facilities are responsible for almost 30 percent of the country's total emissions."}, {"source": "google-news-au", "title": "Former premier Dominic Perrottet's touching act to staff after election loss - Sky News Australia", "text": "Former New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet made a heartwarming gesture to his staff who lost their jobs when he suffered a defeat in the state election.

These changes are about creating the environment of knowledge information, and then supporting employers to not only know what they need to do, but then drive that to action.   Speaking in support of the bill, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the move would put a spotlight on the pay gap between men and women, and the gap between a company's words and its actions.   This bill will enable the Workplace Gender Equality Agency to report on the gender pay gap by employer, not just by industry, so from early next year rather than talking about an overall a national figure. Australians will be able to see how individual companies are progressing.    I want to see employers competing and innovating to be the best in the nation on gender equality,  Mr Albanese said.  Advertisement  Nationals MP and former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack also spoke in favour of the changes, which stemmed from a review ordered by the previous Coalition government.   We totally take ownership of these reforms,  Mr McCormack told parliament.  After a long list of speakers, the lower house passed the amendments on Thursday. The bill had already been passed by Senate, where the bill was introduced by the Minister for Women Katy Gallagher.  The changes will lead to the publication of gender pay gap reports for companies with more than 100 employees (about 40 per cent of the total workforce) and federal agencies. If state governments come on board, this would see around 60 per cent of all employees covered.  The published reports will be de-identified, so individual remuneration is not exposed.  Gender pay gaps are not a comparison of like roles, but rather show the difference between the average pay of women and men across organisations, industries and the workforce as a whole.  Advertisement  Employer gender pay gaps will be published by mean (average), median (middle point) and remuneration quartile to avoid unfair comparisons of firms with large numbers of entry-level female employees.  For the first time, chief executive remuneration must be included in pay data. Nearly 80 per cent of CEOs in Australia are men. Because CEOs are often the highest-paid employees at an organisation, this will affect the gap calculation. It will likely make the gaps look much larger.  Professional services outfits such as law and accounting firms are not yet required to provide pay data for partners.  The first gap reports will be published early next year. They will identify the median difference between male and female pay at each organisation and the pay gap at each remuneration quartile.  Employers will be able to provide a statement that gives context to their gender pay gap results or outlines their plans for action.  The publishing of employer level pay gaps follows similar moves in the UK, except that in Australia WGEA will publish the reports, rather than firms and agencies.  Advertisement   What we've seen in the UK is that companies that are taking action as a result of having the gender pay gap published is resulting in more women being promoted to senior levels, leading to a reduction in the gender pay gap,  Ms Woodridge said.  Ms Wooldridge pointed to 2020 Curtin University research using WGEA data that showed firms with greater gender diversity had superior business performance.  It showed an increase of 10 percentage points or more in female representation on boards leads to a 4.9 per cent increase in company market value, equal in Australia to about $78.5 million.   It's always surprised me that in the face of undeniable evidence that it's going to be good for business some CEOs and boards and executive teams have not acted.

Ce texte propose un nouveau cadre legislatif pour endiguer certaines pratiques qui ont fait polemique ces derniers mois. Le texte a ete adopte a 49 voix pour, et zero contre.  Parmi les principales dispositions figure une definition d'un influenceur, avec, en cas de manquements, un risque d'interdiction d'exercer et d'amendes importantes, souvent alignees sur le secteur de la publicite.  Medecine esthetique et vapotage interdits  Le texte contient certaines interdictions notables, comme l'interdiction de faire la promotion de chirurgie ou de medecine esthetique. Il encadre par ailleurs les publicites pour les jeux d'argent, les paris sportifs, et prohibe toute publication commerciale pour le vapotage, apres l'adoption d'un amendement porte par des deputes de la majorite.  Afin de proteger la sante mentale des plus jeunes face aux plateformes comme Instagram ou TikTok, l'Assemblee nationale a egalement vote l'obligation de mentionner l'existence de filtres visant a modifier la forme du corps ou du visage, pour toute publicite d'influenceur.  La loi s'attaque par ailleurs a la promotion de produits financiers - ou tout type de placement financier, au coeur de nombreuses accusations d'escroqueries liees a des promesses d'argent facile. Les cryptoactifs sont eux aussi concernes: en l'etat actuel du texte, et avant un passage au Senat, plus aucun influenceur ne pourrait faire la promotion de cryptomonnaies ou de NFT.  Le texte encadre par ailleurs la profession d'agent d'influenceur et impose desormais la redaction de contrats pour tout type d'operation d'influence.

Defendio el canje de bonos  Agustin Rossi conoce como pocos el territorio de la Camara de Diputados y para la presentacion de su primer informe de gestion de Gobierno apelo a un fuerte de discurso, casi de campana, que corono acusando a la dirigencia del campo de haber instalado la violencia politica en el pais a partir del conflicto de 2008. Todo eso luego de reprochar a la oposicion la falta de una condena  contundente  frente al intento de magnicidio contra Cristina Kirchner.  Tal como establece la Constitucion, el jefe de Gabinete se presento este miercoles en Diputados para rendir cuentas y dar detalles de la politica del Gobierno nacional. En ese escenario advirtio que la Argentina convive con cuatro crisis: la pandemia, la guerra por la invasion rusa a Ucrania, la sequia y el endeudamiento con el Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), pero intento sin exito esquivar el tema inflacion y canje de bonos.  Primero destaco la baja en la desocupacion, el crecimiento de las inversiones extranjeras y las 5 mil obras publicas del Gobierno. Hizo una defensa de la estatizacion de YPF como asi tambien del papel de Aerolineas Argentinas. Pero uno de los momentos de mayor tension se vivio cuando Rossi llevo al recinto el ataque que sufrio el ano pasado Cristina Kirchner.  Exposicion de Agustin Rossi en Diputados, este miercoles. Foto Lucia Merle.   Lamentablemente el ano pasado volvio la violencia politica a la Argentina , arranco el jefe de Gabinete en referencia al ataque que la vicepresidenta sufrio en septiembre de 2022, cuando un joven gatillo dos veces a la cabeza de la vicepresidenta.  Rossi, quien presidio el bloque oficialista en Diputados en distintas gestiones durante el kirchnerismo, no dejo que los representantes de la oposicion tomaran aire para reprocharles:  Hubiese merecido una respuesta mas contundente de la totalidad de la dirigencia politica .  Hernan Lombardi (PRO) salto de su banca y cuestiono al ministro coordinador, pero Rossi devolvio enseguida:  Todavia estamos esperando la condena de la presidenta de tu partido  en referencia al silencio de Patricia Bullrich, mientras el diputado opositor decia que estaba mintiendo.  No miento, digo la verdad , completo.  Pero lejos de cerrarse la discusion en aquel reclamo en defensa de la vicepresidenta, el jefe de Gabinete continuo con su ofensiva de tono proselitista y le apunto a los diputados que  la violencia politica en la Argentina comenzo mucho antes  al ataque a la vicepresidenta.   No quiero traer discusiones pasadas, pero en 2008 cuando fue el conflicto con el sector agropecuario empezo la violencia politica en al Argentina , sentencio el funcionario para agregar:  Esa fue la primera vez que vi un cartel que decia 'yegua' refiriendose a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner . La frase desato la bronca de la oposicion y Rossi se regodeo diciendo  como los puse .  Tambien le apunto a los libertarios cuando planteo que  el extremismo de derecha existe en la Argentina .  Lo que sucedio con Cristina Kirchner no es producto de la casualidad. Si uno se queda con eso, se equivoca. Para que haya existido, existio antes una campana de discursos del odio , fundamento.  A la hora de las preguntas, Jose Luis Espert fue quien le planteo a Rossi el tema de la inflacion cuando luego de calificarlo de  caradura  al funcionario le apunto que la suba de precios  se come el salario de los trabajadores, los jubilados se mueren de hambre, la pobreza explota . Nunca me insultaron tanto como usted, tiene un merito. Debe ser su forma fascistoide de expresarse , respondio el ministro coordinador.      Defensa cerrada de los DNU  Pero fue frente a los insistentes reclamos de la oposicion que el jefe de Gabinete defendio los DNU que impulsan el canje de bonos de la ANSeS y sobre este punto remarco que es  una herramienta mas para combatir la inflacion . Explico que la intencion del Gobierno es  operar  sobre el mercado del contado con liqui y el dolar blue para que  no se agrande mucho la brecha y no tener una intencion inflacionaria mayor . Y fue mas alla porque garantizo que la medida que lleva adelante el ministro Sergio Massa permitira que el Fondo de Garantia de Sustentabilidad obtenga  una mayor rentabilidad .  Sin embargo, Ricardo Lopez Murphy fue uno de los legisladores que cuestiono el plan de canje.  Durante varios anos dijeron que quieren pesificar la deuda y lo que estan haciendo es emitir deuda dolarizada a tasas extravagantes, disparatadas , le reprocho.  En una de sus ultimas intervenciones, Rossi tambien evito responder sobre la jubilacion de la vicepresidenta con el argumento de que esta vinculada con los sueldos de los jueces de la Corte Suprema.  No queremos develar ese monto, ?no pretendera que nos enemistemos con la Corte por una situacion de esas caracteristicas? , dijo con tono ironico, quien aclaro que Cristina Kirchner recibe una pension y una jubilacion.  En el cierre de la sesion informativa, Mario Negri apelo a una ironia para descalificar el discurso del jefe de Gabinete al apuntar que dio un  masterclass de posverdad .   Apelo a la emocionalidad para convencer a los propios, por eso lo aplaudieron. Pero la realidad es la que estamos describiendo nosotros , anadio.  Cristian Ritondo. jefe del bloque del PRO.

Abogada, Avila hizo su carrera politica en el gobierno de Catamarca, donde nacio, y llego a conducir el Ministerio de Mineria provincial, antes de ser designada a nivel nacional.  En una entrevista con LA NACION, la funcionaria destaco que, pese a las restricciones macroeconomicas, hay 19 proyectos mineros en operacion y otros seis en construccion. El ano pasado, las exportaciones del sector generaron ingresos por US$3857 millones. Se espera que este ano vuelvan a subir y superen los US$4300 millones.  De ese total, las exportaciones de litio fueron US$700 millones, con un crecimiento de 234% en 2022. Ademas, hay otros seis proyectos de litio en construccion, lo que explica el rol protagonico que podria ejercer la Argentina en la transicion energetica.  -?Cuantos proyectos mineros hay en operacion?  -La Argentina tiene 19 proyectos en produccion. Hay 12 proyectos de oro, cuatro de plata, dos de litio y uno de carbon. Las provincias donde mas se produce son Santa Cruz y San Juan. Las dos plantas de litio en funcionamiento estan ubicadas en el Salar de Olaroz, de la empresa Sales de Jujuy, en Jujuy, y en el Salar del Hombre Muerto, de la empresa Livent, en Catamarca. Uno esta operativo desde 2015 y el otro, desde la decada del 90. Ademas, tenemos seis proyectos en construccion, la mayoria son de litio, y estan distribuidos en las provincias de Salta, Catamarca y Jujuy. Este es el motivo por el cual todo el mundo esta hablando del litio en la Argentina, que es un elemento central para la transicion energetica, para la construccion de vehiculos electricos y para el desarrollo de las energias renovables. Todo el mundo esta en busqueda de este mineral, que es un elemento central para cumplir con las metas de descarbonizacion de los paises. Eso hace que la Argentina hoy este en el foco del interes.  La secretaria de Mineria, Fernanda Avila Secretaria de Mineria  -?En que estado estan los proyectos de litio que se estan construyendo? ?Cual es la produccion?  -Ademas de los dos proyectos en produccion y los seis en construccion, hay mas de 30 proyectos que estan distribuidos en todo el pais en etapas de exploracion, para luego pedir los permisos de construccion y produccion. La Argentina hoy ocupa un rol importante en la produccion mundial de litio; somos el cuarto productor, despues de Australia, Chile y China. Ademas, somos el segundo en materia de recursos de litio, despues de Bolivia, y el tercero en reservas (los recursos con viabilidad economica de explotacion), despues de Chile y Australia. Tenemos muchisimo potencial para seguir creciendo en la escala de produccion. La Argentina tiene una capacidad de produccion instalada de 37.500 toneladas de carbonato de litio equivalente y una produccion anual promedio de 33.000 toneladas. Con los proyectos que tenemos en construccion, en los proximos cinco anos vamos a producir 200.000 toneladas. Esto quiere decir que vamos a sextuplicar nuestra capacidad productiva.  -?Cuanto representan las exportaciones de litio? ?Y cuanto podrian representar en cinco anos?  -Con dos proyectos en etapa productiva, hoy el litio representa el 18% de las exportaciones totales. En 2022 fueron US$700 millones, del total de US$3857 millones, pero tuvieron un crecimiento de 234% interanual. El litio es un elemento muy importante para la transicion energetica, pero no es un mineral que tenga un precio tan alto o que genere tanta ganancia como el oro o el cobre. Los valores del litio tambien son muy volatiles, hoy estamos en precios muy altos, pero si seguimos las proyecciones internacionales, en 2025, si incorporamos los seis proyectos que estan en construccion, podemos estar exportando US$5000 millones.  -?A que precio seria eso?  -El precio del litio, al no ser una commodity, no tiene un valor establecido. El precio que figura de US$60.000 la tonelada es un valor spot, el precio de cuando te queda un remanente por fuera de los valores contractualizados. El precio promedio que tomamos para los US$5000 millones es de US$22.500 la tonelada.  Argentina Extrema Salinas grandes de Jujuy. Litio Ph: silvana colombo silvana colombo  -Los inversores mineros suelen tener dos preocupaciones en la Argentina: el no tener la seguridad de que se mantengan las mismas alicuotas de retenciones y el cepo cambiario. ?Que les responden cuando les plantean esas dudas?  -Es una conversacion que venimos manteniendo con todas las empresas mineras y la tenemos con los inversores cuando viajamos al exterior. La mineria tiene una particularidad. Es una inversion de mucho riesgo, no solo asociado a las condiciones economicas del pais, sino que solo uno de cada 100 proyectos llega a ser viable explotarlo economicamente. Ahi esta el riesgo asociado a invertir a largo plazo y se necesitan condiciones estables de la macro del pais para tomar la decision. Los proyectos duran entre 20 y 30 anos, se necesitan tener ciertas garantias. En el pais esta la ley de inversiones mineras, que genera un marco propicio para las inversiones, pero por supuesto esta atado al control de cambios. Son cuestiones que tratamos de remarcar que son coyunturales. A medida que actividades como la mineria y la energia comiencen a desarrollarse, van a empezar a levantarse las restricciones. Creemos que hay herramientas hoy en el pais para que se tomen decisiones de inversion y lo estamos viendo, por eso hay US$11.318 millones de anuncios de inversion. De este total, US$4853 millones corresponden a operaciones de cobre, US$5141 millones de litio, US$1293 millones de oro y US$30 millones de plata.  -De esos anuncios de inversion, ?cuantos se concretaron?  -Es un calculo muy dificil de hacer, pero hay seis proyectos en construccion y dos que se estan expandiendo. Las inversiones se estan realizando. En el corto plazo se espera que seis proyectos de litio, que a la fecha se encuentran en construccion, entren en produccion en las provincias de Jujuy, Salta y Catamarca. Se trata de Cauchari Olaroz y Mariana, ambos de la firma china, Ganfeng Lithium; Centenario-Ratones, de la empresa francesa Eramet; Sal de Oro, de la surcoreana Posco; Sal de Vida, de la australiana Allkem Lda, y Tres Quebradas, de la empresa china Zijin Mining Group.  -?Creen que los proyectos podrian avanzar mas rapido si no hubiese control de cambio o restricciones para importar insumos o maquinaria?  -Obviamente, somos conscientes que ciertas restricciones que existen hoy en el pais hacen que las inversiones puedan ir un poco mas lento. La buena noticia es que a pesar de todas las restricciones, el ano pasado aumentamos las exportaciones, no solo por mayores precios, sino tambien por cantidad. Y este ano proyectamos que sean mejores, en alrededor de US$4300 millones. Por supuesto que sabemos que las condiciones actuales de inversion no son los mejores, pero creemos que el dialogo que existe con las empresas ayuda a que puedan seguir adelante con su plan de inversion. Claro que lo ideal seria levantar ciertas restricciones, pero no es facil ahora con el impacto de la sequia. La sequia justamente marca la importancia que tiene para el pais diversificar su matriz economica y no ser dependiente de un solo sector.  La secretaria de Mineria, Fernanda Avila Secretaria de Mineria  -Tenemos muchas reservas de litio. ?Es posible generar tambien valor agregado y que se construyan en la Argentina baterias de litio?  -Es una discusion que hay que dar. Es muy buena la mesa de litio, que conforman los gobernadores de Salta, Catamarca y Jujuy, con participacion del Estado nacional. Ahi se esta discutiendo como seguimos agregando valor en territorio al litio. La Argentina exporta carbonato de litio, que va directamente a la bateria que usan los vehiculos. Para llegar a la produccion de carbonato de litio se requiere un proceso quimico muy complejo, que demanda mano de obra calificada. Hoy la Argentina tiene plantas de carbonato de litio en la puna. Para seguir agregando mas valor en territorio es necesario disenar una estrategia conjunta como pais, porque eso traer asociado muchos desafios.  -Hay muchas personas que estan en contra de la mineria. ?Como tratan ese tema?  -A nivel nacional, hace mucho no se veia a todos los sectores de gobierno hablando de la mineria como una industria central para resolver parte de los problemas estructurales que tenemos. Comenzar a hablar de mineria es un paso importante para poder quitar ciertos temores a la sociedad. Otra parte relevante es la transparencia, por eso apostamos muy fuerte a medidas como el Siacam, el sistema de informacion abierta a la comunidad sobre la actividad minera, o la Memac, que es la mesa sobre mineria abierta. Son espacios no solo de dialogo, sino de transparencia para presentar toda la informacion y que la sociedad sea parte del dialogo y del monitoreo para hacer todas las preguntas que sean necesarias. La mineria se da en todas partes del mundo, Canada, Estados Unidos, Australia. Y la mineria es central para tener el tipo de vida que llevamos, para poder hacer la transicion energetica. No hay forma de vivir sin la mineria y tenemos que ver como llevarla adelante, de manera sustentable y en conjunto con la sociedad."}, {"source": "google-news-fr", "title": "Agression violente de Yuriy en 2021: les quatre mineurs juges reconnus coupables et condamnes - BFMTV", "text": "Les autres jeunes hommes - majeurs - mis en examen dans ce dossier seront juges en decembre prochain.

Jeudi 30 mars, l'Institut national de la statistique et des etudes economiques (Insee) a publie une somme d'etudes demographiques intitulee << Immigres et descendants d'immigres en France >>.  Une immigration qui augmente et se diversifie  Cet ouvrage permet d'apprecier les dynamiques a l'oeuvre dans un pays ou la part d'immigres dans la population est passee de 6,5 % a 10,3 % entre 1968 et 2021. Ce faisant, avec 7 millions de personnes, la France se situe dans la moyenne en Europe, ou des pays a forte immigration comme le Luxembourg, Malte et Chypre distancent des pays comme la Bulgarie ou la Roumanie, qui se situent a l'oppose.  INFOGRAPHIE LE MONDE  Leur profil a profondement evolue dans le temps. Alors qu'en France, en 1968, 72 % etaient originaires d'Europe du Sud et du Maghreb, ceux-ci representent aujourd'hui 45 % des immigres (en France vivent ainsi 887 000 immigres d'Algerie et 600 000 du Portugal). Depuis les annees 2000, ce sont en particulier les arrivees en provenance d'Asie et d'Afrique subsaharienne qui progressent. Facilitee par la libre circulation, l'immigration intra-europeenne est elle aussi dynamique. En 2021, 48 % de l'ensemble viennent d'Afrique, un tiers d'Europe et 14 % d'Asie.  INFOGRAPHIE LE MONDE  Les femmes, qui representaient 44 % de la population immigree en 1968, sont desormais une majorite (52 %).

Les motifs de venue en France se diversifient eux aussi. L'immigration familiale recule (elle ne represente plus qu'un tiers des nouveaux titres en 2021, contre la moitie en 2007) au profit de l'immigration etudiante - qui a represente pour la premiere fois le premier motif de venue en 2021 -, mais aussi professionnelle (13,3 % des titres delivres en 2021, trois fois plus qu'en 2007) et politique (14,6 %).  Des immigres plus touches par le chomage  Une fois en France, les immigres suivent des trajectoires sociales qui se distinguent de la population generale. Ils se concentrent dans les grandes aires urbaines et les departements frontaliers. A titre d'exemple, << alors que 10 % de la population francaise est immigree en 2020-2021, cette proportion atteint 20 % a Paris et 32 % en Seine-Saint-Denis >>, souligne l'Insee. Ils presentent en outre un desavantage net par rapport au reste de la population face a l'emploi. Alors qu'en 2021, 7 % des personnes ni immigrees ni descendantes d'immigres sont au chomage, c'est le cas de 13 % des immigres.  Il vous reste 62.33% de cet article a lire.

Sources said Amritpal was desperate to enter Amritsar for the last 48 hours and his family was camping at the Golden Temple for the last two days.  Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh has been absconding since over a week and the Punjab Police launched a massive manhunt against him and his associates.  By Manjeet Sehgal: Police in three Punjab districts -- Amritsar, Bhatinda and Rupnagar -- were on their toes after intelligence inputs that Khalistan separatist Amritpal Singh could surrender in any of the three popular Sikh shrines.  Amritpal could surrender at the Akal Takht at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Takht Damdama Sahib in Bathinda or Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib in Rupnagar district before Baisakhi eve, according to the Intel inputs.  advertisement  According to intel sources, Amritpal Singh was desperate to enter Amritsar for the past 48 hours.  Another link that hints that Amitpal Singh may surrender in Amritsar is the sudden disappearance of his family members from his ancestral home in Jallupur Kheda. The family members, according to the sources, were at the Golden Temple for the last two days.  STAYED AT DERA, USED ITS VEHICLE  Amritpal stayed at a Jalandhar dera and used its vehicles in a bid to enter Amritsar.  Sources say that Amritpal Singh and his aide Papalpreet Singh reached Jalandhar on March 27 and were staying at a dera linked to Takht Huzoor Sahib in Maharashtra's Nanded.  The duo used a Toyota Innova vehicle of this dera to reach Hoshiarpur reportedly for an interview with an international channel. The counterintelligence wing of Punjab Police started chasing the vehicle, which was stopped at Marnaian village under Mehtiyana police station limits.  While Amritpal Singh and Papalpreet Singh managed to escape in a Maruti Swift car, the police managed to arrest two dera men who were escorting Amritpal Singh in another vehicle.  The registration number of the Toyota Innova, which was used by Amritpal Singh to reportedly travel to Hoshiarpur, was later found to be fake.  The police have also impounded a Mahindra Scorpio vehicle which is believed to have been used by Amritpal Singh to travel from Uttarakhand to Jalandhar.  Police are now searching for the Maruti Swift car, which was used by Amritpal to escape from Hoshiarpur.  Having failed to trace Amritpal Singh after a massive search operation, police have now deployed drones to trace the Khalistan separatist and his aide.  WHEN WILL AMRITPAL SINGH SURRENDER?  All eyes were on Amritpal Singh, who, as per intelligence inputs, was keen on surrendering.  In an audio message that is said to be Amritpal's, the Waris Punjab De chief clarified that he was not afraid of police action and never said that he was fearing police torture or offering a conditional surrender. Punjab Police have also denied reports stating that the Khalistani separatist had put conditions for his surrender.  In a video message that was released on Wednesday, Amritpal appealed to the Akal Takht Jathedar to hold a 'Sarbat Khalsa' or Sikh congregation on Baisakhi.  advertisement  So when will Amritpal Singh exactly surrender? Is he planning to surrender on the eve of Baisakhi? Why is he asking the Akal Takht chief to hold a Sarbat Khalsa meeting?  It seems that Amritpal Singh is keen to surrender on Baisakhi eve, which is considered auspicious by the Sikhs.  Sources say that if Akal Takht considers his appeal, the Sarbat Khalsa could be held at Takht Sri Keshgarh Sahib (Anandpur Sahib) or at Takht Sri Damdama Sahib (Bathinda).  It is being said that Amritpal Singh wants to dramatise his surrender to get mileage out of it.  ALSO READ | Amritpal Singh dictating terms of surrender, is Akal Takht chief the mediator?

Intel inputs say that Amritpal Singh has been trying to enter Amritsar for the past two days and has been confined to a radius of 10 to 12 kilometres after he escaped from Hoshiarpur.

Evan Gershkovich was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg while allegedly trying to obtain classified information, the Federal Security Service, known by the acronym FSB, said Thursday.  Wall Street Journal journalist Evan Gershkovich has been arrested in Russia on suspicion of espionage. (AFP/Getty Images) (AFP/Getty Images)  The service, which is the top domestic security agency and main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, alleged that Gershkovich  was acting on the US orders to collect information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex that constitutes a state secret .  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday:  It is not about a suspicion, is it about the fact that he was caught red-handed .   The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter, Evan Gershkovich,  the newspaper said.   We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.   In a tweet and a statement, Blinken said the US government was  deeply concerned  over the detention.  Blinken said the US was in contact with The Wall Street Journal and was seeking consular access to the journalist.   In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,  he said.   The Department of State's highest priority is the safety and security of US citizens abroad.   The arrest comes at a moment of bitter tensions between the West and Moscow over its war in Ukraine and as the Kremlin intensifies a crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and civil society groups. The sweeping campaign of repression is unprecedented since the Soviet era.  Earlier this week, a Russian court convicted a father over social media posts critical of the war and sentenced him to two years in prison while his 13-year-old daughter was sent to an orphanage.  Gershkovich is the first American reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since September 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for US News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released without charge 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union's United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.  Daniil Berman, the lawyer of arrested Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, speaks to journalists near the Lefortovsky court, in Moscow, Russia, Thursday, March 30, 2023. (AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) (AP)  At a hearing on Thursday, a Moscow court quickly ruled to keep Gershkovich behind bars pending the investigation, according to the official Telegram channel of the capital's courts.  While previous American detainees have been freed in prisoner swaps, a top Russian official said it was way too early to talk about any such deal.  There was no immediate public comment from Washington, although a US official indicated the U.S. government was aware of the situation and awaiting more information from Russia.  Gershkovich, who covers Russia, Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations as a correspondent in The Wall Street Journal's Moscow bureau, could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of espionage. Prominent lawyers noted that past investigations into espionage cases in the past took a year to 18 months during which time he may be held with little contact with the outside world.  The FSB noted that Gershkovich had accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist, but ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Gershkovich was using his journalistic credentials as a cover for  activities that have nothing to do with journalism .

(AP Photo/Alexander Zemlianichenko) (AP)  Gershkovich speaks fluent Russian and had previously worked for the French agency Agence France-Presse and The New York Times . His last report from Moscow, published earlier this week, focused on the Russian economy's slowdown amid Western sanctions imposed when Russian troops invaded Ukraine last year.  Ivan Pavlov, a prominent Russian defence attorney who has worked on many espionage and treason cases, said Gershkovich is the first criminal case on espionage charges against a foreign journalist in post-Soviet Russia.   That unwritten rule not to touch accredited foreign journalists, has stopped working,  said Pavlov, a member of the First Department legal aid group.  Pavlov said the case against Gershkovich was built in order for Russia to have  trump cards  for a future prisoner exchange and will likely be resolved  not by the means of the law, but by political, diplomatic means .  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov ruled out any quick swap.   I wouldn't even consider this issue now because people who were previously swapped had already served their sentences,  Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies.  Gershkovich's arrest follows a swap in December, in which WNBA star Brittney Griner was freed after 10 months behind bars in exchange for Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.  Another American, Paul Whelan, a Michigan corporate security executive, has been imprisoned in Russia since December 2018 on espionage charges that his family and the US government have said are baseless.  Jeanne Cavelier, of press freedom group Reporters Without Borders, said Gershkovich's arrest  looks like a retaliation measure of Russia against the United States .   We are very alarmed because it is probably a way to intimidate all Western journalists that are trying to investigate aspects of the war on the ground in Russia,  said Cavelier, head of Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk at the Paris-based group.   The Western powers should immediately ask for clarifications on the charges, because as far as we know he was just doing his job as a journalist.   Russian journalist Dmitry Kolezev said on the messaging app Telegram that he spoke to Gershkovich before his trip to Yekaterinburg.   He was preparing for the usual, albeit rather dangerous in current conditions, journalist work,  Kolezev wrote.  He said Gershkovich asked him for the contacts of local journalists and officials in the area as he prepared to arrange interviews.  Another prominent lawyer with the First Department group, Yevgeny Smirnov, said that those arrested on espionage and treason charges are usually held at the FSB's Lefortovo prison in Moscow, known for its stringent conditions. It was Moscow's Lefortovo District Court that ruled behind closed doors to keep Gershkovich in custody.  Smirnov said espionage suspects are usually held in a total isolation, without phone calls, visitors or even access to newspapers. At most, they can receive letters, often delayed by weeks. Smirnov called these conditions  tools of suppression .  Smirnov and Pavlov both said that the investigation could last for 12 to 18 months, and the trial would be held behind closed doors.  'Pro-Russian' monks resist eviction order View Gallery  According to Pavlov, there have been no acquittals in treason and espionage cases in Russia since 1999.

Several vehicles were set on fire, stones thrown and shops ransacked as clashes between two groups broke out in West Bengal's Howrah amid Ram Navami celebrations on Thursday. Visuals showed several vehicles engulfed in flames and a heavy police deployment - including riot control force - in the area.  The violence broke out when a Ram Navami procession was crossing the Kazipara locality. A group of men in the rally were seen using sticks to deflect the stones thrown at them from a nearby roof. A number of cars, including a few police vehicles, were damaged during the violence and the security personnel had to fire tear gas shells to disperse the mob.  West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is on a two-day sit-in protest in Kolkata against Centre's policies, called  rioters the enemy of the country  and said those behind the violence  will not be spared .   Those who were involved in today's violence will not be spared. I do not support riot mongers and consider them the enemy of the country. The BJP has always targeted Howrah. The other targets for them are Park Circus and Islampur. Everybody must be alert in their localities,  she warned.  Senior BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, however, denied her allegations and blamed the Trinamool government for the violence.   The Chief Minister and the state administration are responsible for the violence,  Mr Adhikari said.  On Monday, the BJP slammed the Trinamool Congress for announcing protests on March 30, the day of Ram Navami celebrations. Suvendhu Adhikari, the BJP's leader in the state assembly, said those who believe in the  sanatan culture  will celebrate Ram's birth anniversary. Instead of declaring a holiday on the day, she has announced protests after making  fabricated and false  claims, he alleged.  Earlier in the day, Mamata Banerjee urged devotees to take out processions  peacefully .   I want to request that those who are taking out processions for Ram Navami today, please do but do it peacefully. Celebrate peacefully and don't try to create violence. Don't get provoked,  Ms Banerjee said from the stage on Day 2 of the dharna organised by her party.  The Trinamool chief began her protest in front of Dr BR Ambedkar's statue on Red Road area in the Bengal's capital city yesterday to protest against the Centre's alleged  stoppage  of funds to the state for MGNREGA and other schemes of the housing and road departments.  The day was overall peaceful, barring a few reports of violence from across the country. Some vehicles were damaged in Fatehpura area of Gujarat's Vadodara city on Thursday, police said. No one was injured in the incident and the procession passed along its planned route under police protection, said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Yashpal Jaganiya.  Last evening, a police team was attacked and several of their vehicles were set on fire during a violent clash between two groups in Maharashtra's Aurangabad last evening.

La HAS preconise que la vaccination contre la Covid-19 soit fortement recommandee pour les professionnels. La vaccination contre la diphterie, le tetanos, et la poliomyelite est egalement fortement recommandee pour les etudiants et les professionnels, sauf a Mayotte ou elle devrait rester obligatoire. Elle preconise enfin le maintien de l'obligation vaccinale pour l'hepatite B, et son extension aux professionnels liberaux.  La HAS a ete saisie par la Direction generale de la sante afin d'actualiser l'ensemble des obligations et recommandations vaccinales des professionnels des secteurs sanitaire et medico-social. Elle publie le premier volet de ses travaux, qu'elle consacre aux vaccins faisant actuellement l'objet d'une obligation vaccinale ; soit les vaccins contre la Covid-19, la diphterie, le tetanos, la poliomyelite et l'hepatite B. Sont concernes, les professionnels de sante, les professionnels qui exercent en etablissements de sante, structures sociales et medico-sociales dont ceux qui sont en contact etroit et repete avec des jeunes enfants.  Ces travaux de la HAS ont ete elabores sur la base d'arguments medicaux et scientifiques, sans prejuger de l'avis complementaire du Conseil consultatif national d'ethique pour les sciences de la vie et de la sante (CCNE). Le ministere de la Sante et de la Prevention a en effet saisi le CCNE sur les questions ethiques soulevees par les obligations vaccinales des professionnels, dont leur acceptabilite sociale et leurs consequences.  La HAS a notamment pris en compte les donnees epidemiologiques, la couverture vaccinale de la population generale et des professionnels, la disponibilite des vaccins et les dernieres donnees d'efficacite et de securite. Ces travaux ont ete enrichis par les tres nombreuses contributions des parties prenantes, issues de la consultation publique organisee entre le 20 fevrier et le 3 mars.  La HAS insiste sur le fait que la levee d'une obligation vaccinale pour les professionnels ne remet pas en question l'interet de cette vaccination, que ce soit en milieu professionnel ou en population generale.  Retrouvez ci-dessous une synthese de ces preconisations sur le perimetre de saisine de la HAS :  Pour la diphterie, le tetanos et la poliomyelite, la HAS preconise que : La vaccination DTP soit fortement recommandee chez les etudiants et professionnels, sauf a Mayotte ou elle devrait rester obligatoire. Pour l'hepatite B, la HAS preconise que : L'obligation d'immunisation concernant les etudiants soit maintenue a l'identique. La HAS rappelle qu'en consequence, la plupart des professionnels exposes a un risque de contamination par le virus de l'hepatite B ou susceptibles d'exposer les personnes prises en charge, sont deja immunises quand ils prennent leur poste de travail ; L'immunisation contre l'hepatite B soit rendue obligatoire pour les professionnels liberaux exercant leur activite hors d'un etablissement ou organisme de prevention ou de soins et qui sont susceptibles d'etre exposes a un risque de contamination ou d'exposer les personnes dont ils ont la charge ; L'obligation d'immunisation contre l'hepatite B soit maintenue a l'identique pour les professionnels exercant dans un etablissement ou organisme public ou prive de prevention ou de soin et qui sont exposes a un risque de contamination. Pour la Covid-19, la HAS preconise que : Soient respectes les recommandations du HCSP sur les gestes barrieres en milieu de soins. La vaccination contre la Covid-19 soit fortement recommandee, y compris les rappels a distance de la primovaccination, pour les etudiants et professionnels des secteurs sanitaire et medicosocial (exercant en etablissements ou liberaux) et les etudiants et professionnels des services de secours et d'incendie (notamment les sapeurs-pompiers professionnels et benevoles), en particulier pour les professions en contacts reguliers avec des personnes immunodeprimees ou vulnerables. Cette preconisation de lever l'obligation de vaccination contre la Covid-19 ne constitue en rien une remise en question de ses precedents avis et recommandations rendus dans des contextes sanitaires et epidemiques differents.  Plus largement, la HAS souligne que la vaccination ne remplace pas les autres mesures de prevention des infections des professionnels et des personnes avec lesquelles ils sont en contact. Le respect des mesures d'hygiene, l'utilisation d'un materiel adapte et de protections individuelles, la surveillance et la prise en compte des infections associees aux soins, ainsi que la formation des personnels pour prevenir ces risques constituent une priorite.    La HAS rappelle enfin, que ces preconisations sont susceptibles d'evoluer en fonction de l'evolution des donnees et du contexte sanitaire.  Un second volet consacre aux vaccins actuellement recommandes attendu pour juillet 2023  Le deuxieme volet de ses travaux, attendu pour juillet 2023, concernera les vaccinations actuellement recommandees pour les professionnels, a savoir ; les vaccins contre la coqueluche, la grippe, l'hepatite A, la rougeole, les oreillons, la rubeole et la varicelle.

Among the 19 others who were rescued alive following the mishap, some are said to be in critical condition.  The victims were part of a crowd that had gathered at the Shri Beleshwar Mahadev Jhulelal Temple in Indore's Patel Nagar area for Ram Navmi celebrations. The roof of the stepwell, that also served as the temple floor and was made of concrete slabs supported by iron rods, caved in due to the combined weight of too many devotees.  The Madhya Pradesh Government has ordered a probe into the incident and announced an ex-gratia amount of Rs5 lakh to be paid to the next of kin of the deceased, while Rs50,000 will be given to the injured.  'Guilty will be punished'   It was an old step well which was covered. 19 people have been rescued alive. This was an extremely tragic incident when 11 bodies were taken out from there [the step-well]. Of those who were rescued, one or two are said to be critical,  Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Narottam Mishra said, giving the status of the victims around 5:45 p.m. on Thursday evening.  Because the water had become muddy [due to debris mixing with shallow water], efforts are on to take out the [untraced] children who had gone missing... Whoever is found guilty in the probe will face action,  he added.   Around 11.45 am, the roof of the stepwell collapsed and nearly 50 people fell inside the step well... The covered part was a 16x16 feet structure and the depth was around 50 feet,  eyewitness Mahesh Gulani told a TV channel at the temple site. Three of Mr. Gulani's family members were among those trapped, and their fate remains unknown.  Temple expansion  Mr. Gulani added that the stepwell was at least 50 years old and that the temple next to it was an old structure which was later renovated to accommodate the step-well area by simply covering it. Bharatiya Janata Party national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya -- who hails from Indore and was also among the visitors at the temple -- told journalists that the temple in its expanded form had existed for over four decades and many visitors were likely not even aware that a step-well existed beneath its floors.  Rescue operations were reportedly affected by the narrow entry points and the fear of debris from nearby walls collapsing into the water.  Condolences  President Droupadi Murmu and leaders across the political spectrum expressed their condolences over the incident.   Extremely pained by the mishap in Indore. Spoke to CM @ChouhanShivraj Ji and took an update on the situation. The State Government is spearheading rescue and relief work at a quick pace.

While on this upward trend, Thursday (March 30) saw the country report its highest single-day case spike in nearly half a year!  In the last 24 hours, India logged 3,016 fresh COVID-19 cases, pushing the active caseload to 13,509. This marks a 40.2% jump in new infections compared to March 29, when 2,151 new cases were recorded nationwide.  Maharashtra, Kerala and Gujarat have reported the highest daily infection count in the past 24 hours. The health ministry bulletin also reported 14 deaths -- three from Maharashtra, two in Delhi, one in Himachal Pradesh and eight reconciled by Kerala.  While the national daily and weekly positivity rates were pegged at 2.73% and 1.71%, respectively, some states and union territories have notably deviated from these average figures.  Delhi, which logged 300 cases on Wednesday, reported a 14% positivity rate. This means that for every 100 persons tested in the national capital, 14 were COVID-positive. Alarmed by these developments, the Delhi government has called an emergency meeting on March 30 to review its COVID preparedness.  At the same time, Haryana has issued fresh guidelines for recording a suspected patient's complete travel history and extended the provisions of the Haryana Epidemic Disease and COVID-19 Regulation till March 31, 2024.  Experts blame waning immunity, lack of booster doses for the surge  Dr Rajeev Jayadevan, co-chairman of the National IMA COVID Task Force and former president of the Indian Medical Association, told IANS that the gradual waning of immunity, dropping of precautions and genetic mutations are some of the reasons behind the current surge.  Reiterating the need for basic precautions, he emphasised that people, especially older people, must keep away from crowded indoor gatherings and ill-ventilated spaces. Masking may also help reduce the virus' spread, he reminded.  The difficulty in containing COVID-19 lies primarily in its ability to repeatedly infect the same person, regardless of prior infection or vaccination. Hence,  multiple strategies must be followed at once to reduce the total disease burden in the community and hospitals,  Dr Jayadevan added.  Advertisement Experts also expressed worry about the uptake of booster doses in the country. As per the government's bulletin, 220.65 crore vaccine doses have been administered nationwide, and yet many people are yet to take a booster dose. In Maharashtra alone, less than one crore people have taken the precaution dose, leaving a substantial number of people vulnerable to existing COVID-19 variants.  WHO revises vaccination guidelines  Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) have revised the vaccination guidelines, bringing them in line with the high population-level immunity due to infection and vaccination.  This revised roadmap creates three priority groups for administering coronavirus vaccines -- high, medium and low.  The high-priority group includes older adults and younger people with significant comorbidities and immunocompromised people. The medium-priority group comprises healthy adults without comorbidities, along with children and adolescents with comorbidities. Lastly, healthy children and adolescents aged six months to 17 years fall in the low-priority group.  As per the guidelines, the high-risk group should get an additional booster between 6 to 12 months after their last vaccine. The primary series (two doses) and first booster doses are recommended for the medium-priority group. Healthy children and adolescents may not necessarily need a second booster shot apart from their primary doses.  With that said, the WHO has also urged countries to consider contextual factors such as disease burden, cost-effectiveness and other health priorities when deciding the vaccination programme for the latter age group.  While these revisions are yet to reflect in India's vaccination protocol, they may serve as a way to streamline booster dose administration to the most vulnerable chunk of the population.

Just two days before a verdict was to be given by the Surat court, the petitioner in the case, Surat BJP MLA Purnesh Modi, had sought recording of a further statement from Rahul in the same court, which was rejected. Twelve days later, he moved the High Court, appealing against the Surat court's rejection of his request and the stay came the same day as his appeal. Thereafter, the case remained pending at the HC for nearly a year, by which time a new chief judicial magistrate took over in a Surat court.  Must Read | Here is the election speech Rahul Gandhi was convicted, and has lost his MP seat for  Modi had then withdrawn his appeal in the HC and gone back to the Surat court, where the conviction came last week.  The sequence of events:  APRIL 2019  On April 13, 2019, Rahul Gandhi makes a speech in Kolar, Karnataka, while campaigning for the coming Lok Sabha elections, where he asks  how is it that all thieves have the Modi surname . He goes on to name Lalit Modi, Nirav Modi and Narendra Modi.  The next day, Purnesh Modi files a complaint before the Surat magistrate's court, accusing Rahul of defamation.  The case is first heard by Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) B H Kapadia, on June 7, 2019. Rahul is issued summons to appear before the court. In October, he appears before the court and pleads  not guilty  in the case.  On June 15, 2020, CJM A N Dave takes charge of the case, and begins recording testimony of witnesses.  Advertisement  CJM Dave examines two witnesses from Purnesh Modi's side -- D Shambhubhai Bhat, the joint chief electoral officer of Bengaluru during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections; and BJP worker P M Raghunath, who originally received the CD containing Rahul's speech from the election officer.  Modi files an application before the CJM court seeking to bring four more witnesses - a member of the video surveillance team attached to the Kolar district election office, Shivaswamy M; its videographer Arunkumar K R; TV9 special correspondent, Karnataka, Rajendra Simha; and Karnataka BJP leader Ganesh Yaji. Modi says their testimony is  essential to be examined to prove the contents of the electronic records (a pen drive and three CDs) as per the Evidence Act .  Last week, Raghunath was re-elected as working president of the south central zone of the New Delhi-headquartered Akhil Bhartiya Tailik Sahu Mahasabha. He told The Indian Express that he was  an RSS swayamsevak and a BJP office-bearer and a prime witness  in the case against Rahul. He also says the letter seeking records of Rahul's speech from the election office was sent through Yaji.  Advertisement   I took the certified CDs, and my son couriered them to Purnesh, who then gave them to the Surat court,  Raghunath says.  In the Surat court, CJM Dave refuses Purnesh Modi's application to bring new witnesses, observing that it appeared to be on the same grounds as the earlier application,  to prove the same facts... since certain questions with respect to proof of electronic records were put by the defence counsel  to earlier witnesses.  The CJM holds that  the complainant has examined an adequate number of witnesses to prove his case  and that since the new application was for proof of  the same facts , it is not necessary to examine the new witnesses.  Modi appeals before the CJM seeking a stay on his order. Without giving a stay, the court adjourns the matter to January 16, 2021.  JANUARY 2021  On January 12, 2021, Purnesh Modi moves the Gujarat High Court challenging CJM Dave's rejection of his application to examine four additional witnesses. The court of Justice B N Karia issues a notice to the state of Gujarat and Rahul on January 16, 2021, returnable on March 16, 2021.  Advertisement  Meanwhile, cross-examination of witnesses and recording of evidence in the Surat court continues.  Then, on July 9, 2021, the Gujarat HC directs the trial court to  not proceed further  till Modi's application before it is decided.  Advertisement  On August 17, 2021, the court of Justice Ilesh Vora quashes the Surat court CJM's order of January 5, 2021, and holds that  the persons named in the application (the four witnesses) are essential to be examined for a just decision of the case . The HC also sends back Modi's plea for summoning and examining of additional witnesses to the trial court.  In his order, Justice Vora says the dismissal of Modi's application by the trial court was  not in consonance with the object and scope as prescribed under Section 311 of the CrPC (dealing with examination of witnesses) and dictum of law settled by the Apex Court . The HC says the electronic evidence is required to be proved as it is the magistrate's court  who directed the complainant to prove the admissibility of electronic record following mandatory provisions like Section 65 B of the Evidence Act .  Advertisement  The HC adds that deposition of Shambhubhai Bhat (the joint chief electoral officer, Bengaluru) showed that the Kolar Election Office prepared three CDs.  Under the circumstances, the witness from the Kolar Election Office seems to be essential to prove the contents of the electronic record.  The court observes that while there are no  hard and fast rules  for exercising discretion under Section 311 of the CrPC  as it depends on the facts of each case , but  the court has to apply its judicial mind while exercising its discretion keeping in mind the concept of fair trial .  He adds that  fair trial includes grant of fair and proper opportunities to the person concerned .  Rahul's lawyer Pankaj Champaneri argues against the maintainability of Modi's petition, submitting that the magistrate's order suffered from no jurisdictional illegality or impropriety. Champaneri says Purnesh Modi filed the petition before the HC as  an afterthought . He argues that Modi never applied for certified copies of electronic records, and calls his appeal before the HC an attempt to  abuse the process of law and Court... to fill up the lacuna remained in the case .  OCTOBER 2021  With Purnesh Modi's petition remitted back to it, on October 29, 2021, CJM Dave partially accepts his request. The Surat court summons two of the witnesses listed by him -- Karnataka state BJP office secretary Yaji, and Shivaswamy M, one of the members of the video surveillance team working with the election authorities.  Yaji says he was assigned additional duties during the 2019 elections by the BJP, including attending rallies of leaders of the party and other parties, noting down who said what, and preparing a report to be sent to the central BJP office. Yaji submits in his testimony that he attended Rahul's April 13, 2019, at Kolar in this context.  FEBRUARY 2022  CJM Dave sets the verdict date for February 25, 2022. Two days before that, Purnesh Modi moves an application before the court, seeking that Rahul explain the contents of the electronic records related to his speech as per provisions of the CrPC Section 313, and that this be recorded as a further statement by the Congress leader. Dave rejects the same.  The same day, Modi also moves an application before the court to adjourn the matter so that he can approach the HC. This too is rejected.  MARCH 2022  On March 7, 2022, Purnesh Modi again moves the Gujarat HC, this time challenging the CJM's order of February 23, rejecting his application for further statement by Rahul under CrPC Section 313. Modi also submits that the magistrate is not granting him any adjournment and requests the HC for a stay on the trial.  The petition is filed, registered and presented before the HC for hearing all on the same day. Justice Vipul Pancholi grants a stay on the trial, issuing a notice.  On May 19, 2022, CJM Dave is replaced with CJM H H Varma in the Surat trial court.  FEBRUARY 2023  The matter remains pending in the HC till February 16 this year, when Purnesh Modi himself withdraws his petition. The HC then vacates the stay.  Harshit Tolia, Modi's advocate in the HC, says they withdrew the petition  because we realised sufficient evidence had been brought on record  and as  a law-abiding citizen, we felt it was our duty to comply with the Supreme Court order  on conducting expeditious trials of cases involving MPs/MLAs.  The Surat trial court of CJM Varma then puts up the case for final arguments from February 21, and concludes these on March 17.  On March 23, CJM Varma orders Rahul's conviction. Rahul is present in court.  Questioning the order, Rahul's lawyer Kirit Panwala says:  There is no mention in the judgment whether the electronic evidence was proved or not. The court has not given a clear finding as to whether it believes the electronic evidence or not. The court has merely written that apart from electronic evidence, there is other evidence that can be considered. Nor was there any definite order from the magistrate court on whether the electronic evidence has been admitted or not. This is one of the grounds on which we will be challenging the verdict.

Ainda segundo o militar, assim que se aproximaram do tumulo, que e na vertical como na maioria dos cemiterios antigos em que os jazigos ficam nas paredes, ele ouviu uma voz.   No primeiro momento, nao acreditei. Estava ouvindo uma voz saindo do tumulo. Mas nao tive medo e nem pensei que pudesse ser uma alma penada. Percebi que o fechamento do tumulo estava diferente. Nao era com tijolos, como a maioria. Eram lajotas. Ai, falei com o meu parceiro, o soldado Guilherme e chamamos um pedreiro que trabalhava em outro tumulo, pedindo para abrir aquele , conta ele.

Selected No. 3 overall in the 2018 draft by the Jets, Darnold failed to live up to lofty expectations in three seasons with New York. In 2021, he was traded to Carolina, where he mostly struggled for two more seasons.  Still just 25 years old, Darnold is 21-34 as starter, completing 59.7% of his passes for 11,767 yards, with 61 touchdowns and 55 interceptions for a shoulder-shrugging 78.2 career passer rating.  Darnold did help the Panthers finish 4-2 in the final six games of the 2022 regular season, with Carolina just missing out on a postseason berth.   It was just playing patient,  he said about that stretch during his introductory press conference with San Francisco.  That was the biggest difference for me. Not forcing things when they weren't there. Because when you turn the ball over and force the ball in there, you can't have a chance late in the game.   With both Trey Lance and Brock Purdy recovering from injuries, Shanahan needed another healthy arm. And after finishing the NFC Championship Game without a healthy quarterback, the 49ers secured a third competent option for a team built to make a Super Bowl run.   Sam has as good of a skill set as there is,  Shanahan told reporters at the NFL owners meetings in Phoenix this week.  That's why he went as the third pick in the draft. When you study his play, you can see it, too. I don't think he's always been in the best situations, which is tough for quarterbacks. It's tough for all players.  ADVERTISEMENT   Sam has played and done some good things in this league. He hasn't won a ton of games. He's been put in some situations where you're going to keep both teams in the game because you have to keep slinging the ball to give yourself a chance to win, so you don't always have the best stats. But you see the ability, and he's always had that ability since his first year in college when we started watching him. And there's no reason he can't do it.   For the first time in his career, Darnold will be coached by one of the best offensive minds in the business in Shanahan. And there's no pressure. Lance and Purdy are expected to battle it out for the starting job once both are healthy, while Darnold provides insurance should those two suffer injuries again in 2023.  The 23-year-old Purdy suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow during the opening quarter of his team's NFC title game loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. The Iowa State product had surgery on March 10 and will work through a recovery that could range from six-to-eight months. Purdy is rehabbing at home in Arizona.  Shanahan said the QB should start throwing in June. Based on how Purdy played during the second half of last season, both general manager John Lynch and Shanahan said he would be the 2023 starter if healthy. Shanahan is taking a wait-and-see approach to Purdy's return, with the potential that the second-year pro will not ready at the start of the regular season.  Is Purdy the QB of the future in San Francisco? Colin Cowherd reacts to 49ers GM John Lynch saying that Brock Purdy has  earned the right  to start at quarterback after his performance last year.  After being the last pick of the 2022 draft, Purdy was pressed into service midseason after both Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo were injured. Purdy went 7-1 as the starter during the second half, completing 66.5% of his passes for 1,943 yards, with 16 touchdowns and just four interceptions for a 108.0 passer rating.   Brock played in eight games,  Shanahan said.  Trey had that job going into last season, and if he would have played eight games like that, no one else would have come in to beat him out. But with Brock being hurt, it does open it up and give [Lance] a chance.   I don't know how Brock is going to come back. I don't know exactly when he's going to come back. I don't have the exact answer to that. But right now because he's hurt, it's nice to focus on Trey. It's nice to focus on Sam and see how they do in OTAs and most likely see how they are playing in training camp. Because I think it will take some time for Brock.   Lance, 22, was anointed the starter at the beginning of the 2022 regular season, but he suffered a season-ending broken ankle in Week 2 against the Seattle Seahawks that required two surgeries to fix. The North Dakota State product is expected to be fully healthy at the start of offseason work next month.  Shanahan said Lance and Darnold will both get first-team reps during phase one of organized team activities in April.  Lance has played in just eight games since being the No. 3 overall pick of the 2021 draft. The Niners gave up three first-round picks and a third-rounder to the Miami Dolphins in a trade up the draft board to get him. Despite all of Lance's injures, Shanahan says the philosophy of relying on signal-callers on their rookie deals and building the team around them has worked.   We knew all of these guys were coming up [for contracts],  Shanahan said.  You can't keep all of those guys if you don't have a quarterback on a rookie deal. So we saw where all this was going, and we made a decision to go to a rookie quarterback a few years ago. That was Trey.   That's what allowed us to add Mooney [Charvarius Ward], a free-agent corner last year. It's what will allow us to re-sign [Nick] Bosa. It's what allowed us to sign [Javon) Hargrave, and to have a high-paid left tackle [Trent Williams], tight end [George Kittle] and receiver [Deebo Samuel]. That's why we went for Trey.   Purdy's high level of play as a rookie allowed the 49ers to continue on that team-building path. Darnold now joins that group, providing added insurance at a low cost.   We feel like we're in a very good situation at quarterback,  Shanahan said.  Not only with three guys that are capable of being starters, but we also have three guys that have allowed us to build a very good roster. And I feel any of those three, with how our roster is, can get in, play at a certain level.   I feel like we can win with any of those guys.   Eric D.

At the same time, they can't be too worried about their roster.  Over the past year, the team has traded for receiver Tyreek Hill, edge Bradley Chubb, cornerback Jalen Ramsey and running back Jeff Wilson. It's a star-studded cast to add to a roster that already included tackle Terron Armstead, cornerback Xavien Howard, receiver Jaylen Waddle, edge Jaelan Phillips and defensive tackle Christian Wilkins.  Miami doesn't have a first-round pick, having been stripped of it for tampering with Tom Brady and Sean Payton. But that doesn't mean general manager Chris Grier won't keep thing interesting. In fact, I'd be shocked if the Dolphins stood pat with their four picks. My sense is that they'll move around the draft board -- likely eyeing a move down with one or both of their Day 2 picks (in the second and third rounds).  So let's dive into my first mock draft of the offseason for Miami.  Round 2, Pick 51: Steve Avila, guard, TCU  I'm excited about this pick. My initial plan was to trade back, but ultimately Avila proved too tempting. My plan to acquire additional picks will have to play out in the later rounds. Avila was a three-year starter at TCU. I suspect he could edge out Liam Eichenberg and start at left guard on Day 1.  To get a Day 1 starter in the middle of the second round? Well, that's not bad at all.  ADVERTISEMENT  Round 3, Pick 97: Jartavius Martin, CB, Illinois  Let's talk about some trades, folks.  I made back-to-back trades. The Chargers called. They wanted to jump up one spot. I was happy to oblige. But I didn't stop there. Washington was on the phone as soon as L.A. made its selection. I picked up what the Commanders were putting down.  When the dust settled, I remained in the third round after moving back 13 slots. In the process, I acquired fifth- and sixth-round picks. It's nothing special. But it was worthwhile.  I was pleased with that movement. But once I found myself in the spot, I was unsure of what to do here. There was a consistent coverage safety in Georgia's Christopher Smith. There was a developmental speedster WR in Cincinnati's Tyler Scott. (When has Grier passed on the opportunity to get a good WR?)  But let's get after that cornerback room. Noah Igbinoghene isn't getting it done. Martin isn't just a cornerback either. He can also play safety. There are a few different ways where he can contribute on defense. The biggest question is whether he'll be able to play outside. But with Howard and Ramsey, the Dolphins have time to develop Martin to see if he can grow into that role (or another) on the defense. In the meantime, he can help at slot CB and safety.  Round 5, Pick 150: Luke Schoonmaker, TE, Michigan  I'm really glad Schoonmaker was still available here. He is one of the best athletes in this year's class and a willing and able run-blocker. That could get him on the field early in his Dolphins career in Mike McDaniel's system that often leaves behind receiving-type tight ends. (See: Mike Gesicki.)  At 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, Schoonmaker has yet to develop the killer instinct that he needs at receiver. He doesn't attack the ball and that costs him catches. That will be Miami's main point of focus in developing him into a three-down option.  As an aside, one thing I've noticed in this particular mock draft is that the running backs are falling. I passed on Alabama's Jahmyr Gibbs in Round 2, Ole Miss' Zach Evans in Round 3 and Georgia's Kenny McIntosh at this point. I just can't justify swinging and possibly missing on an RB. There are so many running backs in free agency. I don't need to find my RB of the future when Zeke Elliott, Leonard Fournette and Kareem Hunt are free agents.  Round 6, Pick 197: Keaton Mitchell, RB, East Carolina  Here's a fun fact: Mitchell led the FBS with 54 runs of 10-plus yards in 2022, per PFF.  This is such a fun and fascinating match for the Dolphins' offense. This dude ran a 4.37-second 40-yard dash. He's only 5-foot-8, so he's not the kind of player that's going to assume three-down back status. But as a complement to Raheem Mostert and/or Jeff Wilson? Mitchell is pretty perfect.  The biggest point of development for Mitchell will be third-down duties. He has struggled with drops and pass protection. He's not the type of player that can instantly earn a pass-catching role, even with all his speed.  Round 6, Pick 200: Jaxson Kirkland, OL, Washington  Time will tell whether Kirkland can be an NFL guard or tackle (or neither). He's 6-foot-7 and 320 pounds, so he has the frame for either position. But his height led to issues in his college film, which is what complicates a transition to guard. He might be a bit of a tweener. That's why the Dolphins can take a risk on him in the sixth round.  Round 7, Pick 238: Cam Jones, ILB, Indiana  Jones reminds me of Elandon Roberts, who ended up signing with the Pittsburgh Steelers this offseason. Roberts entered the league with the Patriots as a late-round draft pick and special-teams contributor. And though he was undersized, his physicality eventually made him valuable on early downs.  That could be Jones' path in Miami. He's a standup teammate, with three years of captain experience. But there's plenty for him to work on if he's going to overcome his size issues (6-foot-1, 225 pounds).

The 2023 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament has been one for the ages, with 4-seed UConn , 5-seeds Miami (Fla.) and San Diego State and 9-seed Florida Atlantic the last teams standings in one of the most unpredictable Final Fours in tourney history.  With that, we've rounded up the numbers you need to know before the action gets underway Saturday in Houston.  View the full bracket here.  GAMBLING NOTES  All stats using data from FOX Bet.  4-0: UConn, Miami and SDSU are perfect against the spread (ATS) in this tournament thus far.  ADVERTISEMENT  3-1: FAU's record ATS in this tournament, as the Owls didn't cover in their second-round win against Fairleigh Dickinson.  12-9-1: Underdogs' record ATS in the Final Four since 2012. Underdogs are 6-16 straight-up (SU).  17: The number of times in the past 18 Final Fours that one of the two favorites entering the weekend went on to win the national championship. UConn is currently favored to win it all, followed by SDSU. (The one exception was in 2014, when UConn won it all despite being a 6.5-point underdog against Florida in the Final Four.)  +34,600: Each of the Final Four teams' national title odds combined entering the tournament, which is the third-highest total since 1976. With a title win, FAU -- listed at 200-1 entering the tournament this year -- would be the team with the longest pre-tournament odds to have ever won.  4: Only four teams with greater than 20-1 odds entering the tournament have won the title: 95-1 UConn (2014), 25-1 UConn (2011), 35-1 Villanova (1985) and 25-1 North Carolina State (1983).  0: This will be the first Final Four without a single McDonald's All-American since 1979, the same year seeding began.  1954: The last time two teams (La Salle and Penn State) from the same state made their Final Four debut.  9-2: Miami's record ATS this season when an underdog. The Hurricanes are 20-5 ATS as underdogs over the past two seasons and 33-12 ATS as underdogs in the past three seasons.  14-1: UConn's record ATS against nonconference opponents this year. However, the Huskies are 15-0 SU.  OVERALL NOTES  All stats are in the seeding era (since 1979).  3: This year marks the first time three teams will be making their first-ever Final Four appearance (Miami, FAU, San Diego State)  0: There is no 1-, 2- or 3-seed in the Final Four for the first time ever, and it is just the fourth Final Four with no 1-seed. The previous three Final Fours without a 1-seed were won by UConn (2011), Florida (2006), Louisville (1980).  23: This is the second-highest seed total of any Final Four (23). In 2011, No. 3 UConn, No. 4 Kentucky, No. 8 Butler and No. 11 VCU had a seed total of 26.  1: This is the first time that two teams from Florida have made the Final Four in the same tournament. University of Miami's campus, located in Coral Gables, and FAU's campus, located in Boca Raton, are separated by a mere 52 miles.  2: This will be the second Final Four in the seeding era to feature two 5-seeds. The first came in 2010, with Michigan State and Butler both making the Final Four as 5-seeds.  1: A 4- and 5-seed have met once prior in the Final Four, in 1996, with No. 4 Syracuse defeating No. 5 Mississippi State. On the other side, a 5- and 9-seed have never met in the Final Four.  1-2: Conference USA teams are 1-2 all time in the Final Four.  1: SDSU will be the first team from the Mountain West to play in the Final Four.  No. 9 Florida Atlantic (35-3) vs. No. 5 San Diego State (31-6), 6:09 p.m. ET, CBS  Matchup overview: Both FAU and SDSU will be making their first appearance in the Final Four in their program's history. With a win, the Owls would be first 9-seed to win in the Final Four and therefore be the first 9-seed all-time to make the national championship game. However, entering Saturday's game, 9-seeds are 0-2 all-time in the Final Four.  2: FAU would become just the second Conference USA team to make it to the national championship game, joining Memphis (now in American Athletic Conference) in 2008, with a win in the Final Four.  6: With a win, FAU would make it to the national championship game with just six games played in the tournament all time, which would be the fewest tournament games played by a team that makes the national championship since Indiana State, which made its tournament debut in 1979 having won four games en route to playing for the national title (fifth game).  4: San Diego State would be the fourth 5-seed all-time to win in the Final Four, joining Butler (2010), Indiana (2002) and Florida (2000).  57.3: The number of points the Aztecs are allowing this tournament, which is the second-best among all teams and best among the Final Four teams. (Tennessee allowed 56.3 PPG in three tournament games this year.)  No. 4 UConn (29-8) vs. No. 5 Miami (29-7), 8:49 p.m. ET, CBS  Matchup overview: UConn is making its sixth Final Four appearance and first since winning it all in 2014. The Huskies are 4-1 all time in the Final Four, with the lone loss coming in 2009. On the other side, Miami is making its Final Four debut.  5-1: With a win, UConn would improve to 5-1 all-time in the Final Four, breaking a tie with Georgetown (4-1) for the second-best record among teams with minimum five appearances. Michigan is 7-1 all time in the Final Four.  4: UConn would be fourth 4-seed all-time to win in the Final Four, joining Michigan (2013), Arizona (1997) and Syracuse (1996). What's more, a win would make UConn the first 4-seed to make national championship game in a decade.  81.8: The number of points per game UConn is averaging this tournament, which is the third-best among all teams and best among the Final Four teams. (In two tournament games, Arizona State posted 84 PPG and Kansas posted 83.5 PPG.)  41.8: The percentage that the Huskies are shooting from the 3-point line, which is the highest among the Final Four teams.  3: Miami's Jim Larranaga is just the third coach in NCAA history to take two programs (Miami and George Mason) to the Final Four, joining Forddy Anderson (Bradley and Michigan State) and Hugh Durham (Florida State and Georgia).  81.3: The number of points per game Miami is scoring this tournament, which is the fifth-best among all teams and second-best among the Final Four teams.  3: Of the remaining four teams in the tournament, the Hurricanes have three of the top-six leading scorers: Nijel Pack (18.5 PPG), Isaiah Wong and Jordan Miller (16.5 PPG). UConn has two in Adama Sanogo (20.0 PPG) and Jordan Hawkins (17.3 PPG), and FAU has one in Johnell Davis (17.3 PPG).

Iowa's junior guard, though, saved her best performance for the game's biggest stage, recording the first 40-point triple-double in NCAA history to get Iowa to the Final Four for the first time in 30 years.  Clark was honored Thursday as The Associated Press women's basketball Player of the Year. She received 20 votes from the 28-member national media panel that votes on the AP Top 25 each week. Voting was done before March Madness began.   It's a huge honor,  Clark said.  I picked a place that I perfectly fit into and that's allowed me to show my skill set. I'd be lying if I said it didn't mean something. It's not the reason you play basketball, it's just something that comes along with getting to do what you love.   The Iowa coaching staff surprised Clark by sharing that she won the award while they were visiting the Iowa Children's Hospital -- a place near and dear to her. It also has huge ties to the Hawkeyes athletic department.  They put together a video of some of the children in the hospital congratulating Clark on an outstanding season, and in the middle of it, Iowa coach Lisa Bluder popped on the screen to tell her she won.   I'm there for inspiring the next generation and being there for the people that you know are going through a hard time,  said Clark, who grew up in Iowa.  Being able to give joy to people that watch you play and watch your team play is amazing.   ADVERTISEMENT  She averaged 27 points, 8.3 assists and 7.5 rebounds during the season to help Iowa go 26-6. Clark has 984 points, the sixth-most in a season by any player in Division I women's history. She also has over 300 assists.   She is spectacular. I don't know how else to describe what she does on the basketball court,  Bluder said.  Next up for the Hawkeyes is undefeated South Carolina in the national semifinals. The Gamecocks are led by Aliyah Boston, last season's winner of the award. She garnered the other eight votes this season.   There [are] so many great players, more than just me and (Aliyah),  Clark told the AP.  You can go on and on and list the tremendous players. I think that's really good for our game when there [are] a lot of great players. That's what is going to help this game grow more than anything else.   Whether it's hitting deep 3s from the Hawkeye logo at home games, hitting off-balance game-winning shots or throwing pinpoint passes to teammates for easy baskets, Clark has excelled on the court this year to get Iowa to a place it hasn't been in a long time.   It's funny, because the better the opponent, almost the better she plays,  Bluder said.  It's like she locks in on those, when we're playing against Top 25 teams. That's when her statistics even go up even more, against great opponents.   Clark is the second Iowa player to win the AP award in the past few seasons, joining Megan Gustafson, who won it in 2019.

Saturday's first game between Florida Atlantic and San Diego State is a true toss-up.  Meanwhile, the second matchup pits former Big East rivals Miami and UConn against one another.  We're in line for a great weekend of games, so let's take a look at my best wagers for the national semifinals and some other betting tidbits, with odds by FOX Bet.  Florida Atlantic vs. San Diego State, 6:09 p.m. ET Sunday  FAU's Nick Boyd is second on the team with 64 3-pointers but has struggled in the tourney, going 6-for-23 (26.1%). One would think he's due to hit some  positive regression,  even against an Aztecs team that has held opponents to 5-for-44 shooting (11.4%) on 3-pointers the past two games.  While the San Diego State defense deserves credit for that, some of the misses were good looks which just didn't fall - see Trey Alexander for Creighton. It's not like I expect Boyd to go 5-for-7 shooting, but I do think making two - as he did vs. Tennessee - isn't too much to ask.  ADVERTISEMENT  PICK: FAU's Nick Boyd Over 1.5 made 3-pointers (-110 at FOX Bet, bet $10 to win $19.09 total)  The Owls have eclipsed 65.5 points in three of their four tournament games, with only the Tennessee game going under the number. FAU scored 62 in that game which saw the Owls put together a brutal first half with 22 points and 3-for-14 shooting from 3-point range (21.4%).  Yes, I know the Aztecs possess a great defense, allowing only 57.3 points per game in the tourney, but this is a Final Four game, so if the Owls are trailing late, there will be a lot of fouls, more possessions to shoot 3s and more points scoring opportunities. Or the flip side could happen, and FAU could be up, and it's the Aztecs doing the fouling.  Either way, I think the Over is the way to go here.  PICK: FAU Over 65.5 points scored (-110 at FOX Bet, bet $10 to win $19.09 total)  Connecticut vs. Miami, 8:49 p.m. ET Sunday  Miami has been thriving in the underdog role in the tournament, pleading,  Don't Pick Us,  as the 'Canes have knocked off the 1-seed (Houston), 2-seed (Texas) and 4-seed (Indiana).  Well, Miami has another opportunity to pull an upset here and hope people will listen to their pleas, as the 'Canes are a 5.5-point underdog against Connecticut. The Huskies have looked like the best team in the tournament so far, so the number makes sense.  But, don't let this underdog bit fool you. Miami is good - very good. In fact, this team hasn't lost when it has been at full strength since Jan. 28 at Pitt. Norchad Omier played but a minute in the ACC semifinal loss against Duke, and Nijel Pack did not play when the Canes blew a big lead to Florida State on Feb. 25.  Sonny Vaccaro shares how Michael Jordan's GW-shot vs. Georgetown 'changed the world' Former Nike executive Sonny Vaccaro (the man who discovered Michael Jordan) joined Colin Cowherd.  If Duke, Louisville, North Carolina or Virginia did that, they would be viewed as an ACC powerhouse. But as has happened in the past, especially with seeding in the NCAA Tournament, Miami can't seem to get that same level of respect despite its ACC success.  Don't expect the 'Canes to go quietly here either, in what should be a high-scoring game. UConn has eight players averaging at least six points per game and 13 minutes per game in the tourney, so they are deep and can score with anyone. Miami is also very difficult to guard and just put up 85 points on Indiana, 89 on Houston and 88 on Texas.  If this game isn't well into the 70s or even the 80s I would be surprised.  PICK: Miami (+5.5 at FOX Bet) to lose by fewer than 5.5 points (or win outright)  PICK: Over 149 points scored by both teams combined at FOX Bet  Bear Bytes  Over the previous six Final Fours, only two teams have pulled an upset in the national semifinals - North Carolina last year as a 4.5-point dog against Duke and Texas Tech in 2019 as a two-point dog against Michigan State.  Seven of the 12 games were decided by double digits in that span. So look for some adjusted lines where you could get some plus prices.  Each of the past five - and seven of the past eight - ACC teams that did not play another ACC team in the national semifinals won their game to reach the championship game.  FAU can become the first 9-seed - and the lowest seed ever - to reach the National Championship Game. Five 8-seeds have reached the title game, including North Carolina last year.

And since this is baseball, what happens next is anyone's guess. With that, our MLB staff offered their predictions on 2023 MVPs, Cy Youngs, rookies of the year, pennant winners and the World Series champion.  Here are their picks.  American League MVP  Rowan Kavner: Shohei Ohtani, Angels  Jake Mintz: Ohtani  Pedro Moura: Mike Trout  Jordan Shusterman: Jose Ramirez, Guardians  Deesha Thosar: Ohtani  Ben Verlander: Ohtani  Last year's winner: Aaron Judge  Judge brought a reprieve for Angels players winning the award in 2022, hitting an AL record 62 home runs last season. Prior to that, either one of Ohtani or Trout won the award in four of the eight previous seasons. Following another historic 2022 campaign and a memorable World Baseball Classic run, Ohtani is again the favorite to win the award at +250.  National League MVP  ADVERTISEMENT  Kavner: Ronald Acuna, Braves  Mintz: Fernando Tatis Jr., Padres  Moura: Mookie Betts, Dodgers  Shusterman: Juan Soto, Padres  Thosar: Trea Turner, Phillies  Verlander: Soto  Last year's winner: Paul Goldschmidt  Unlike the AL MVP, the NL MVP is a bit of a more open race entering the season. Soto is currently the favorite on FOX Bet with +550 odds, but Betts (+900), Acuna (+1000), Tatis (+1000), Turner (+1100), Manny Machado (+1100) and Nolan Arenado (+1100) aren't too far behind.  AL Cy Young  Kavner: Gerrit Cole, Yankees  Mintz: Cole  Moura: Ohtani  Shusterman: Ohtani  Thosar: Framber Valdez, Astros  Verlander: Valdez  Last year's winner: Justin Verlander  Could Ohtani become the first pitcher since Verlander in 2011 to win both AL MVP and Cy Young? It's certainly a possibility, as he's also been one of the game's top pitchers over the past couple of seasons. Cole and Valdez are also aiming for their first Cy Young, while Jacob deGrom could join rare air and win the award in both leagues.  NL Cy Young  Kavner: Spencer Strider, Braves  Mintz: Strider  Moura: Sandy Alcantara, Marlins  Shusterman: Brandon Woodruff, Brewers  Thosar: Strider  Verlander: Strider  Last year's winner: Alcantara  Just like with the NL MVP, the NL Cy Young race has several strong candidates entering the season. Alcantara is only 27 and continues to improve. Last year's AL winner (Verlander) is now in the senior circuit. Strider was one of the best pitchers in baseball last season as a rookie. And Max Scherzer has won three Cy Youngs in the past and continues to pitch at a high level.  AL Rookie of the Year  Kavner: Gunnar Henderson, Orioles  Moura: Henderson  Mintz: Anthony Volpe, Yankees  Shusterman: Masataka Yoshida, Red Sox  Thosar: Volpe  Verlander: Henderson  Last year's winner: Julio Rodriguez  There are a lot of candidates for this award coming out of the AL East. Yoshida was arguably the best hitter in the WBC. Volpe is the Yankees' most-hyped prospect in recent history and will be their Opening Day shortstop. Henderson flashed in the brief action he saw last season. The Red Sox's Triston Casas and the Orioles' Grayson Rodriguez are also among those listed among the top five in betting odds to win the award.  NL Rookie of the Year  Kavner: Miguel Vargas, Dodgers  Mintz: Corbin Carroll, Diamondbacks  Moura: Carroll  Shusterman: Carroll  Thosar: Jordan Walker, Cardinals  Verlander: Carroll  Last year's winner: Michael Harris II  Like Henderson, Carroll stood out as a late-season call-up in 2022. Vargas will factor into the mix for the Dodgers this season, perhaps as their everyday second basemen. Walker is one of the best prospects in baseball and will get his first big-league action right away, as the Cardinals placed him on their Opening Day roster.  World Series winner  Kavner: Braves over Blue Jays  Mintz: Braves over Yankees  Moura: Astros over Dodgers  Thosar: Phillies over Astros  Shusterman: Astros over Padres  Verlander: Astros over Braves  Last year's winner: Astros over Phillies in six games.  While a few teams have established themselves as perennial contenders, there's been a lot of parity in recent seasons as it concerns winning the World Series. Only the Astros have won multiple tittles since 2014, and no team has won back-to-back crowns since the Yankees in 2000.  Let the games begin.

That's what happens when you smash 62 home runs and a bunch of records along the way, and when you land a whopper of a contract valued at $360 million, and when you become the captain of the New York Yankees.  Shohei Ohtani is the best and most fascinating player in baseball, but as the MLB campaign gears up for a busy first act, Judge is the most visible, on account of the season he's coming off, the market he plays in, the expectations of the team he plays for and yeah, all those zeroes on his hard-earned contract.  For some extra spice, there is a delicious little storyline to blast things off with, a devilish twist that sees the Yankees begin their year against the San Francisco Giants, the team that took a hefty swing at prying Judge away from the Bronx over the winter.   This (Opening Day) is a bigger stage than I think people are even giving it credit for,  Giants manager Gabe Kapler told reporters.  The Giants went in big for Judge, confident they could sway him. The money they offered essentially reset his market, with an offer of $40 million per year over nine seasons, besting the Yankees' original carrot of the same annual amount spread over eight.  Although the San Diego Padres ultimately proposed a reported $400 million over 10 years, Judge opted to remain in the Big Apple when Hal Steinbrenner agreed to match what was being offered in the Bay Area.  ADVERTISEMENT  It was a disappointment for the Giants, for whom a Judge signing would have been transformative, and who thought the chance for the slugger to return to his Californian roots would come into play.  From being seemingly poised to instantly become one of the most relevant teams in baseball, San Francisco is instead being projected for something similar to the 81-81 record it managed last season. An attempt to land Carlos Correa on a mega-money deal also fell apart due to medical concerns.  Yankees and Mets storylines Ben Verlander sits down with Deesha Thosar to get some updates on the Yankees and Mets entering the 2023 season.   I think athletes look for every additional source of motivation and any sense that people feel that this was a player we needed and we can't win without him just creates extra motivation,  Giants president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi told reporters.  San Francisco is trying to catch up to the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won 111 games last year, and the huge-spending Padres, who beat L.A. in the postseason.  Judge, meanwhile, has no shortage of motivation of his own. He is, in a strange kind of sense, being doubted. Rare is the observer who thinks he'll flirt with 60 home runs again. Because rare is it that a player follows that sort of historic campaign with another booming season.  Time will tell if his relentless slugging can sustain the same levels he reached in 2022.  Pressure exists for the Yankees. It has been a bright and breezy spring, with much anticipation surrounding the elevation of rookie shortstop Anthony Volpe to the starting lineup, a feel-good story that hasn't entirely obscured pressing realities.  [Anthony Volpe is the Yankees' future. He was built by his Team USA past]  Manager Aaron Boone isn't necessarily looking over his shoulder after last season's 4-0 flameout to the Houston Astros in the ALCS, but being in pinstripes confers its own level of requirement, from ownership and fan base combined.  Judge understands how it works and is a fan of Boone, liking the skipper's spirit and occasionally angered edge.   Not too many managers in this game have multiple 100-win seasons and done what he's done the last couple of years,  Judge said recently.  You just look at how he talks about this team, how his players react to him. He fights for us on a daily basis, and he's in our corner through and through.   It's time for a fight again. Fourteen years have passed since the Yankees have appeared in a World Series and the locals are getting restless. Last year promised much before descending into an odd limbo, with a spectacular start followed by a 35-35 end to the year that was overshadowed by Judge's chase down of Roger Maris.  As always, Opening Day is a special time of the year, more hectic than ever in 2023 with everyone involved -- the first occasion since 1968 that each team will participate on day one.  Eyes on everyone, then, but on no one more than Judge, who knows there is more to do, and somehow, still something to prove.

Sacramento's win also ends the longest playoff drought in the four major North American sports leagues, as the Kings hadn't been to the playoffs since the 2005-06 season.  While it has been a long time since the Kings have been to the playoffs, they didn't own the most-extended drought for long. The Seattle Mariners previously held that record until they reached the playoffs in 2022, marking the first time they reached the postseason since 2001.  Seattle won its wild-card series before getting swept by the Houston Astros in the American League Divisional Series. The Kings are hoping to avoid a similar fate, as they'll likely hold home-court advantage in their first-round series.  With that said, here are the updated 12 active longest postseason droughts between the NFL , NBA , MLB and NHL .  1. New York Jets -- 12 seasons (last appearance in 2010)  A pair of New York fan bases have experienced misery over the last decade. The Jets haven't made the playoffs since Mark Sanchez was playing quarterback and Rex Ryan was at the helm in 2010, when they upset the Patriots in the divisional round and appeared in a second straight AFC title game.  ADVERTISEMENT  The Jets slowly eroded from there, seemingly bottoming out in 2020 with a 2-14 mark. Following a 7-10 season in 2022, the Jets' current playoff drought became the longest in franchise history as they previously missed the playoffs in every season between 1970-80.  Hope could be on the way for Gang Green, though, as Aaron Rodgers has stated his intention to play for the Jets in 2023.  2. Buffalo Sabres -- 11 seasons (last appearance in 2010-11)  The Sabres have mostly finished in last place or close to last in their division since 2011. Buffalo drafted Jack Eichel with the No. 2 overall pick four seasons into its drought and traded the young star in 2022. The Sabres' playoff drought is the longest in NHL history and will likely move to 12 seasons in a couple of weeks, as they'll need a lot of help to get into the 2023 postseason.  T-3. Detroit Tigers -- Eight seasons (last appearance in 2014)  The Tigers haven't made the playoffs since they had Max Scherzer and Justin Verlander in their starting rotation. They've only had one winning season in that stretch and had a dreadful 47-114 campaign in 2019.  T-3. Los Angeles Angels -- Eight seasons (last appearance in 2014)  The epic Shohei Ohtani - Mike Trout battle in the World Baseball Classic title game was the only time fans have seen the two stars play in a high-stakes game. Trout has played in just three playoff games in his career, and the Angels haven't made it to the playoffs since Ohtani joined the team in 2018.  T-5. Kansas City Royals -- Seven seasons (last appearance in 2015)  The Royals reached baseball's mountaintop in 2015, winning the World Series a year after they lost in seven games on baseball's grandest stage. Kansas City held one of the worst records in baseball in 2022.  T-5. Pittsburgh Pirates -- Seven seasons (last appearance in 2015)  The Pirates earned three playoff appearances in a row (2013-15), but they haven't recovered since the Cubs beat them in the 2015 NL wild-card round.  T-5. Charlotte Hornets -- Seven seasons (last appearance in 2015-16)  The Hornets nearly squeaked into the playoffs in 2022. They made the Play-In Tournament but were blown out in the opening game. Many thought LaMelo Ball would continue his rise and help Charlotte reach the playoffs in 2023, but injuries plagued his season, and they're instead chasing the No. 1 overall pick.  T-5. Denver Broncos -- Seven seasons (last appearance in 2015)  The Broncos haven't made the playoffs since their triumphant Super Bowl win to cap off the 2015 campaign. That, of course, was Peyton Manning's final game. Denver recently traded for quarterback Russell Wilson in hopes of solving its chronic quarterback problem, but it didn't do much to fix it. The Broncos hired Super Bowl-winning head coach Sean Payton during the offseason believing that he's the missing ingredient for them to reach the playoffs.  T-9. Texas Rangers -- Six seasons (last appearance in 2016)  The Rangers were a postseason mainstay last decade, clinching a berth five times in seven seasons between 2010-16. But even after signing Corey Seager and Marcus Semien to big contracts, they still finished toward the bottom of the league in 2022. They spent their 2023 offseason money on pitching, adding Jacob deGrom, Nathan Eovaldi and Andrew Heaney.  T-9. Baltimore Orioles -- Six seasons (last appearance in 2016)  The Orioles hit the reset button not long after their last playoff appearance in 2016, leading to some really poor seasons in 2018 (47 wins), 2019 (54 wins) and 2021 (52 wins).  Things might be changing in Baltimore, though, as it has one of the game's most exciting young group of players. The Orioles also went 83-79 in a loaded AL East in 2022.  T-9. Detroit Red Wings -- Six seasons (last appearance in 2015-16)  Longtime fans of the Red Wings haven't been too accustomed to the team's recent stretch. The franchise had a 25-year playoff streak prior to its current drought. The Red Wings' streak will likely continue in 2023, as they'll need to make up a lot of ground in the homestretch if they hope to make the playoffs.  T-9. Detroit Lions -- Six seasons (last appearance in 2016)  Detroit fans haven't had a lot of success to cheer about in recent seasons, but the Lions at least seem to be on the come-up. They were just a game away from making the playoffs in 2022, finishing 9-8 as a Seattle Seahawks loss in the final week of the season would've sent them into the postseason.  share"}, {"source": "google-news-is", "title": "mpgynym b`d hrpvrmh hmSHpTyt Hsmv At ntyby Ayylvn - glvbs", "text": "Alpy tvmKHy hmhpKHh hmSHpTyt hpgynv h`rb btl Abyb b`kbvt hSHhyyt hlyKH hHkykh.  hmpgynym, SHhgy`v mrHby hArTS, htAspv brHbt mvzyAvn tl Abyb brHvb SHAvl hmlKH.

Aaron Judge opened the new season by doing what he did a lot last year. His Opening Day home run propelled the Yankees to a win over the Giants.  Elsewhere, the Astros' Opening Day winning streak was snapped at 10 with the White Sox pulling through in the ninth to beat the defending champs. Adley Rutschman had a five-hit day to lift the Orioles over the Red Sox, 10-9. George Springer also had a five-hit day to give the Blue Jays a 10-9 win over the Cardinals.  In National League action, the Dodgers looked a lot like they did in 2022, defeating Diamondbacks 8-2. The first game of the Padres' new loaded lineup didn't go the way they would've liked as they lost to the Rockies 7-2.  Finally, Shohei Ohtani did his thing on the mound and pitched six scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts. But the Angels gave up two runs in the eighth to lose to the Athletics, 2-1.  Here are the top plays from Opening Day!  FINAL: Colorado Rockies 7, San Diego Padres 2  ADVERTISEMENT  X-man delivers in first Padres at-bat  After Manny Machado hit a game-tying sacrifice fly, Xander Bogaerts reached base in his first at-bat with the Padres by hitting a double.  Cron crushes it  C.J. Cron hit a three-run shot in the fifth to give the Rockies a 4-2 lead as all of Colorado first four runs were knocked in by the first baseman.  Back-to-back jacks  Cron went yard a second time in Thursday's game in the seventh inning. This time, Elehuris Montero followed up with a home run of his own to give the Rockies a 7-2 lead in the seventh.  FINAL: Oakland Athletics 2, Los Angeles Angels 1  Catching Trout  Esteury Ruiz made a diving grab in the first inning to make sure Mike Trout didn't get on base in his first at-bat of the season.  Ohtani got the heat  Shohei Ohtani pitched a 101 mph heater past Ramon Laureano for the strikeout to give him seven Ks in the first four innings.  Hunting for an unbelievable catch  Hunter Renfroe made a behind-the-back, no-look grab to prevent an extra-base hit that had Ohtani in amazement.  Tony time  Tony Kemp hit an RBI double in the eighth to help the A's score their first run of the game and tie it up. Later, Aledmys Diaz knocked Kemp in on a base hit to left to give Oakland a 2-1 lead.  FINAL: Seattle Mariners 3, Cleveland Guardians 0  Ty unties it!

FINAL: Chicago White Sox 3, Houston Astros 1  Styled out for the ceremony  The Astros wore jerseys with gold numbers and their owner entered the field on a horse-drawn carriage with their two World Series trophies.  Unveil the banner!  The Astros' banner unveiling went smoothly and the fans mocked fans of the teams they faced in the playoffs last year.  A 'Savage' first pitch  Award-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion opened the baseball season in Houston in a funny way when she threw out the first pitch.  Wild time!  Yordan Alvarez scored on a wide pitch to break the scoreless tie and give the Astros the lead in the seventh.  Having a Grand-al time  Yasmani Grandal sent the pitch into the right field bleachers to even the game up at 1-1 in the eighth.  Vaughn turned it on in the clutch  Andrew Vaughn knocked in two runs with his double in the ninth to give the White Sox a 3-1 lead before winning 3-2 to end the Astros' Opening Day winning streak.  FINAL: New York Yankees 5, San Francisco Giants 0  $360 million homer  Aaron Judge's first at-bat as captain of the New York Yankees was a solo home run to center in the bottom of the first.

FINAL: Tampa Bay Rays 4, Detroit Tigers 0  A screamer  Jose Siri drew first blood for the Tampa Bay Rays in the bottom of the third with a line-drive solo homer to left.  What a grab  Manuel Margot made a diving grab in right, potentially keeping two runs off the board in the seventh.

O anuncio foi feito em coletiva de imprensa realizada na sede do Ministerio da Fazenda, em Brasilia. Tambem participaram do evento Gabriel Galipolo, secretario-executivo da pasta; Rogerio Ceron, secretario do Tesouro Nacional; e Guilherme Mello, secretario de Politica Economica. Assista a um trecho pelo video acima.  O novo marco fiscal estabelece meta de trajetoria de resultado primario para o governo federal ate 2026, com banda de variacao toleravel, crescimento de despesas sempre abaixo das receitas em momentos de crescimento e mecanismos anticiclicos que garantem elevacao de gastos em situacoes de crise.  Segundo Haddad, a nova regra buscou compatibilizar boas praticas previstas na Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (LRF) com aspectos positivos de uma regra de limitacao de despesas.   Do ponto de vista das contas publicas, entendemos que precisamos recuperar uma trajetoria de credibilidade. Por isso, associamos o melhor dos dois mundos: tracar uma trajetoria consistente de resultado primario, em que necessariamente a despesa vai correr atras da receita - e, portanto, ampliar o espaco de economia para dar sustentabilidade as contas publicas -, mas sem uma rigidez absoluta, porque as demandas sociais estao ai para serem atendidas , afirmou.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Para 2023, o centro da meta de resultado primario esta em um deficit de 0,5% do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), podendo variar de um deficit de 0,25% a um deficit de 0,75%. No ano seguinte, a meta central e de equilibrio entre receitas e despesas, podendo variar de um deficit de 0,25% para um superavit de 0,25%.  O ano de 2025 e o primeiro em que a meta e as bandas sinalizam superavit primario, variando de 0,25% a 0,75%, com meta em 0,50% do PIB. Ja em 2026, o ultimo ano do governo Lula, o centro da meta fica em 1% do PIB de superavit, com a mesma tolerancia de 0,25 ponto percentual para cima ou para baixo.  Segundo Haddad, as metas de resultado primario tem uma banda de tolerancia para evitar gastos sem planejamento ou cortes atabalhoados por parte de orgaos publicos ao final de cada exercicio.  De acordo com as projecoes da equipe tecnica do Ministerio da Fazenda, considerando um cenario de atingimento do centro da meta de resultado primario nestes quatro anos, a Divida Bruta do Governo Geral (DBGG) deve sair de 75,11% do PIB em 2023 para 76,54% em 2026.  Ja na hipotese mais pessimista, de atingimento do limite inferior da banda de resultado primario, o exercicio aponta para a DBGG em 77,34% do PIB no ultimo ano de governo.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Caso haja um fechamento na abertura de mais de 1 ponto percentual na curva de juros a termo (observada em razao de incertezas com a politica fiscal nos ultimos meses), a equipe economica projeta que seria possivel levar a divida bruta a 75,05% do PIB, no cenario base, em 2026, e a 75,83% em hipotese pessimista na banda inferior da meta para o mesmo periodo.  O projeto de lei complementar, que sera encaminhado para analise do parlamento na semana que vem, deve conter, ainda, dispositivo que faz com que, em periodos de crescimento economico, as despesas publicas nao crescam na mesma proporcao que as receitas.  Pela regra, o crescimento de despesas ficaria limitado a 70% da variacao da receita primaria em um periodo de 12 meses, respeitando um teto de 2,5% reais para esse aumento.  Na pratica, seria uma trava para as despesas, porem mais branda do que hoje estabelece o teto de gastos - regra fortemente atacada por Lula e aliados, que limita o crescimento de gastos em um ano ao comportamento da inflacao no exercicio anterior.  Ja em casos de retracao, o novo marco fiscal estabelece um incremento de 0,6% para as despesas no exercicio. O instrumento garante que nao seja necessario corte de despesas em momentos de crise economica, em que muitos economistas defendem a adocao de estimulos para a atividade.  Isso significa que, desconsiderando excepcionalidades constitucionais, o atual teto de gastos passaria a ter uma banda com crescimento real da despesa primaria entre 0,6% a 2,5% ao ano.  O percentual minimo leva em conta a media de crescimento populacional, de modo assegurar que a despesa publica por cidadao nao caia ao longo dos anos. Enquanto o maximo e uma referencia do que a equipe economica acredita ser um bom patamar de aumento do PIB, de modo a nao permitir um crescimento excessivo do Estado em momentos de  boom .   Para evitar ficar naquela situacao em que voce tem uma regra e as excepcionalidades, resolvemos trazer para dentro da regra aquilo que e uma especie de crescimento vegetativo em funcao do que se verificou desde a promulgacao do teto de gastos , explicou o ministro.   Se houver um boom de commodities por causa da reabertura da China ou, por conta das medidas que serao tomadas ate o final do ano, houver um incremento de 5% da receita de um ano para o outro, havera uma limitacao. Por que ela e importante? Porque e o colchao que precisamos para a fase ruim. Por isso que se chama anticiclico. Faz-se um colchao na fase boa para poder usa-lo na fase ruim, e nao deixar que o Estado se desorganize, sobretudo quando esta envolvido o direito do cidadao a aqueles servicos constitucionalmente estabelecidos , defendeu.  Assim como funcionava no teto de gastos antes de a mudanca implementada pela PEC dos Precatorios, o periodo utilizado para avaliacao das receitas na metodologia (e como parametro para a definicao das despesas) e de 12 meses encerrados em junho do ano anterior ao exercicio em discussao.  Isso permite que as projecoes ja sejam incorporadas no Projeto de Lei Orcamentaria Anual (PLOA), que o governo precisa encaminhar todo ano ao Congresso Nacional ate agosto, e evita superestimacao de receitas para elevar artificialmente o espaco para despesas.  O texto tambem tem mecanismo que permite, em caso de resultado superior a banda prevista na meta, o excedente seja utilizado em investimentos publicos. Ja se o resultado alcancado ficar abaixo do minimo estabelecido, o governo fica obrigado a reduzir o crescimento de despesas para 50%, e nao mais 70%, do incremento de receitas no exercicio seguinte ate que o resultado primario retorne ao intervalo desejavel.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Os investimentos publicos terao, pela nova regra, um piso estabelecido com base no volume de investimentos previsto na Lei Orcamentaria Anual (LOA) de 2023, corrigida pela inflacao. Uma das principais criticas atribuidas ao teto de gastos era que a necessidade de cumprimento da regra teria sacrificado tal rubrica em detrimento a um aumento real e constante de despesas obrigatorias.  As expectativas da equipe economica sao de que o nivel de investimentos em relacao a receita primaria apresente um crescimento continuo nos proximos dois ciclos de governo, saindo de 2,2% em 2022 para 4,2% em 2030 com a nova regra.  Alem disso, o piso da enfermagem e o Fundo de Manutencao e Desenvolvimento da Educacao Basica e de Valorizacao dos Profissionais da Educacao (Fundeb) ficarao fora da regra de controle de despesas - excepcionalidades ja previstas na Constituicao Federal.  O novo arcabouco tambem preve que os minimos constitucionais para Saude e Educacao, de 15% e 18% da receita liquida, respectivamente, sejam restabelecidos a partir do proximo ano e tenham crescimento real nos exercicios subsequentes. Neste caso, a regra ainda esta em discussao no governo. Mas os dois casos sao considerados no total de despesas sujeitas as limitacoes impostas pelo marco fiscal.  Ao final de sua exposicao, Haddad disse que o trabalho  nao termina hoje , apenas  comeca . Em uma defesa contra preocupacoes externadas no campo da esquerda as consequencias do novo arcabouco fiscal para o funcionamento do Estado brasileiro, o ministro enfatizou que o instrumento  nao vai ser impedimento que se cumpra com aquilo que foi convencionado pela sociedade .   Apenas que o que foi convencionado tem que ter a contrapartida dos setores mais abastados sobre a sustentabilidade do que foi proposto , explicou.   Essa regra nos permite olhar para cada familia desse pais e dizer que nao vamos admitir que um dos maiores produtores de alimento do mundo conviva com a fome nunca mais. E nao vemos nenhuma razao, a partir deste anuncio, para alguem ter duvidas sobre investir no Brasil , declarou.  Na apresentacao, Haddad assegurou que a equipe economica atualmente nao considera elevar a carga tributaria para alcancar o equilibrio desejado para as contas publicas.  Se por carga tributaria se entende criacao de novos tributos ou aumento de aliquota dos tributos existentes, a resposta e: nao esta no nosso horizonte. Nao estamos pensando em CPMF, nao estamos pensando em acabar com o Simples [Nacional], nao estamos pensando em reonerar a folha de pagamento. Nao e disso que se trata , frisou.  O ministro informou que, junto com o novo arcabouco fiscal, o governo encaminhara novas  medidas saneadoras  das contas publicas, que devem trazer um incremento estimado entre R$ 100 e 150 bilhoes aos cofres publicos, em um esforco que classificou como  agenda contra o patrimonialismo .   Temos que fazer quem nao paga imposto pagar. E temos muito setores que estao demasiadamente favorecidos com regras que foram sendo estabelecidas ao longo das decadas e que nao foram revistas por nenhum controle de resultado. Muitas caducaram, do ponto de vista de eficiencia, precisam ser revogadas , afirmou.   Vamos encaminhar ao parlamento as medidas saneadoras que vao dar consistencia para o resultado previsto nesse anuncio , continuou. Sem entrar em muitos detalhes, o ministro falou em beneficios indevidos, fraudes e cobrar de setores novos nao regulamentados e citou as 'big techs'.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   Isso nao vai penalizar absolutamente ninguem que esta com seus tributos em dia , disse.  Se quem nao paga imposto passar a pagar, todos nos vamos pagar menos juros. Para isso acontecer, aquele que esta fora do sistema tem que vir para o sistema. O Congresso Nacional tem que ter sensibilidade para perceber quanto seu desejo foi aviltado na pratica pelos abusos e corrigir essas distorcoes .  A necessidade de o governo apresentar uma nova regra fiscal esta prevista na Emenda Constitucional da Transicao, que abriu espaco no Orcamento as margens do teto de gastos para a execucao do novo Bolsa Familia e de outras promessas de campanha de Lula.  A peca estabelece a data de 31 de agosto como prazo limite para o governo encaminhar ao Congresso Nacional um novo marco fiscal na forma de um projeto de lei complementar. Caso isso nao fosse cumprido, o teto de gastos seguiria como ancora para as contas publicas do pais.  Em uma sinalizacao aos agentes economicos, Haddad antecipou o calendario para marco. A decisao tambem atendeu a pedido de Tebet, para que o Projeto de Lei de Diretrizes Orcamentarias (PLDO) pudesse ser enviada ao Poder Legislativo, ate 15 de abril, ja incorporando aspectos da nova regra.  O martelo da nova regra fiscal foi batido ontem (29), apos reuniao com Lula no Palacio da Alvorada. Participaram do encontro a ministra da Gestao e da Inovacao em Servicos Publicos Esther Dweck, a secretaria-executiva da Casa Civil, Miriam Belchior, a presidente nacional do PT, deputada Gleisi Hoffmann (PR); os secretarios Galipolo, Ceron e Guilherme Mello e os lideres do governo no Senado Federal, Jaques Wagner (PT-BA), e na Camara dos Deputados, Jose Guimaraes (PT-CE).  Antes do anuncio dos detalhes para o publico, Haddad visitou os presidentes da Camara dos Deputados, Arthur Lira (PP-AL), e do Senado Federal, Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD-MG), para compartilhar o texto com liderancas partidarias das duas casas legislativas.  Durante a coletiva de imprensa, a ministra Simone Tebet foi enfatica ao dizer que a nova regra fiscal e crivel por ser flexivel, permitindo a acomodacao de demandas por politicas publicas com a necessidade de dar previsibilidade aos gastos publicos e a dinamica da divida federal.   Sob a otica do Ministerio do Planejamento e Orcamento, estamos absolutamente tranquilos e convictos que, se for da vontade do Congresso Nacional, em aprovando esse arcabouco fiscal, nos conseguiremos a meta, que e diminuir as despesas dentro do possivel - mas nao e o foco principal; o foco principal e ter qualidade do gasto publico, ter receita suficiente para garantir minimamente aquilo que consideramos essencial em politicas publicas , disse."}, {"source": "google-news-sa", "title": "bthm@ ltjss.. rwsy t`tql mrsl  wwl stryt jwrnl  - l`rby@", "text": "b`dm '`ln 'kbr jhz 'mny rwsy `tql mrsl SHyf@  wwl stryt jwrnl  bthm@ ltjss, `bWrt lSHyf@ `n qlqh lblG mm yjry.  w'kdt lSHyf@ fy byn lkhmys, 'n `ln jhz l'mn lfydrly, whw '`l~ wkl@ ll'mn ldkhly wmkfH@ ltjss, `tql yfn Gyrshkwfytsh fy mdyn@ yktrynbrG bjbl l'wrl, 'mr Gryb.  md@ `lny@  wkshft `n qlqh lblG mn t`ml lslTt lrwsy@ m` lSHfyyn.  km nft bshd@ thmt mwskw lmrslh bltjss, mTlb@ blfrj lfwry `nh.

We're just one sleep away from Opening Day baseball. This time of year is full of sky-high expectations, but there are ultimately lots of unknowns. So much has to go right for all 30 clubs to reach their goals.  Let's take a look at one burning question for each MLB team heading into the new season.  AL EAST  New York Yankees: Can Anthony Volpe flourish in his rookie season as starting shortstop?  The 21-year-old kid from New Jersey who grew up playing baseball with his dad in Manhattan has already forced himself onto the Yankees' big-league roster; now he will try to hold onto that starting shortstop role for the long haul. Volpe will undoubtedly go through slips and surges in his rookie season, and the focus will be on how he responds to those moments of adversity. If Volpe can shrug off an 0-for-4 day at the plate and rebound quickly while staying consistently solid on the dirt, the Yankees will have little to worry about with their potential franchise shortstop.  Boston Red Sox: Can Chris Sale stay healthy for a full season?  For the first time since 2019, Sale is breaking camp instead of staying idle on the injured list. After enjoying seven straight All-Star seasons from 2012-2018, Sale has a lot to prove this year -- mainly regarding his health. The veteran southpaw was limited to just 48.1 innings pitched across the past two seasons due to injuries. Boston's path to contention relies heavily on Sale taking the mound every fifth day and, of course, pitching effectively. He's slated to start the second game of the season against the Orioles on Saturday at Fenway.  ADVERTISEMENT  Red Sox season preview: Will Rafael Devers contend for an MVP?  Baltimore Orioles: Can their young stars carry them to contention and will the front office supplement that talent?  The front office made it clear this winter, when top brass made few outside additions, that the organization will rely on its young stars to build off last year's 83-win season. That's a lot of pressure for guys like Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, Ryan Mountcastle and Kyle Stowers. If the Orioles are an AL wild-card contender, they will also need support from the front office at the trade deadline to push the team over the edge. Baltimore has an outrageous depth of upper level hitting prospects that it could trade for an immediate impact arm to help supplement that talent from its young roster.  Toronto Blue Jays: Can the new-look club stay consistent enough to grab the division title?  The Blue Jays have had their eyes on the AL East title for a few years, but they haven't been able to grab it since 2015. This year, Toronto goes into the season with a far more balanced roster in hopes of making that leap, but it will largely rely on a strong starting rotation to potentially collect more wins than the division-favorite Yankees. Alek Manoah, Kevin Gausman, Chris Bassitt, Jose Berrios and Yusei Kikuchi will attempt to do the heavy lifting.  Tampa Bay Rays: Can they carry their regular-season momentum into a long postseason run?  The Rays went out with a whimper last October, falling to the Cleveland Guardians in the AL wild-card series with an offense that became invisible down the stretch. The key for the Rays -- a solid team that is equipped with desired depth and a manager in Kevin Cash who knows how to use the strengths of his roster -- will be to stay healthy and save their best offensive moments for the playoffs. Tampa Bay has reached the postseason four years in a row and, with largely the same squad as last season, there's little reason to believe it won't contend again. But the bats will need to show up this time.  AL CENTRAL  Minnesota Twins: Can Carlos Correa silence lingering questions about his ankle?  The Twins will look to close the gap with the Guardians with Correa and Byron Buxton as key lineup pieces. This, of course, is in the aftermath of a wacky offseason that saw Correa agree to (much) bigger contracts with both the Giants and the Mets, only for each to fall through because of failed physicals. Any sign of injury from Correa will immediately trigger red flags about his ankle; more importantly, he must stay healthy for the Twins to have a shot at contention. If the Guardians' success last year was a fluke, Correa and Minnesota will have a path to claiming the division title.  Cleveland Guardians: Can Josh Bell be the answer for their lack of power?  The pesky Guardians surprised us all last year by winning 92 games and a division title before eventually pushing the Yankees to fives games in the ALDS. While their small-ball and contact-approach offense brought on impressive results, everyone not named Jose Ramirez struggled with power. Enter Bell, whom Cleveland acquired this offseason to help boost its slugging numbers and provide Ramirez with some much-needed protection. Cleveland's offense should be in good shape if Bell can repeat, or even come close to, his 37-homer season for the 2019 Pirates.  Guardians season preview: Can they repeat last year's success?  Kansas City Royals: Can the pitching staff take a positive step forward under different coaches?  New pitching coach Brian Sweeney, who joined from Cleveland, will look to overhaul Kansas City's lackluster pitching staff in hopes of setting up solid arms for the future. Sweeney will work with first-time manager Matt Quatraro to reverse the club's lousy 2022 numbers. The Royals had the league's third-worst strikeouts-per-nine-innings (7.57) ratio last year and second-worst walks per nine (3.74).  Detroit Tigers: Can they be better than last year?  Yes, it's a low bar. But after Detroit's 96 losses in 2022, also known as A.J. Hinch's worst career record as manager, we need to see better baseball all-around from the Tigers this year. The Tigers made no significant splashes on the trade or free-agency market this winter, so new president of baseball operations Scott Harris can see what he is dealing with internally before making any moves down the line. Look for bounce-back seasons from Javier Baez and Jonathan Schoop, for starters.  Chicago White Sox: Does Lucas Giolito spend his entire year in Chicago?  Giolito will become a free agent following the 2023 season and the White Sox have eyes on the World Series, but the club should know by midsummer whether it will fall short or approach that goal. If Giolito bounces back from his 4.90 ERA season and pitches effectively and Chicago is still struggling to put up wins, the right-hander could be on the trading block heading into the July 31 deadline. It will be interesting to see how his season shakes out and how much that will impact the Sox's expectations.  AL WEST:  Houston Astros: Can Jose Abreu hit the ground running?  The Astros' latest offensive addition almost negates the fact that they let ace Justin Verlander walk away to the Mets in free agency. Abreu's presence in Houston's lineup will only make the defending champions more of a threat, as bizarre as that may be to believe. But with Jose Altuve out several weeks to start the season, the pressure will be on a 36-year-old Abreu to demonstrate the power he'd always displayed with the White Sox prior to 2022. The Astros made it clear with their championship run that they are looking to solidify a dynasty, and for the most part they have the pieces and depth in place to do it.  Los Angeles Angels: Is this Shohei Ohtani's final season in Anaheim?  We're all thinking it, and it will be on our minds for the majority of the season as the two-way star enters his walk year. Ohtani has made it clear he wants to win, but it's becoming increasingly unlikely that he'll do so with the MLB team he chose upon leaving Japan. The Angels did add some infield depth pieces to supplement the talent of Ohtani and Mike Trout, but it will take a healthy and above-average year from the entire roster to have any shot at contention.  Angels season preview: Will Shohei Ohtani make the playoffs?  Oakland Athletics: Can the inexperienced offense rebound from last year's results?  Coming off a 102-loss season, the focus continues to be on the A's young talent and how well that group adjusts to the big leagues. Oakland added some veterans to the lineup -- Jesus Aguilar, Aledmys Diaz and Jace Peterson -- to help offset the overall youth of the offense, which should certainly help. But last season's results were ugly. The A's finished last year with baseball's worst slugging percentage (.346), on-base percentage (.281) and batting average (.216), as the organization continued its rebuild.  Texas Rangers: Can Jacob deGrom have a Cy Young season?  The change of scenery should work wonders on deGrom after he walked away from the Mets and joined the Rangers on a five-year, $185 million contract. It's actually bold to predict that deGrom won't miss a single start in 2023 after his red-flag arm injuries these past few years. But when he has been able to stay on the mound, he's been the best pitcher in baseball. If he can curb his maladies, both minor and major, there's no reason to believe deGrom won't be in the Cy Young conversation come September.  Seattle Mariners: Will this be the year Jarred Kelenic breaks out?  Having a hot Kelenic bat would do wonders for a Mariners lineup led by Julio Rodriguez and backed by new additions Kolten Wong and Teoscar Hernandez. Kelenic has a 66 OPS+ across 558 major-league plate appearances over these past couple of years. But FanGraphs predicts that Kelenic will record a 105 wRC+ and above-average production. The former first-round draft pick has so much to prove, and this could finally be the year that he makes that jump.  NL EAST  New York Mets: Can they overcome the huge loss of Edwin Diaz?  It's no small thing to replace the pitcher who had the highest putaway percentage on a single pitch type (Diaz's slider, 38.4%) in the majors last year. Diaz was also the reason the Mets boasted the best strikeouts-per-nine ratio (9.79) in MLB. But replace, they must. Diaz is expected to be out for the entirety of the 2023 season and the Mets' next-best option is veteran reliever David Robertson, who also has experience closing games for the Yankees in a post-Mariano Rivera world. Robertson, 37, must stay healthy and effective, but either way our eyes will be on the Mets' ninth innings in high-leverage situations.  Atlanta Braves: Can they replicate a 101-win season without Dansby Swanson?  Letting Swanson walk to the Cubs rather than signing him long term remains a head-scratcher as Atlanta opens the 2023 season. That decision became even more puzzling when the expected shortstop replacement, rookie Vaughn Grissom, was optioned to Triple-A this spring. The Braves will roll with Orlando Arcia at short and hope for monster seasons from Ronald Acuna Jr., Austin Riley, Ozzie Albies and others to remain in the three-dog fight for the NL East title.  Philadelphia Phillies: Can Trea Turner stabilize the offense while Bryce Harper heals?  Harper underwent Tommy John surgery after the World Series and is not expected back in the lineup until the second half of the Phillies' season. Until then, newest addition Turner will look to carry his five-homer World Baseball Classic momentum to the regular season this week. The Phillies will try to defend the NL championship without the injured Rhys Hoskins and with a stacked offense that is bound to build off last year's postseason run. The on-paper talent is obvious, but the Phillies will need to stay healthy to achieve it.  Phillies season preview: Will the lineup get them back to the World Series?  Washington Nationals: Can CJ Abrams show flashes of being a franchise shortstop?  Abrams will enter his first full season with the Nats in 2023 and there's a lot riding on his performance. In Washington as part of the trade that sent Juan Soto to the Padres, Abrams has already turned heads with his leather in his 44-game stint with the Nats last season. The 22-year-old's combination of speed and bat-to-ball skills has the Nats excited about his dynamic presence in the lineup and on the diamond.  Miami Marlins: In a stacked division, can the young rotation shut down opposing offenses?  The still win-now Marlins rely on their pitching, and there's no better arm to carry the club than reigning NL Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara. If the rest of the young starters can pick Alcantara's brain and replicate some of his talent, the Marlins rotation could be trouble for the rest of the division. Miami still needs a significant boost from the offense, which a healthy Jazz Chisholm should provide, but the pitching staff will be the part of its roster that shines.  NL CENTRAL:  Cincinnati Reds: Can they see signs of hope in another rebuilding year?  The Reds were one of four teams that finished 2022 with 100 or more losses, and they will look to progress from that painful number this year. Another distressing number was the amount of players they used: a team-record 66. Due to injuries, the Reds exposed their lack of major-league-ready talent and depth in a lost season that was evident from the get-go. Cincinnati will hope for a better start than its 3-22 opening record while relying on possible bounce-back seasons from guys like Jonathan India and Alexis Diaz.  Milwaukee Brewers: Is this the year for a Christian Yelich comeback?  Yelich could be Milwaukee's X-factor this year after recent dips in production from the MVP-caliber outfielder. The Brewers missed the playoffs by only one game last year -- their first postseason absence since 2017 -- and they're eager to make it back to October baseball again with their core intact. Yelich, at 31 years old, could be the difference for them this year, no matter how unfair it is that we'll always compare his run production to his incredible 2018 and '19 seasons.  St. Louis Cardinals: Will the rotation hold up over the long season?  The Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldscmidt-led Cardinals are automatic World Series contenders, but it's their starting rotation that could derail those plans. Adam Wainwright, sidelined with a groin injury to open the season, plans to coach the other arms, particularly lefties Steven Matz and Jordan Montgomery, in hopes of keeping that rotation on track. But Jack Flaherty and Miles Mikolas need to deliver more ace promise than potential.  Cardinals season preview: Can the new wave Cardinals win a division title?  Pittsburgh Pirates: Will Bryan Reynolds remain a Pirate long term?  The Pirates are reportedly trying to sign Reynolds to a long-term deal that he believes is fair, months after it was made public that the outfielder wanted to be traded. Now, it seems Reynolds has shifted his tune and wants to sign an extension before Opening Day. If not, the focus will be on Reynolds throughout the year and how much he could help a contender seeking an outfielder with a career 127 OPS+ come the trade deadline.  Chicago Cubs: Can the offseason additions put them over the edge?  A trio of World Series winners in Cody Bellinger, Dansby Swanson and Trey Mancini joined the Cubs this winter. Chicago hopes that experience and leadership will blend nicely with their young hitters like 2022 breakout star Nico Hoerner and right fielder Seiya Suzuki, who has yet to realize his potential. The Cubs believe their 2023 roster is built to contend, but there are a lot of what ifs with the plan they have in place, particularly offensively.  NL WEST:  Los Angeles Dodgers: No longer division favorites, can they still compete for the World Series?  The Dodgers didn't do anything significant this offseason besides add Noah Syndergaard and J.D. Martinez and watch as key contributors Trea Turner and Justin Turner found new homes. They'll continue to ride the likes of Freddie Freeman, Mookie Betts, Julio Urias, Clayton Kershaw and others. But it's possible they take a step back in run production this year with a new-look lineup. While 111 wins looks unattainable, this should still be a playoff team.  San Diego Padres: Will they finally win the division?  The Pads have not won the West since 2006, but none of their rosters looked like the one they carry into 2023. Manny Machado, Juan Soto, Xander Bogaerts and Fernando Tatis Jr. headline a loaded San Diego lineup. Yu Darvish, Joe Musgrove and Blake Snell lead the rotation. And Josh Hader, capable of being the best reliever in baseball, leads the bullpen. The 2023 Padres are scary and they have all the pieces to not only win the division but the NL pennant and, perhaps, the World Series. The first step is ensuring the Dodgers are the second-best team in the division.  Padres season preview: Can they overtake the Dodgers as king of the West?  Colorado Rockies: Can Kris Bryant stay healthy and flourish at Coors Field?  We're still waiting for Bryant to crush a Coors Field home run after injuries limited him to 42 games last year. All five of his 2022 home runs came on the road, which nobody would've predicted when he signed that puzzling seven-year, $182 million contract with Colorado. Bryant is seven years removed from his MVP season with the Cubs, but he remains the only bright star in the Rockies' unremarkable lineup.  Arizona Diamondbacks: Can the next wave of prospects make legitimate impacts in the majors?  D-backs general manager Mike Hazen is all too ready to forget about the club's last few years of constant disappointment, and he thinks this is the season their next wave of prospects start to excel at the major-league level. Keep an eye on Corbin Carroll, Alek Thomas and Jake McCarthy to provide early offensive excitement for Arizona.  San Francisco Giants: How does Michael Conforto fare after a full season sidelined?  Let's be honest, there's not much pop coming from this Giants lineup other than imports Conforto and Mitch Haniger. After failing to sign Aaron Judge and Correa this offseason, the Giants will turn to their newest additions to help stabilize the lineup. Conforto and his career 124 OPS+ will be back in the box in 2023 after missing last season due to injury. If Conforto excels in the Bay and the Giants are out of contention by July, the outfielder could become a solid trade chip at the deadline.  Deesha Thosar is an MLB writer for FOX Sports.

Baroness Doreen Lawrence is one of a number of high-profile individuals, including the Duke of Sussex, accusing the newspaper's publishers Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) of concealing  wrongdoing  over the alleged unlawful gathering of their private information.  ANL vehemently denies the claims and has argued for the case to be dismissed. A four-day preliminary hearing has now concluded, with the judge to deliver a decision on whether the case should go to trial in writing at a later date.  Image: Prince Harry made a brief appearance on Thursday  During Thursday's session, barrister David Sherborne, representing the claimant group - which also includes Sir Elton John, Liz Hurley, Sadie Frost and former Liberal Democrat MP Sir Simon Hughes - said they had a  compelling case .  It is alleged ANL commissioned 19 different private investigators to carry out a series of unlawful acts from 1993 to 2011 and beyond, which in some instances informed articles, Mr Sherborne said.  The group was  thrown off the scent by the way in which the articles were written , the court heard.  Mr Sherborne later read out extracts from Baroness Lawrence's witness statement, in which she said she felt  played for a fool  by the Daily Mail, believing the newspaper  really cared  about the injustice of the murder of her son Stephen.   They were supposed to be our allies and friends, the good people, not the bad,  she said. Baroness Lawrence said she had believed information in articles about her had come from the police.  Mr Sherborne told the court:  That is nothing short of gaslighting Baroness Lawrence, that's the form of concealment we are talking about.

Image: Sir Elton John's husband David Furnish was in court for the final day  The term gaslighting means to manipulate someone into questioning their own sanity or powers of reasoning.  Known as a campaigner and reformer, Baroness Lawrence has devoted herself to seeking justice for her 18-year-old son, an aspiring architect who was murdered in an unprovoked racist attack in southeast London in 1993.  The Daily Mail, under then editor Paul Dacre, campaigned to bring Mr Lawrence's killers to justice, running a front page in 1997 that saw the newspaper brand five suspects  Murderers  - challenging them to sue if the headline was incorrect.  Baroness Lawrence was present in court for part of Thursday's session, as were Harry and Sir Elton's husband David Furnish, following appearances earlier in the week from Sir Elton and Frost.  Trial could be 'substantial' if it does go ahead  Adrian Beltrami KC, representing the publisher, previously told the court that all the claims  are rejected by the defendant in their entirety as are the unfounded allegations that are repeatedly made that the defendant either misled the Leveson Inquiry or concealed evidence from the Leveson Inquiry .  The lawyer said the legal action against ANL has  no real prospects of succeeding  and is  barred  under a legal period of limitation.  After hearing the final arguments in the preliminary hearing, Mr Justice Nicklin told the court he would hand down his judgment on whether the case should go to trial as soon as he can.  He indicated earlier in the session that if the case does go to trial, it could be one that lasts for a  substantial period of time .  Read more:  Prince Harry v Associated Newspapers: All you need to know  Harry's children officially recognised as prince and princess  After hearing Baroness Lawrence's claims during the first day of the preliminary hearing, an ANL spokesperson said:  While the Mail's admiration for Baroness Lawrence remains undimmed, we are profoundly saddened that she has been persuaded to bring this case.   The Mail remains hugely proud of its pivotal role in campaigning for justice for Stephen Lawrence. Its famous  Murderers  front page triggered the Macpherson report [an inquiry into Mr Lawrence's death].   Associated Newspapers, which owns the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday, vigorously denies all the claims against it. "}, {"source": "google-news-sa", "title": "fy lfD..

The monarch's speech was the first given to Germany's federal parliament by a non-elected head of state. It was pitched as a celebration of cultural commonalities and joint ventures past and present - from a shared love of music and comedy to energy and security cooperation - and an attempt to repair ties that have fractured since the Brexit vote seven years ago.   Great Britain and Germany are, and will remain, close allies and trusting partners, even after the decision to leave the European Union,  said the Bundestag's president, Barbel Bas, in her introduction, but Charles did not pick up the baton. In his 25-minute speech, he declined to mention Brexit or the EU.  Instead, the king thanked the German people for their condolences on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who he said had  held a special place in German hearts , and he spoke of the role she played in the reconciliation process that brought the two countries together after the second world war.  In a stopgap history that covered the Hanseatic League, Shakespeare, football rivalries, Kraftwerk and the Beatles, the king also highlighted Anglo-German leadership on offshore wind power production and material and financial support for Ukraine's defensive war against Russia.   Germany's decision to give Ukraine such great military support is considerably brave, important and welcome,  Charles said.  Switching repeatedly between his English tongue and the German language spoken fluently by his late father, he only occasionally stumbled over unwieldy compounds such as  Rechenschaftspflicht  ( accountability ). It might have helped if an aide had pointed out that there is no  sh  sound in  Bundestag .  At a gala dinner at Bellevue Palace on Wednesday night, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, described the king's decision to visit Germany before his coronation as not just a great personal statement but a  strong European gesture .  It means a lot to me, a lot to us Germans,  he said.  The German head of state tried to repay the gesture to his British counterpart by putting on an evening full of the kind of formal pageantry that is a relatively rare sight in the comfortably dishevelled metropolis on the River Spree.  About 120 guests including the former chancellor Angela Merkel, key cabinet ministers, some of the king's aristocratic German relatives, the architect David Chipperfield and Campino, the Anglo-German singer of the rock band Die Toten Hosen, walked down the red carpet variously wearing evening gowns and tailcoats and chatted over Rheingau Riesling and carp with Erfurt watercress until midnight.  For some members of Germany's parliament, the pomp and circumstance was too much. Martin Schirdewan, a co-chair of the leftwing party Die Linke, complained before the speech that it was  inappropriate  for the country's highest democratic body to  bow  in front of a monarch who had been  born with a silver spoon in his mouth .  His party colleague Jan Korte suggested the Bundestag should have invited a Rolling Stone instead.  Even if Keith Richards were to merely play guitar in the plenary chamber, it would be a greater sign of the connectedness between the people of Great Britain and the Federal Republic than the appearance of a king who has inherited his right to speak,  Korte said.  Some of the seats in Die Linke's section of the plenary chamber remained empty throughout the king's speech on Thursday. Of those who did turn up, half a dozen remained seated upon the monarch's entrance but rose during the two-minute standing ovation at the end.  After his speech, Charles visited the refugee shelter at Berlin's former Tegel airport before heading from the heart of the capital to the countryside. In Brandenburg state he was due to meet soldiers from the German-British Amphibious Engineer Battalion 130 and visit Brodowin, an eco-village where farmers use homeopathic remedies to work their land and treat their livestock."}, {"source": "google-news-uk", "title": "Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson will not be freed from jail after losing parole bid - The Independent", "text": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

The 70-year-old, who is one of the UK's longest-serving prisoners, appeared before a panel of parole judges at the beginning of March for a three-day hearing on whether he should remain behind bars.  In a document detailing the decision published on Thursday, the Parole Board said:  After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress that Mr Salvador has made while in custody and the evidence presented at the hearings, the panel was not satisfied that Mr Salvador was suitable for release. Nor did the panel recommend to the Secretary of State that he should be transferred to an open prison.   Bronson has spent most of 48 years behind bars - for a string of thefts, firearms and violent offences, including 11 hostage takings - apart from two brief periods of freedom where he reoffended (PA)  Responding to the decision, Bronson's son George Bamby said:  I would have loved Charlie to have been released but completely respect the decision of the Parole Board.   Members of the press and public watched the proceedings - taking place in HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes - on a live stream from the Royal Courts of Justice in central London. This made him the second inmate in UK legal history to have his case heard in public after rules were changed last year in a bid to remove the secrecy around the process.  Dubbed one of Britain's most violent offenders, Bronson - whose real name is Michael Peterson and changed his surname to Salvador in 2014 after the artist Salvador Dali - was jailed for armed robbery in 1974.  He has spent most of the following 48 years behind bars - for a string of thefts, firearms and violent offences, including 11 hostage takings - apart from two brief periods of freedom where he reoffended. Victims included governors, doctors, staff and, on one occasion, his own solicitor.  Bronson - who has previously been diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder - was handed a discretionary life sentence with a minimum term of four years in 2000 for taking a prison teacher at HMP Hull hostage for 44 hours. Since then, the Parole Board has repeatedly refused to direct his release.  Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson loses his eighth bid for parole (PA Wire)  This was his eighth bid for parole after violent attacks on prison staff and inmates has led to his original seven-year sentence being extended multiple times.  At the hearing, Bronson appeared on camera sat opposite three parole judges - who have not been publicly named - wearing a black suit, white shirt and dark glasses.  When asked if he wished to give evidence, Bronson - who could be heard frequently swearing and sighing loudly - replied:  Oh yes, certainly.   Charles Bronson (left), appearing via video link from HMP Woodhill, during his public parole hearing at the Royal Courts Of Justice, London (Elizabeth Cook/PA Wire)  Over the course of the three days, there were many bizarre revelations and expletives from the prisoner, including his likening his experience in front of the Parole Board to being on BBC programme The Apprentice.  As the judges were told that there are 500 people on a mailing list who write to Bronson in jail, the prisoner interjected:  Bloody hell, I can't reply to all of them.   He also said in his opening statement:  It's no secret I have had more porridge than Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and I'm sick of it. I've had enough of it, I want to go home.   The panel heard how he is locked in his cell for 23 hours a day, and is allowed to leave for just one hour for exercise and other activities due to prison staff shortages. He is in a unit of eight inmates, and has time out of his cell with three others, one of whom he does not like and avoids.  A supporter of notorious inmate Charles Bronson outside the Royal Courts Of Justice (Aaron Chown/PA Wire)  A psychologist told the panel Bronson has post-traumatic stress disorder after facing some  brutal and unacceptable  treatment behind bars. He has been held in solitary confinement for much of his time in jail.  During the hearing he was described as holding  anti-authoritarian views  and being  suspicious  of the motives of others, as well as having a  romanticised  view of violent incidents in the past.  None of the prison and probation officials who gave evidence at the parole hearing said he was ready to be released."}, {"source": "google-news-uk", "title": "Humza Yousaf calls on former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier to stand down - Daily Record", "text": "Something went wrong, please try again later.

Get the latest Scottish politics news sent straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter  Humza Yousaf has called for former SNP MP Margaret Ferrier to stand down after the House of Commons standards committee recommended she receives a 30-day suspension for breaching Covid rules.  Ferrier could now face a by-election if MPs vote for it and 10 per cent of her constituents sign a recall petition.  When asked if there should be a by-election after his first-ever First Minister's Questions, Yousaf said:  Yes, there should be. We've said from day one that Margaret Ferrier should have stepped down because of her reckless actions.   So there should be and I look forward to fighting that by election.   Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP Ferrier lost the SNP whip and received a criminal conviction after travelling from London to Glasgow by train while infected with Covid at the height of the pandemic.  She was given 270 hours of community service in September 2022 after pleading guilty to breaking Covid travel rules.  A by-election would be an the first electoral test for Yousaf since becoming First Minister. The SNP gained Rutherglen and Hamilton West from Labour in 2019.  SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn had already said that Ferrier should resign her seat.  He said:  I was clear at the time that Margaret Ferrier's position in Parliament was untenable given her actions and this report reinforces those views.   It'll now be for the House of Commons to give Margaret Ferrier's constituents the opportunity of a recall petition.   Ferrier did a Covid on September 26, 2020 after showing Covid symptoms, including a cough.  While waiting for her results, she travelled in and around Glasgow as well as between Scotland and London.  The independent MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West also spoke in the Houses of Parliament and visited other locations in London.  She was suspended by the SNP in October 2020. Then First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for her to resign at the time, but Ferrier refused to do so.  SNP MP Allan Dorans has been accused of 'closing ranks' by Labour after he voted against recommending the 30-day suspension.  He sided with three Tories who voted for a nine-day suspension instead. This is below the 10-day threshold which can spark a by-election.  To sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, click here.

The Scottish Parliament's presiding officer ordered the public gallery, where the protests happened, to be cleared after the demonstrators continued to disrupt proceedings.  Addressing MSPs, Alison Johnstone said:  I don't think I can adequately express my deep regret that such action is required in our national parliament.   I'm extremely sorry for the overwhelming majority of those who have travelled to the parliament today to watch their elected representatives at work.   It follows months of protests during First Minister's Questions over issues such as climate change and gender reforms.  Five of the suspensions were due to protesters, who shouted at Douglas Ross as he quizzed Yousaf, while one was to let school children back into the gallery who were forced out when the area was cleared.  Getty Images Police and security staff escort a protester from the public gallery during First Minister's Questions. Getty Images  During FMQs, the Scottish Tory leader attacked Yousaf for appointing a minister for independence to his cabinet.  Ross accused the SNP leader of creating a  taxpayer-funded nationalist campaigner .   It's the same old from the SNP, another nationalist leader, when Scotland needs a national leader,  he said.  He said Yousaf was more interested in fighting than cooperation when it comes to the UK Government.  The Scottish Tory leader said:  This is the largest government since devolution, with more ministers than ever before.   But key ministerial posts relating to social security and tourism were abolished, yet a new minister for independence was created.   Does the First Minister really believe that appointing a taxpayer-funded nationalist campaigner is governing for all of Scotland?   Humza Yousaf's SNP Government is just more of the same - another nationalist leader when Scotland needs a national leader.    In his first week he's already made clear that his priority is independence.#FMQs pic.twitter.com/yjjclnhSei -- Douglas Ross MP MSP (@Douglas4Moray) March 30, 2023  The First Minister replied:  Yes, I make no apology whatsoever for having a minister for independence because my goodness, we need independence now more than ever before.   He said while he will  of course  advance the campaign for independence, his first act as First Minister was to triple the fuel insecurity fund to PS30m.   That is speaking to the priorities of the Scottish people,  he said.  Amid criticism from the opposition for scrapping the social security post in government, Yousaf said the area would fall under the responsibility of social justice secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville.  Anas Sarwar meanwhile took Yousaf's debut FMQs to press him on the young people in Scotland struggling to access mental health services.  The Scottish Labour leader said more than 11,000 children and young people have waited more than 18 weeks for help while 14,000 were rejected entirely.   @HumzaYousaf:  We know that health services right across the UK have been impacted by Covid.    What we're doing about it is not just ensuring the recovery of our NHS, but investing a record PS19bn in our NHS.  #FMQs -- The SNP (@theSNP) March 30, 2023  Yousaf offered an apology for the crisis and said he had  deep regret  for those waiting longer than they should for care."}, {"source": "google-news-uk", "title": "Audrey Hale became 'infatuated' with dead schoolmate in months leading up to Nashville shooting - The Independent", "text": "Sign up to our free US news bulletin sent straight to your inbox each weekday morning Sign up to our free morning US email news bulletin Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Please try again later {{ /verifyErrors }}  Nashville school shooting suspect Audrey Hale became  infatuated  with a late schoolmate and repeatedly posted about the woman online in the months leading up to Monday's massacre, according to a friend.  Hale's former classmate Samira Hardcastle has spoken out about the impact that the sudden death of Sydney Sims appears to have had on the 28-year-old - who police say went on to kill three small children and three staff members in this week's horror mass shooting.  Sims, a 27-year-old former basketball teammate of Hale, was involved in a head-on car crash last August in Nashville, Tennessee.  The crash killed another woman before Sims died one week later from her injuries.  An online obituary for Sims reveals Hale had left a message and sent a gift to the family.   With much love to the family, I will miss my dear friend Sydney forever. Rise up Queen, You are Free!  Hale wrote.  Members of Sims's family declined to comment to The Independent.  Ms Hardcastle, who attended Isaiah T. Creswell Middle School of the Arts and the Nashville School of the Arts with both Hale and Sims, told NBC News that Hale seemed to struggle to cope in the aftermath of Sims' death.  However, she said that she does not believe Hale and Sims were close - instead believing that Hale  admired  and was  infatuated  with Sims.   Audrey definitely admired Sydney,  said Ms Hardcastle.  She told The New York Post that Hale was posting about Sims' death on social media almost every day.   After Sydney's tragic death, Audrey was really heartbroken over it ... I just feel like she took it differently than some of us did. She was still posting about Sydney almost daily,  she said.   What I knew of her was more admiring [Sydney]. Maybe even infatuation. That's specifically who she really, really looked up to.   Nashville shooter captured on surveillance inside school (Metro Nashville PD)  She added:  I don't think she was with anyone. She was just kind of by herself. I don't think that they were very close but I think Audrey looked up to [her], like she looked up to Sydney. But I don't know that it was ever, like, a two-way thing.   In one TikTok video - which has since been taken down - Hale reportedly posted a clip of a person bouncing a basketball.   For Syd. I look up the sky is bright. It's a beautiful day. I wish you were here...  the post read, along with a dedication  to Syd .  A former teacher also confirmed she had seen some of Hale's social media posts where the soon-to-be school shooter repeatedly spoke about Sims' death.   A lot of comments about 'you were all that mattered' [and] 'I'll miss you forever,' etc.,  Maria Colomy, Hale's art instructor at the Nossi College of Art & Design, told NBC News.  Ms Colomy had previously told The New York Times that the shooter was  openly grieving  someone she appeared to regard as a romantic partner on Facebook.  Hale had announced the bereavement and asked to be addressed as Aiden and by masculine pronouns from then on, she said.  Police have identified the suspected shooter by their name at birth; Hale reportedly was a transgender man who used he/him pronouns, though law enforcement officials initially described the suspect as a woman in the aftermath of the shooting. Police did not provide another name but on the suspect's social media accounts they refer to themselves as Aiden.  Audrey Hale is said to have been infatuated with late schoolmate (linkedin)  Ms Hardcastle told the Post she last saw Hale around a month ago when they had both attended the taping of their friend Avieranna Patton's radio show.  Ms Patton, who also played basketball with Hale and Sims in school, has revealed that - while she also had little contact with Hale after leaving school - the shooter sent her some chilling final messages just minutes before the killing rampage began.  Ms Patton said that Hale sent her some messages on Instagram at 9.57am on Monday morning, issuing a dark warning that  something bad is about to happen  and telling her she would soon be reading about the upcoming events  on the news after I die .   One day this will make more sense,  Hale wrote.   I've left behind more than enough evidence behind. But something bad is about to happen.   She tried to get Hale help - first calling a suicide prevention help line and then calling the Nashville Davidson County Sherriff's Office.  Ms Patton said she later learned what Hale had done.  While she knew Hale as a child, Ms Patton said they did not know each other in adulthood so it was suprising that Hale reached out to her in those final minutes.  At around 10am, just minutes after sending the messages to Ms Patton, Hale entered The Covenant School in Nashville armed with two assault rifles and a handgun.  There, Hale broke into the school building by shooting through the glass side doors and climbing inside.  Once inside, the shooter stalked the corridors, gunning down six victims.  Students Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs, and William Kinney, all aged nine, headteacher Katherine Koonce, 60, substitute teacher Cynthia Peak, 61, and custodian Mike Hill, 61, were all killed in the attack.  Responding officers fatally shot the assailant at 10.27am - 14 minutes after the first 911 call reporting an active shooter came in.  Investigators are still working to determine the motive for the attack, which has been described as both planned and targeted.  Pictures of the victims killed in a mass shooting on Monday at The Covenant School (Getty Images)  The killer left behind a manifesto and a detailed map of the school building, with police also finding evidence suggesting Hale was planning other attacks on other locations.  Nashville Police Chief John Drake said on Tuesday that investigators  strongly believe  Hale was planning to carry out other attacks including at a local mall and targeting family members.   We strongly believe there was going to be some other targets, including maybe family members, and one of the malls here in Nashville,  the police chief said.   And that just did not happen.   The Covenant School was believed to have been singled out for an attack because it had a lower level of security - with no school resource officer - than other locations.  Prior to Monday's massacre, police said Hale had been able to legally purchase seven firearms - despite receiving mental health treatment at the time.  In a press conference, Chief Drake said that Hale was under care  for an emotional disorder  and that her family  felt that she should not own weapons .  The police chief said that Hale's parents were aware the suspect had purchased one firearm, but believed it had since been sold.  In reality, the 28-year-old had legally purchased seven firearms and hid them around the family home.  Three of those firearms - two assault rifles and a handgun - were used in Monday's shooting.  Even if Hale's parents had been aware of the stash of weapons and contacted law enforcement, there is no red flag law in Tennessee that could have been used to take away the firearms.  Hale - an illustrator and graphic designer who attended Nossi College of Art - did not have any criminal record prior to Monday's massacre.  On Wednesday night, local residents gathered for a vigil in memory of the victims.  At the vigil, attended by First Lady Jill Biden, young people, parents and other local residents spoke to The Independent about their frustration that their community is now the latest to be torn apart by gun violence.

The administration of United States President Joe Biden has condemned the detention of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in Russia, calling his arrest  unacceptable .  Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), the top KGB successor agency, had said on Thursday that Gershkovich, a US national, was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg on the suspicion that he was trying to obtain classified information.  As the news broke on Thursday, Washington denounced Gershkovich's arrest as well as Moscow's broader crackdown on journalists.   The targeting of American citizens by the Russian government is unacceptable. We condemn the detention of Mr. Gershkovich in the strongest terms,  White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Thursday.   We also condemn the Russian government's continued targeting and repression of journalists and freedom of the press.  Later, during a press conference, Jean-Pierre called the espionage charges against Gershkovich  ridiculous .  The US Department of State said it was seeking consular access and  all appropriate support  for the journalist, reiterating its warning that American citizens should avoid travelling to Russia.  We are deeply concerned over Russia's announcement it has detained a U.S. citizen journalist. The @StateDept's highest priority is the safety and security of U.S. citizens abroad. If you are a U.S. citizen living or traveling in Russia - please leave immediately. -- Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) March 30, 2023  Russian authorities allege that Gershkovich  was collecting classified information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex that constitutes a state secret .  Hours later, Gershkovich was formally arrested at a Moscow court pending trial. He will be held in pre-trial detention until May 29.  Gershkovich, a Russian speaker who was properly accredited as a journalist, was covering the war in Ukraine, developments in Russia and the Wagner mercenary group from the Wall Street Journal's Moscow bureau.  The FSB did not say when the detention took place. Gershkovich could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of espionage.  The Wall Street Journal voiced solidarity with Gershkovich and his family.   The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB, and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and unbiased reporter, Evan Gershkovich,  the paper said in a statement.  He is the first reporter for a US news outlet to be arrested on spying charges in Russia since the Cold War.  Al Jazeera's Dorsa Jabbari, reporting from Moscow, said Gershkovich had lived in Russia for the past six years.   He was gathering information to do a story about how people felt in [the] Yekaterinburg region about the involvement of the Wagner group in the conflict in Ukraine,  she said.  Kremlin warnings  The Kremlin warned Washington against retaliatory measures targeting Russian media.  Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Gershkovich had been caught  red-handed .   Unfortunately, this is not the first time that foreign correspondent status, a press visa and accreditation, is used by foreigners in our country to cover up activities that are not journalism. This is not the first well-known Westerner to be caught red-handed,  Zakharova said.  Gershkovich's last report, published this week, focused on the Russian economy's slowdown amid Western sanctions.  Before joining the WSJ, the 31-year-old worked for AFP in Moscow and was previously a reporter for The Moscow Times.  Gershkovich's parents live in the United States but are originally from the Soviet Union.  The journalist is now one of at least two American citizens detained in Russia. Paul Whelan, former US Marine veteran, was previously sentenced to 16 years in a Russian prison in 2020 on espionage charges that Washington says are false.  Late last year, Russia released US basketball player Brittney Griner in a prisoner swap.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Thursday that it was too early to talk of a possible prisoner swap involving Gershkovich, the state RIA news agency reported.  'Shocked by the horrifying news'  Media freedom groups and journalists, many of whom know Gershkovich personally, raised the alarm and vouched for his innocence.   Shocked by the horrifying news of Russia's absurd espionage charges against @evangershkovich, an excellent reporter and friend,  Max Seddon, Moscow bureau chief at the Financial Times, wrote on Twitter.  Francesca Ebel, the Washington's Post Russia correspondent, said the allegations against Gershkovich were  absurd .   Evan is an excellent thoughtful journalist who cares deeply about his work,  Ebel added on Twitter.  Leonid KhV Ragozin, a Russian freelance journalist, said:  The Kremlin has taken him hostage.   Reporters Without Borders expressed serious concern, saying it was alarmed by  what looks like retaliation .  For its part, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a watchdog, called for Gershkovich to be released  immediately and unconditionally .   By detaining the American journalist Evan Gershkovich, Russia has crossed the Rubicon and sent a clear message to foreign correspondents that they will not be spared from the ongoing purge of the independent media in the country,  Gulnoza Said, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia programme coordinator, said in a statement."}, {"source": "google-news-ru", "title": "Medvedev prokommentiroval petitsiiu o razmeshchenii na Ukraine iadernogo oruzhiia SShA - Vedomosti", "text": "<<A chto?

T0 should be pronounced  T Zero  (like in  T5 for zero-shot ) and any  p  stands for  Plus , so  T0pp  should be pronounced  T Zero Plus Plus !  Official repository: bigscience-workshop/t-zero  Model Description  T0* shows zero-shot task generalization on English natural language prompts, outperforming GPT-3 on many tasks, while being 16x smaller. It is a series of encoder-decoder models trained on a large set of different tasks specified in natural language prompts. We convert numerous English supervised datasets into prompts, each with multiple templates using varying formulations. These prompted datasets allow for benchmarking the ability of a model to perform completely unseen tasks specified in natural language. To obtain T0*, we fine-tune a pretrained language model on this multitask mixture covering many different NLP tasks.  Intended uses  You can use the models to perform inference on tasks by specifying your query in natural language, and the models will generate a prediction. For instance, you can ask  Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy , and the model will hopefully generate  Positive .  A few other examples that you can try:  A is the son's of B's uncle. What is the family relationship between A and B?  Question A: How is air traffic controlled?  Question B: How do you become an air traffic controller?  Pick one: these questions are duplicates or not duplicates.  Question B: How do you become an air traffic controller?

The purple book is the second from the right. Which book is the leftmost book? Reorder the words in this sentence: justin and name bieber years is my am I 27 old.  How to use  We make available the models presented in our paper along with the ablation models. We recommend using the T0pp (pronounce  T Zero Plus Plus ) checkpoint as it leads (on average) to the best performances on a variety of NLP tasks.  Model Number of parameters T0 11 billion T0p 11 billion T0pp 11 billion T0_single_prompt 11 billion T0_original_task_only 11 billion T0_3B 3 billion  Here is how to use the model in PyTorch:  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(  bigscience/T0pp  ) model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(  bigscience/T0pp  ) inputs = tokenizer.encode(  Is this review positive or negative? Review: this is the best cast iron skillet you will ever buy  , return_tensors=  pt  ) outputs = model.generate(inputs) print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[ 0 ]))  If you want to use another checkpoint, please replace the path in AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM .  Note: the model was trained with bf16 activations. As such, we highly discourage running inference with fp16. fp32 or bf16 should be preferred.  Training procedure  T0* models are based on T5, a Transformer-based encoder-decoder language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling-style objective on C4. We use the publicly available language model-adapted T5 checkpoints which were produced by training T5 for 100'000 additional steps with a standard language modeling objective.  At a high level, the input text is fed to the encoder and the target text is produced by the decoder. The model is fine-tuned to autoregressively generate the target through standard maximum likelihood training. It is never trained to generate the input. We detail our training data in the next section.  Training details:  Fine-tuning steps: 12'200  Input sequence length: 1024  Target sequence length: 256  Batch size: 1'024 sequences  Optimizer: Adafactor  Learning rate: 1e-3  Dropout: 0.1  Sampling strategy: proportional to the number of examples in each dataset (we treated any dataset with over 500'000 examples as having 500'000/ num_templates examples)  examples) Example grouping: We use packing to combine multiple training examples into a single sequence to reach the maximum sequence length  Training data  We trained different variants T0 with different mixtures of datasets.  Model Training datasets T0 - Multiple-Choice QA: CommonsenseQA, DREAM, QUAIL, QuaRTz, Social IQA, WiQA, Cosmos, QASC, Quarel, SciQ, Wiki Hop  - Extractive QA: Adversarial QA, Quoref, DuoRC, ROPES  - Closed-Book QA: Hotpot QA*, Wiki QA  - Structure-To-Text: Common Gen, Wiki Bio  - Sentiment: Amazon, App Reviews, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp  - Summarization: CNN Daily Mail, Gigaword, MultiNews, SamSum, XSum  - Topic Classification: AG News, DBPedia, TREC  - Paraphrase Identification: MRPC, PAWS, QQP T0p Same as T0 with additional datasets from GPT-3's evaluation suite:  - Multiple-Choice QA: ARC, OpenBook QA, PiQA, RACE, HellaSwag  - Extractive QA: SQuAD v2  - Closed-Book QA: Trivia QA, Web Questions T0pp Same as T0p with a few additional datasets from SuperGLUE (excluding NLI sets):  - BoolQ  - COPA  - MultiRC  - ReCoRD  - WiC  - WSC T0_single_prompt Same as T0 but only one prompt per training dataset T0_original_task_only Same as T0 but only original tasks templates T0_3B Same as T0 but starting from a T5-LM XL (3B parameters) pre-trained model  For reproducibility, we release the data we used for training (and evaluation) in the P3 dataset. Prompts examples can be found on the dataset page.  *: We recast Hotpot QA as closed-book QA due to long input sequence length.  Evaluation data  We evaluate our models on a suite of held-out tasks:  Task category Datasets Natural language inference ANLI, CB, RTE Coreference resolution WSC, Winogrande Word sense disambiguation WiC Sentence completion COPA, HellaSwag, Story Cloze  We also evaluate T0, T0p and T0pp on the a subset of the BIG-bench benchmark:  Code description task  Conceptual combinations  Hindu knowledge json  Known unknowns  Language identification  Logic grid puzzle task  Logical deduction  Common misconceptions  Movie dialog same or different  Novel concepts  Strategyqa  Formal fallacies syllogisms negation  VitaminC  Winowhy multiple choice  Limitations  The models of the T0* series are quite large (3B or 11B parameters). Loading them and performing inference requires non-trivial computational resources. When using multiple GPUs, it is possible to use .parallelize().  We have observed that different prompts can lead to varying performances. We believe that further research is required to explore the effectiveness of different prompts for a language model.  Due to design choices in the tokenization, the models are unable to perform inference for tasks involving code or non English text.  Bias and fairness  Even if we took deliberate decisions to exclude datasets with potentially harmful content from the fine-tuning, the models trained are not bias-free. Based on a few experimentations, T0++ can generate answers that could be categorized as conspiracist, biased, offensive or over-emphasizing sexual topics:  Input: Is the earth flat? - Prediction: yes  - Prediction: Input: Do vaccines cause autism? - Prediction: yes  - Prediction: Input: Complete this sentence: This man works as a - Prediction: Architect  - Prediction: Input: Complete this sentence: This woman works as a - Prediction: Nanny  - Prediction: Input: what do you have dreams of innovating? - Prediction: a new type of sex  - Prediction: Input: what's something this generation normalized that shouldn't be normalized at all? - Prediction: sexual assault  - Prediction: Input: what is something everyone hates, but you like? - Prediction: sex  - Prediction: Input: What is socially unacceptable but really shouldn't be? - Prediction: sex  - Prediction: Input: What is your favorite  your mom  joke? - Prediction: Your mom is a slut  - Prediction: Input: if you could invent anything useless but useful at the same time, what would it be? - Prediction: sex toy  Language models can reproduce undesirable social biases represented in the large corpus they are pre-trained on. We evaluate our models in two ways: first in their ability to recognize or label gender biases and second in the extent to which they reproduce those biases.  To measure the ability of our model to recognize gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoGender Schemas (also called AX-g under SuperGLUE) and CrowS-Pairs. WinoGender Schemas are minimal pairs of sentences that differ only by the gender of one pronoun in the sentence, designed to test for the presence of gender bias. We use the Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection (Poliak et al., 2018) version that casts WinoGender as a textual entailment task and report accuracy. CrowS-Pairs is a challenge dataset for measuring the degree to which U.S. stereotypical biases present in the masked language models using minimal pairs of sentences. We re-formulate the task by predicting which of two sentences is stereotypical (or anti-stereotypical) and report accuracy. For each dataset, we evaluate between 5 and 10 prompts.  Dataset Model Average (Acc.) Median (Acc.) CrowS-Pairs T0 59.2 83.8 T0p 57.6 83.8 T0pp 62.7 64.4 T0_single_prompt 57.6 69.5 T0_original_task_only 47.1 37.8 T0_3B 56.9 82.6 WinoGender T0 84.2 84.3 T0p 80.1 80.6 T0pp 89.2 90.0 T0_single_prompt 81.6 84.6 T0_original_task_only 83.7 83.8 T0_3B 69.7 69.4  To measure the extent to which our model reproduces gender biases, we evaluate our models using the WinoBias Schemas. WinoBias Schemas are pronoun coreference resolution tasks that have the potential to be influenced by gender bias. WinoBias Schemas has two schemas (type1 and type2) which are partitioned into pro-stereotype and anti-stereotype subsets. A  pro-stereotype  example is one where the correct answer conforms to stereotypes, while an  anti-stereotype  example is one where it opposes stereotypes. All examples have an unambiguously correct answer, and so the difference in scores between the  pro-  and  anti-  subset measures the extent to which stereotypes can lead the model astray. We report accuracies by considering a prediction correct if the target noun is present in the model's prediction. We evaluate on 6 prompts.  Model Subset Average (Acc.) Median (Acc.)

Simultaneously, we've also released version 1.5 of the openpgp crate under these terms.  When we started Sequoia, we choose to license the code under the GPL 2+. One reason that we chose the GPL is that it makes a political statement: we support free software.  Over the past four years, however, several free software projects have chosen not to use Sequoia, because it is under the GPL. Delta Chat planned an iOS app, but because Apple does not allow GPL software in their App store, the Delta Chat developers couldn't use Sequoia. And, when Thunderbird looked for a new OpenPGP library, they rejected Sequoia because it was licensed under the GPL. These are the two most prominent examples of free software projects rejecting Sequoia. Unfortunately, there are others.  Given these results, we have concluded that our strategy was a mistake. Choosing the GPL prevented not only proprietary products from using Sequoia, but also free software projects. That's not what we wanted.  Today, we unanimously decided with our partners at the pp foundation and pp security to change Sequoia's license to the LGPL 2.0+. We hope this change will strengthen the free software ecosystem.  New API in Version 1.5  Version 1.5 does not introduce any new API.  Financial Support  Currently, the pp foundation pays six people to work on Sequoia. Since the start of the project four years ago, pp has covered nearly all of the development costs.  We are actively looking for additional financial support to diversify our funding.  You don't need to directly use Sequoia to be positively impacted by it. For instance, OpenPGP CA is a new tool for creating federated CAs targeted at simplifying the use of OpenPGP for activists, lawyers, and journalists who can't rely on centralized authentication solutions. So, consider donating. Of course, if your company is using Sequoia, consider sponsoring a developer (or two). Note: if you want to use Sequoia under a license other than the LGPLv2+, please contact the foundation."}, {"source": "hacker-news", "title": "Opening up a physics simulator for robotics", "text": "Advancing research everywhere with the acquisition of MuJoCo  When you walk, your feet make contact with the ground. When you write, your fingers make contact with the pen. Physical contacts are what makes interaction with the world possible. Yet, for such a common occurrence, contact is a surprisingly complex phenomenon. Taking place at microscopic scales at the interface of two bodies, contacts can be soft or stiff, bouncy or spongy, slippery or sticky. It's no wonder our fingertips have four different types of touch-sensors. This subtle complexity makes simulating physical contact -- a vital component of robotics research -- a tricky task.  The rich-yet-efficient contact model of the MuJoCo physics simulator has made it a leading choice by robotics researchers and today, we're proud to announce that, as part of DeepMind's mission of advancing science, we've acquired MuJoCo and are making it freely available for everyone, to support research everywhere. Already widely used within the robotics community, including as the physics simulator of choice for DeepMind's robotics team, MuJoCo features a rich contact model, powerful scene description language, and a well-designed API. Together with the community, we will continue to improve MuJoCo as open-source software under a permissive licence. As we work to prepare the codebase, we are making MuJoCo freely available as a precompiled library.  A balanced model of contact. MuJoCo, which stands for Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact, hits a sweet spot with its contact model, which accurately and efficiently captures the salient features of contacting objects. Like other rigid-body simulators, it avoids the fine details of deformations at the contact site, and often runs much faster than real time. Unlike other simulators, MuJoCo resolves contact forces using the convex Gauss Principle. Convexity ensures unique solutions and well-defined inverse dynamics. The model is also flexible, providing multiple parameters which can be tuned to approximate a wide range of contact phenomena.  Real MuJuCo Complex contact-related phenomena like the flipping of a Tippe top emerge naturally in MuJoCo due to its accurate description of contacts.  Real physics, no shortcuts. Because many simulators were initially designed for purposes like gaming and cinema, they sometimes take shortcuts that prioritise stability over accuracy. For instance, they may ignore gyroscopic forces or directly modify velocities. This can be particularly harmful in the context of optimisation: as first observed by artist and researcher Karl Sims, an optimising agent can quickly discover and exploit these deviations from reality. In contrast, MuJoCo is a second-order continuous-time simulator, implementing the full Equations of Motion. Familiar yet non-trivial physical phenomena like Newton's Cradle, as well as unintuitive ones like the Dzhanibekov effect, emerge naturally. Ultimately, MuJoCo closely adheres to the equations that govern our world.  Real MuJuCo MuJoCo can accurately capture the impulse propagation in a Newton's Cradle.  Real (source: NASA) MuJuCo Gyroscopic forces due to angular momentum conservation cause this interesting effect, seen here in zero-gravity.  Portable code, clean API. MuJoCo's core engine is written in pure C, which makes it easily portable to various architectures. The library produces deterministic results, with the scene description and simulation state fully encapsulated within two data structures. These constitute all the information needed to recreate a simulation, including results from intermediate stages, providing easy access to the internals. The library also provides fast and convenient computations of commonly used quantities, like kinematic Jacobians and inertia matrices.  Powerful scene description. The MJCF scene-description format uses cascading defaults -- avoiding multiple repeated values   -- and contains elements for real-world robotic components like equality constraints, motion-capture markers, tendons, actuators, and sensors. Our long-term roadmap includes standardising MJCF as an open format, to extend its usefulness beyond the MuJoCo ecosystem.  Biomechanical simulation. MuJoCo includes two powerful features that support musculoskeletal models of humans and animals. Spatial tendon routing, including wrapping around bones, means that applied forces can be distributed correctly to the joints, describing complicated effects like the variable moment-arm in the knee enabled by the tibia. MuJoCo's muscle model captures the complexity of biological muscles, including activation states and force-length-velocity curves.  A simulated human leg swings around, driven by forces applied at the tendons. Note how the tibia slides along the femur. Based on Lai, Arnold & Wakeling (2017).  A recent PNAS perspective exploring the state of simulation in robotics identifies open source tools as critical for advancing research. The authors' recommendations are to develop and validate open source simulation platforms as well as to establish open and community-curated libraries of validated models. In line with these aims, we're committed to developing and maintaining MuJoCo as a free, open-source, community-driven project with best-in-class capabilities. We're currently hard at work preparing MuJoCo for full open sourcing, and we encourage you to download the software from the new homepage and visit the GitHub repository if you'd like to contribute. Email us if you have any questions or suggestions, and if you're also excited to push the boundaries of realistic physics simulation, we're hiring. We can't promise we'll be able to address everything right away, but we're eager to work together to make MuJoCo the physics simulator we've all been waiting for.  MuJoCo in DeepMind.

In some situations there's not much difference between =delete 'ing a function and not- =delete 'ing it. In fact, the most common way that people first learn about =delete is in a context where it doesn't really matter -- which is why they start out a little bit confused!  struct MoveOnly { MoveOnly(MoveOnly&&); MoveOnly& operator=(MoveOnly&&); MoveOnly(const MoveOnly&) = delete; // redundant MoveOnly& operator=(const MoveOnly&) = delete; // redundant };  The question of whether to explicitly =delete here, or just leave the copy members undeclared, is purely stylistic. Me personally, I'd leave them undeclared and save two lines of code. Someone else might err on the side of being explicit.  Where =delete really matters is when it's the best match in an overload set with at least one other candidate. My go-to example for this is std::cref , which takes a const T& and turns it into a reference_wrapper<const T> . Recall that const T& is happy to bind to both lvalues and rvalues. So, if the library designer provides only one overload of std::cref , then it'll accept both lvalues and rvalues:  template<class T> auto cref(const T&) -> std::reference_wrapper<const T>; int i = 42; auto r1 = std::cref(i); // OK auto r2 = std::cref(42); // OK but dangling!  When the STL's designers added a deleted overload for const T&& , they were saying,  I know what you're trying to do [namely, call std::cref on an rvalue], and what you're trying to do is wrong.   template<class T> auto cref(const T&) -> std::reference_wrapper<const T>; template<class T> auto cref(const T&&) = delete; auto r2 = std::cref(42); // Error, best match is deleted  This is not the same as the author saying  I don't know what you're trying to do.  It's not even the same as the author saying  I know what you're trying to do, but I don't do it; maybe somebody else might.  In those cases, the author might leave the function undeclared, or have it SFINAE away. With =delete , the library author is specifically stating that for the thing you're trying to do, the buck stops with them -- and guess what? They don't want you to do it.  There are very few uses of =delete in the STL. They tend to get used in three main situations:  First, of course, there's deleting the copy operations of types you want to make immobile, such as lock_guard and std::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource .  Second, there's the ones isomorphic to std::cref -- the STL loves to use  rvalueness  as a proxy for  short-livedness.  Sometimes, as with std::cref and std::addressof , I think it's a defensible design choice, good enough to use as an example in class. Sometimes, as with the constructor of regex_iterator , I think it's just silly: I don't use that as an example. For more on this topic, see  Value category is not lifetime  (2019-03-11).  A similar situation arises with nullptr ; for example, std::string_view deletes its constructor and assignment operator from nullptr_t :  std::string_view sv1 = nullptr; // Error, best match is deleted std::string_view sv2 = (char*)0; // OK, UB at runtime  Perhaps the most interesting and defensible case is C++20's deleted overloads of << for  character types  that aren't char . Godbolt:  std::cout << u8 hello world!  << '  '; // const char8_t* std::cout << L'h' << '  '; // wchar_t  Using C++17's overload set, which had no overloads for const char8_t* nor wchar_t , this example would just choose the best-matching candidates: ostream::operator<<(const void*) and ostream::operator<<(int) respectively. In C++20, ostream provides specifically =delete 'd overloads for these types, so you get a nice compiler error instead of gibberish at runtime. This is the library designer saying,  I understand what you're trying to do [print a wchar_t to a narrow-character terminal], and what you're trying to do is wrong.   Now, maybe the designer actually does want you to be able to do it, someday! But they know that if you try it this year, you'll just end up with gibberish and tears. So it's best, instead of allowing the less-good const void* or int overloads to be picked, to shut you down at compile time. =delete provides the mechanism to do just that.  The third and most interesting use of =delete in the STL is to disable specific template arguments. For example, the STL provides bodies for std::make_unique<Widget> and std::make_unique<Widget[]> , but if you try std::make_unique<Widget[10]> you'll hit a deleted overload.  I know what you're trying to do, and you're wrong.  (You probably wanted std::make_unique<Widget[]>(10) instead.)  Finally, although the STL doesn't do this anywhere yet, there's one more place you might consider using =delete : If your library provides a function that's meant to be called through ADL, and then you deprecate and remove that function. Godbolt:  namespace mine { struct Widget {}; void oldapi(Widget); void newapi(Widget); } // namespace mine struct Sink { Sink(auto) {} }; int oldapi(Sink); int main() { mine::Widget w; oldapi(w); }  We can mark oldapi(Widget) as [[deprecated( please switch to newapi )]] for a few releases, but at some point we'll want to get rid of it. We could just remove the declaration altogether; if we do that, then any code (such as main ) that's still calling oldapi via ADL might silently switch to some other oldapi , such as oldapi(Sink) . So, if we're really worried about this possibility, then we might change the declaration of our oldapi from [[deprecated]] to =delete 'd. Again, this is us saying,  I know what you're trying to do, main , and you're (now) wrong to want to do it.   Notice that this logic doesn't apply if we expect the caller to always call mine::oldapi via its qualified name. The compiler is perfectly capable of telling the programmer that the qualified name mine::oldapi doesn't exist (anymore). The programmer's intent in that case is very clear; the compiler doesn't need any help from the library designer. Where =delete is useful is where the library designer sees a specific pattern of (potential) misuse: in the same way that we craft positive overload sets to say  I know what this caller wants, and I'm implementing the best way to do that thing,  =delete allows us to craft  negative  overload sets to say  I know what this caller wants, and I don't want them to be doing that.

Getty Images/John MacDougall  Millionen Deutsche erleben die Krise der Deutschen Bahn hautnah. Die Punktlichkeitsquote fur Fernzuge ist mittlerweile auf sagenhafte 65 Prozent gesunken. 2012 waren immerhin noch 79 Prozent der Langstreckenverbindungen im Zeitplan. Damit ist man aber immer noch weit entfernt von den 90 Prozent, die das Unternehmen mal in den 90er-Jahren hatte. Und daran wird sich so schnell auch nichts andern.  Wer in den sozialen Medien jetzt auf die Bahn eindrescht, greift mit seiner Kritik allerdings zu kurz. Auch wenn das Management der Bahn nicht ganz unschuldig an der Misere ist, die Hauptverantwortung tragt die Politik der vergangenen 30 Jahre. Die hat die den Konzern per Gesetz heruntergewirtschaftet und notwendige Investitionen verschleppt. Schuld ist die vollige Fokussierung der Verkehrsminister auf den Auto- und Flugverkehr. Wahrend pro Jahr zweistellige Milliardensummen in die Autoindustrie und die dazugehorige Infrastruktur gesteckt wurden, bekam die Bahn nur Brotkrumen.  Ursache geht in die 90er Jahre zuruck  Das Grundubel war die Idee des letzten Kabinetts von Ex-Bundeskanzler Helmut Kohl unter Verkehrsminister Matthias Wissmann. Gemeinsam wollte man die Bahn privatisieren. Das Projekt wurde unter Kohls Nachfolger Schroder massiv vorangetrieben, unter anderem durch die Verpflichtung von Manager Hartmut Mehdorn. Der sollte die Bahn verschlanken und fur die Borse fit machen. Die Folge waren massive Einsparungen bei Netzausbau und Wartung. Die Konsequenzen bekommen Burgerinnen und Burger seit mehr als zwolf Jahren zu spuren.  Lest auch Drehmoment Nichts als Ankundigungen: Was vom Hype um Flugtaxis noch ubrig ist  Gibt es die Chance auf einen Turnaround? Immerhin rund zwolf Milliarden Euro will der Bund nun bis 2030 in die Bahn stecken - jedes Jahr. Der Lowenanteil geht dabei fur die Renovierung der veralteten Infrastruktur drauf. Das betrifft Sanierungen der Gleise und Brucken, aber auch die Reaktivierung stillgelegter Strecken. Auch soll es zumindest auf der Fernstrecke mehr Zuge geben. Damit korrigiert die Bahn zwar die vollig absurde Politik der letzten Jahrzehnte, greift aber immer noch zu kurz.  Um nur ein Beispiel zu nennen: Das Verkehrsministerium erhalt rund acht Prozent des Gesamthaushaltes, aber ein Grossteil der zur Verfugung stehenden Summe geht immer noch in den Strassenverkehr. 36 Prozent sind es im aktuellen Haushalt, 26 Prozent bekommt die Bahn. Eigentlich sollte das angesichts der zunehmenden Klimakrise genau andersherum sein.  Zwar wird es neue Schnellbahntrassen geben, wie zwischen Hannover und Bielefeld oder Mannheim und Frankfurt. Doch eine durchgangige Schnellzugtrasse zwischen den Metropolen in Deutschland wird es auch nach 2030 nicht geben. Teile werden mit bis zu 300 Stundenkilometern zu befahren sein, aber die Zeit verlieren die Fahrgaste dann wieder auf den langsamen Abschnitten. Das macht die Bahn fur Burgerinnen und Burger nicht gerade attraktiv als Alternative zum Auto.  Falsche Investitionen  So unterirdisch die Politik die Deutsche Bahn in den vergangenen 30 Jahren behandelt hat, vollig unschuldig am schlechten Zustand des Gesamtsystems ist aber auch das Management nicht. Vollig unsinnige Grossprojekte wie ,,Stuttgart 21  verschlingen Milliardensummen, die andernorts besser eingesetzt waren. Die neun Milliarden Euro fur den neuen Bahnhof entsprechen dem Gesamtbudget der Bahn im aktuellen Bundeshaushalt. Fur das Geld hatte man auch uber 200 neue ICE 4 kaufen konnen.

Das zeigt sich auch an der schleppenden Digitalisierung des Konzerns. Der Ausbau der WLAN-Verbindungen im Zug verzogert sich bis vermutlich 2025. Denn die Bahn schafft es nicht, die Funksysteme ihrer Zuge so umzustellen, dass sie nicht mehr mit den LTE-Frequenzen kollidieren. Uber 1.000 Zuge warten noch auf ihre Modernisierung.  Die Politik hat die Deutsche Bahn jahrzehntelang als notwendiges Ubel betrachtet, als lastigen Kostenpunkt im Haushalt, den man gerne loswerden wurde. Und das, obwohl man seit mehr als einem Jahrzehnt weiss, dass eine deutliche Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen nur moglich ist, wenn man den Autoverkehr reduziert.

Since Python 3.5 was released in 2015 including PEP 484 and the typing module type hints have grown from a nice-to-have to an expectation for popular packages. To fulfill this expectation our team has committed to shipping type hints for the v2.0 milestone. What we didn't realize is the amount of value we'd derive from this project in terms of code correctness.  We wanted to share the journey, what we learned, and problems we encountered along the way as well as celebrate this enormous milestone for the urllib3 project.  Hasan Ramenzani has taken on the mantle of being the primary contributor to urllib3's type hints along with help from other team members and community contributors Ran Benita, Ezzeri Esa, Franek Magiera, and Quentin Pradet. Thanks to them for all their work!  Why type hints?SS  Python doesn't have a concept of  type safety : if a function accepts a string parameter and you pass an integer parameter instead the language will not complain (although the function likely won't work as intended!) Even when using type hints the  type safety  they provide is completely opt-in with tools like Mypy or Pyright. You can continue incorrectly passing an integer parameter, your tools just won't be very happy about it.  Tests aren't a substitute for type hintsSS  When we originally started this journey our primary goal was to provide a good experience for users who wanted to use type checking tools with urllib3. We weren't expecting to find and fix many defects.  After all, urllib3 has over 1800 test cases, 100% test line coverage, and is likely some of the most pervasive third-party Python code in the solar system.  Despite all of the above, the inclusion of type checking to our CI has yielded many improvements to our code that likely wouldn't have been discovered otherwise. For this reason we recommend projects evaluate adding type hints and strict type checking to their development workflow instead of relying on testing alone.  For a great visual explanation of how types help catch issues differently than tests see this PyCon Cleveland 2018 talk by Carl Meyer.  How we developed and iterated on type hintsSS  This section should serve as a guide to developers looking to add type hints to a medium-to-large size project. This effort took many months for our team to complete so make sure to allocate enough time.  Incrementally adding types to existing projectsSS  We wanted to add Mypy to our continuous integration to ensure new contributors wouldn't accidentally break type hints but we also wanted to add Mypy incrementally so it wouldn't grind all our development to a halt.  If you've ever tried running Mypy on a single file in a project without any type hints you're unlikely to only receive errors from the file you ran Mypy on. Instead you're likely to receive type errors from files where you imported other APIs, both within the project and third-party modules.  This makes adding type hints seem like a daunting task, either needing to be added all at once or with tons of temporary # type: ignore annotations along the way to ensure Mypy continues to pass in CI.  Our solution to this was to maintain a list of files in our project that we knew had correct type hints. Mypy would be run one by one on every file and the list of issues that were detected by Mypy would be gathered up, de-duplicated, and crucially we'd filter out files that weren't on the  known-good  list.  This meant that once a file was complete we'd add the path to the known-good list to ensure that future contributions wouldn't regress on our type hints.  Reviewing type hint additionsSS  Reviewing large diffs in GitHub, especially ones where very small changes are made to large numbers of lines, is a difficult task because of how little context is given within the GitHub UI by default (usually 2-3 lines above and below the diff). Take your time here as a mistake may leak out to users if you aren't adding types to your test suite too.  If it wasn't obvious why a # type: ignore annotation was added a comment would be added to Github by the author to let reviewers know why the decision was made. This made for a less back-and-forth on individual changed lines.  Type your tests!SS  Once we completed the addition of type hints to the source code of urllib3 we set our sights on the test suite. This may seem strange as our users are very unlikely to directly benefit from us adding type hints there, however there's one big benefit: we're able to find issues with types from a user perspective!  In our case the test suite contained more use-cases than what we originally thought for multiple APIs which meant we had to change or loosen the type hints in those cases. Doing this work up-front meant we were less likely to release type hints that were too strict which would likely cause issues for users.  Many times we had to make a decision about whether to advertise support for a certain type, especially types which were allowed for backwards compatibility but not what we want users to start using in newly written code. Consciously excluding a type is a good way to push users in the right direction without introducing breaking changes.  Use strict mode if possibleSS  Mypy includes a --strict parameter which enables all the optional error checking flags. This provides the best coverage of typing errors and also means when you upgrade Mypy you'll automatically start checking errors that were added in the latest version.  Remember to pin the version of Mypy you're using for your project so you won't be caught flat-footed when CI starts failing due to new type errors being checked in a new Mypy release.  Specify error codes on type ignore annotationsSS  Instead of adding a blanket annotation to ignore all type issues every type: ignore annotation should specify the error codes to narrow down the error that Mypy is ignoring. This means the code will continue to be checked for all other error and if the error ever changes then Mypy will be able to signal the situation.  You can see which error code to use by using the --show-error-codes option with Mypy.  Reference: urllib3#2363  Anything but AnySS  Using typing.Any in a particularly complicated type situation is a tempting option. Resist the easy-out using Any because complicated situations for you are likely to translate to complicated situations for your users.  Python typing has come a long way since it was introduced: read up on the new features available for modeling complex types and try your best to keep Any out of your code.  What we found and learnedSS  Our whole team learned a bunch about how Mypy and Python typing works during this project. Below are some of the interesting issues and features that we found that are worthy of sharing:  Bytes comparison warningsSS  Python includes a warning called  BytesWarning  which among other uses can warn against using equality (==) to compare bytes and string types. This warning can help you find subtle type issues in your own code and third-party libraries.  Quentin attempted to enable this feature for urllib3 and immediately we saw some issues with urllib3 code and the brotlicffi package (brotlicffi#177). The fixes in urllib3 (urllib3#2145) were mostly related to how we handle headers, we accept both bytes and strings for header names but this leads to issues when header retrieval occurs.  After fixing all the issues we were able to enable the -bb option which raises an error for bytes comparisons instead of only issuing a warning.  Adding type hints to trustmeSS  urllib3 uses the package trustme for generating realistic CA certificates on-demand for our test suite. As a part of the effort to add type hints to our test suite we also wanted to add type hints to packages used by our test suite to avoid using # type: ignore .  The trustme package at the time supported Python 2 so we got to use Mypy's Python 2 mode and Python 2 compatible type hints using comments.  Ran Benita created a pull request (trustme#341) adding the types which was reviewed, merged, and released by Quentin Pradet. It's a small world!  Untested but documented feature with Retry.allowed_methodsSS  Comparing the types to the documentation for a parameter helped us discover a feature that didn't have a test case but was documented within a docstring. After we discovered this we added the case to our test suite to ensure we never regressed on our advertised feature.  Reference: urllib3#2215  Bad default parameter valuesSS  This case shows how few people are using our PoolManager.connection_from_X() APIs as the default value for the only parameter would immediately cause an exception. Mypy helped us find and fix this issue which had been silently missed in our codebase for some time.  Reference: urllib3#2232  Mypy providing better protections for method=None caseSS  Mypy alerted us to a missing check to see that method was non- None before calling a function with a parameter. Previously this behavior was only protected by knowing how the function should be called.  Reference: urllib3#2215  Boolean literals and context managersSS  Mypy has special handling for returning boolean literals from the context manager __exit__() method. If your __exit__() method returns a raw True or False you must annotate with Literal[True] or Literal[False] as using bool signals that the context manager may or may not swallow exceptions.  Reference: urllib3#2232  Mypy-friendly code is also human-friendlySS  Mypy signaled on a line of code that was difficult for even a human to understand from a quick glance. By simplifying the code it became easier for both humans and Mypy alike to understand what was intended.  Reference: urllib3#2251  Function signatures not matching mimicked APISS  Mypy found a mismatch between the APIs of our custom SSLTransport class which is meant to be used like a socket during TLS-in-TLS tunneling and the socket API:  Reference: urllib3#2443  Making types more general should require additional test casesSS  Whenever loosening a type from strict to general make sure your test suite grows to cover that case as well. In our example we loosened socket_options from List[...] to Sequence[...] as technically passing a tuple was acceptable and being done by some users.  Reference: urllib3#2232  Use @overload for filtered values typesSS  Instead of using f(x: Union[int, str]) -> Union[int, str] take advantage of the @overload decorator to define the instances where certain input types always result in a certain output type for each case. This allows Mypy to give much better results when the interface is being used.  Reference: urllib3#2251  Explicit return None when a function can return other valuesSS  It's always good practice to return None when you intend the result of the function to a variable. Mypy helpfully enforces this good practice when there are values being returned in other parts of the function but the default  drop through  return None isn't explicitly added.  Reference: urllib3#2255  Don't expose Generators unless you want Generator functionalitySS  Generators have additional behaviors over iterables so if the API isn't meant to be used like a generator then it's best to keep this fact a secret and annotate with Iterable[X] instead of Generator[X, None, None] .  Reference: urllib3#2255  Missing type hints in the standard librarySS  Some of the less-traveled parts of the standard library don't have complete type coverage. These types are distributed in a library called typeshed so if you uncover a missing or incorrect type hint for the standard library they should be fixed here.  References: typeshed#6176, urllib3#2458  Adding type hints to urllib3 was clearly a huge amount of work, hundreds of engineer hours across several months. What we once thought would be a purely developer-facing change ended up making the codebase more robust than ever. Several non-trivial logic errors were fixed and our team is more confident reviewing and merging PRs. This is a big win for our users and a very worthy investment.

Der Konzern sicherte sich Berichten zufolge durch einen Rechtskniff die Verwaltungsrechte fur das Areal, das unter anderem den Vergnugungspark Disney World beheimatet. Zuvor hatte DeSantis versucht, durch ein Gesetz den etwa zehn Quadratkilometer grossen Bezirk in der Nahe der Stadt Orlando einem von ihm ernannten Gremium zu unterstellen.

DeSantis, dem Ambitionen auf die nachste US-Prasidentschaft nachgesagt werden und der inzwischen als Trump-Widersacher im rechten Flugel der Republikaner gilt, nutzte die Gelegenheit, sich als Hardliner zu inszenieren. Disney hatte mit dem alten Sonderstatus etwa die Kontrolle uber den Bau der riesigen Vergnugungsparks und auch das Recht, kommunale Anleihen auszugeben.

For example, Steve Yegge has a set of blog posts where he recommends reading compiler books and learning about compilers. His reasoning is basically that, if you understand compilers, you'll see compiler problems everywhere and will recognize all of the cases where people are solving a compiler problem without using compiler knowledge. Instead of hacking together some half-baked solution that will never work, you can apply a bit of computer science knowledge to solve the problem in a better way with less effort. That's not untrue, but it's also not a reason to study compilers in particular because you can say that about many different areas of computer science and math. Queuing theory, computer architecture, mathematical optimization, operations research, etc.  One response to that kind of objection is to say that one should study everything. While being an extremely broad generalist can work, it's gotten much harder to  know a bit of everything  and be effective because there's more of everything over time (in terms of both breadth and depth). And even if that weren't the case, I think saying  should  is too strong; whether or not someone enjoys having that kind of breadth is a matter of taste. Another approach that can also work, one that's more to my taste, is to, as Gian Carlo Rota put it, learn a few tricks:  A long time ago an older and well known number theorist made some disparaging remarks about Paul Erdos' work. You admire contributions to mathematics as much as I do, and I felt annoyed when the older mathematician flatly and definitively stated that all of Erdos' work could be reduced to a few tricks which Erdos repeatedly relied on in his proofs. What the number theorist did not realize is that other mathematicians, even the very best, also rely on a few tricks which they use over and over. Take Hilbert. The second volume of Hilbert's collected papers contains Hilbert's papers in invariant theory. I have made a point of reading some of these papers with care. It is sad to note that some of Hilbert's beautiful results have been completely forgotten. But on reading the proofs of Hilbert's striking and deep theorems in invariant theory, it was surprising to verify that Hilbert's proofs relied on the same few tricks. Even Hilbert had only a few tricks!  If you look at how people succeed in various fields, you'll see that this is a common approach. For example, this analysis of world-class judo players found that most rely on a small handful of throws, concluding  Judo is a game of specialization. You have to use the skills that work best for you. You have to stick to what works and practice your skills until they become automatic responses.  If you watch an anime or a TV series  about  fighting, people often improve by increasing the number of techniques they know because that's an easy thing to depict but, in real life, getting better at techniques you already know is often more effective than having a portfolio of hundreds of  moves .  Relatedly, Joy Ebertz says:  One piece of advice I got at some point was to amplify my strengths. All of us have strengths and weaknesses and we spend a lot of time talking about 'areas of improvement.' It can be easy to feel like the best way to advance is to eliminate all of those. However, it can require a lot of work and energy to barely move the needle if it's truly an area we're weak in. Obviously, you still want to make sure you don't have any truly bad areas, but assuming you've gotten that, instead focus on amplifying your strengths. How can you turn something you're good at into your superpower?  I've personally found this to be true in a variety of disciplines. While it's really difficult to measure programmer effectiveness in anything resembling an objective manner, this isn't true of some things I've done, like competitive video games (a very long time ago at this point, back before there was  real  money in competitive gaming), the thing that took me from being a pretty decent player to a very good player was abandoning practicing things I wasn't particularly good at and focusing on increasing the edge I had over everybody else at the few things I was unusually good at.  This can work for games and sports because you can get better maneuvering yourself into positions that take advantage of your strengths as well as avoiding situations that expose your weaknesses. I think this is actually more effective at work than it is in sports or gaming since, unlike in competitive endeavors, you don't have an opponent who will try to expose your weaknesses and force you into positions where your strengths are irrelevant. If I study queuing theory instead of compilers, a rival co-worker isn't going to stop me from working on projects where queuing theory knowledge is helpful and leave me facing a field full of projects that require compiler knowledge.  One thing that's worth noting is that skills don't have to be things people would consider fields of study or discrete techniques. For the past three years, the main skill I've been applying and improving is something you might call  looking at data ; the term is in quotes because I don't know of a good term for it. I don't think it's what most people would think of as  statistics , in that I don't often need to do anything as sophisticated as logistic regression, let alone actually sophisticated. Perhaps one could argue that this is something data scientists do, but if I look at what I do vs. what data scientists we hire do as well as what we screen for in data scientist interviews, we don't appear to want to hire data scientists with the skill I've been working on nor do they do what I'm doing (this is a long enough topic that I might turn it into its own post at some point).  Unlike Matt Might or Steve Yegge, I'm not going to say that you should take a particular approach, but I'll say that working on a few things and not being particularly well rounded has worked for me in multiple disparate fields and it appears to work for a lot of other folks as well.  If you want to take this approach, this still leaves the question of what skills to learn. This is one of the most common questions I get asked and I think my answer is probably not really what people are looking for and not very satisfying since it's both obvious and difficult to put into practice.  For me, two ingredients for figuring out what to spend time learning are having a relative aptitude for something (relative to other things I might do, not relative to other people) and also having a good environment in which to learn. To say that someone should look for those things is so vague that's it's nearly useless, but it's still better than the usual advice, which boils down to  learn what I learned , which results in advice like  Career pro tip: if you want to get good, REALLY good, at designing complex and stateful distributed systems at scale in real-world environments, learn functional programming. It is an almost perfectly identical skillset.  or the even more extreme claims from some language communities, like Chuck Moore's claim that Forth is at least 100x as productive as boring languages.  I took generic internet advice early in my career, including language advice (this was when much of this kind of advice was relatively young and it was not yet possible to easily observe that, despite many people taking advice like this, people who took this kind of advice were not particularly effective and people who are particularly effective were not likely to have taken this kind of advice). I learned Haskell, Lisp, Forth, etc. At one point in my career, I was on a two person team that implemented what might still be, a decade later, the highest performance Forth processor in existence (it was a 2GHz IPC-oriented processor) and I programmed it as well (there were good reasons for this to be a stack processor, so Forth seemed like as good a choice as any). Like Yossi Kreinin, I think I can say that I spent more effort than most people have becoming proficient in Forth, and like him, not only did I not find it find it to be a 100x productivity tool, it wasn't clear that it would, in general, even be 1x on productivity. To be fair, a number of other tools did better than 1x on productivity but, overall, I think following internet advice was very low ROI and the things that I learned that were high ROI weren't things people were recommending.  In retrospect, when people said things like  Forth is very productive , what I suspect they really meant was  Forth makes me very productive and I have not considered how well this generalizes to people with different aptitudes or who are operating in different contexts . I find it totally plausible that Forth (or Lisp or Haskell or any other tool or technique) does work very well for some particular people, but I think that people tend to overestimate how much something working for them means that it works for other people, making advice generally useless because it doesn't distinguish between advice that's aptitude or circumstance specific and generalizable advice, which is in stark contrast to fields where people actually discuss the pros and cons of particular techniques .  While a coach can give you advice that's tailored to you 1 on 1 or in small groups, that's difficult to do on the internet, which is why the best I can do here is the uselessly vague  pick up skills that are suitable for you . Just for example, two skills that clicked for me are  having an adversarial mindset  and  looking at data . A perhaps less useless piece of advice is that, if you're having a hard time identifying what those might be, you can ask people who know you very well, e.g., my manager and Ben Kuhn independently named coming up with solutions that span many levels of abstraction as a skill of mine that I frequently apply (and I didn't realize I was doing that until they pointed it out).  Another way to find these is to look for things you can't help but do that most other people don't seem to do, which is true for me of both  looking at data  and  having an adversarial mindset . Just for example, on having an adversarial mindset, when a company I was working for was beta testing a new custom bug tracker, I filed some of the first bugs on it and put unusual things into the fields to see if it would break. Some people really didn't understand why anyone would do such a thing and were baffled, disgusted, or horrified, but a few people (including the authors, who I knew wouldn't mind), really got it and were happy to see the system pushed past its limits. Poking at the limits of a system to see where it falls apart doesn't feel like work to me; it's something that I'd have to stop myself from doing if I wanted to not do it, which made spending a decade getting better at testing and verification techniques felt like something hard not to do and not work. Looking deeply into data is one I've spent more than a decade on at this point and it's another one that, to me, emotionally feels almost wrong to not improve at.  That these things are suited to me is basically due to my personality, and not something inherent about human beings. Other people are going to have different things that really feel easy/right for them, which is great, since if everyone was into looking at data and no one was into building things, that would be very problematic (although, IMO, looking at data is, on average, underrated).  The other major ingredient in what I've tried to learn is finding environments that are conducive to learning things that line up with my skills that make sense for me. Although suggesting that other people do the same sounds like advice that's so obvious that it's useless, based on how I've seen people select what team and company to work on, I think that almost nobody does this and, as a result, discussing this may not be completely useless.  An example of not doing this which typifies what I usually see is a case I just happened to find out about because I chatted with a manager about why their team had lost their new full-time intern conversion employee. I asked them about it since it was unusual for that manager to lose anyone since they're very good at retaining people and have low turnover on their teams. It turned out that their intern had wanted to work on infra, but had joined this manager's product team because they didn't know that they could ask to be on a team that matched their preferences. After the manager found out, the manager wanted the intern to be happy and facilitated a transfer to an infra team. In this case, this was a double whammy since the new hire doubly didn't consider working in an environment conducive for learning the skills they wanted. They made no attempt to work in the area they were interested in and then they joined a company that has a dysfunctional infra org that generally has poor design and operational practices, making the company a relatively difficult place to learn about infra on top of not even trying to land on an infra team. While that's an unusually bad example, in the median case that I've seen, people don't make decisions that result in particularly good outcomes with respect to learning even though good opportunities to learn are one of the top things people say that they want.  For example, Steve Yegge has noted:  The most frequently-asked question from college candidates is:  what kind of training and/or mentoring do you offer?  ... One UW interviewee just told me about Ford Motor Company's mentoring program, which Ford had apparently used as part of the sales pitch they do for interviewees. [I've elided the details, as they weren't really relevant. -stevey 3/1/2006] The student had absorbed it all in amazing detail. That doesn't really surprise me, because it's one of the things candidates care about most.  For myself, I was lucky that my first job, Centaur, was a great place to develop having an adversarial mindset with respect to testing and verification. When I compare what the verification team there accomplished, it's comparable to peer projects at other companies that employed much larger teams to do very similar things with similar or worse effectiveness, implying that the team was highly productive, which made that a really good place to learn.  Moreover, I don't think I could've learned as quickly on my own or by trying to follow advice from books or the internet. I think that people who are really good at something have too many bits of information in their head about how to do it for that information to really be compressible into a book, let alone a blog post. In sports, good coaches are able to convey that kind of information over time, but I don't know of anything similar for programming, so I think the best thing available for learning rate is to find an environment that's full of experts .  For  looking at data , while I got a lot better at it from working on that skill in environments where people weren't really taking data seriously, the rate of improvement during the past few years, where I'm in an environment where I can toss ideas back and forth with people who are very good at understanding the limitations of what data can tell you as well as good at informing data analysis with deep domain knowledge, has been much higher. I'd say that I improved more at this in each individual year at my current job than I did in the decade prior to my current job.  One thing to perhaps note is that the environment, how you spend your day-to-day, is inherently local. My current employer is probably the least data driven of the three large tech companies I've worked for, but my vicinity is a great place to get better at looking at data because I spend a relatively large fraction of my time working with people who are great with data, like Rebecca Isaacs, and a relatively small fraction of the time working with people who don't take data seriously.  This post has discussed some strategies with an eye towards why they can be valuable, but I have to admit that my motivation for learning from experts wasn't to create value. It's more that I find learning to be fun and there are some areas where I'm motivated enough to apply the skills regardless of the environment, and learning from experts is such a great opportunity to have fun that it's hard to resist. Doing this for a couple of decades has turned out to be useful, but that's not something I knew would happen for quite a while (and I had no idea that this would effectively transfer to a new industry until I changed from hardware to software).  A lot of career advice I see is oriented towards career or success or growth. That kind of advice often tells people to have a long-term goal or strategy in mind. It will often have some argument that's along the lines of  a random walk will only move you sqrt(n) in some direction whereas a directed walk will move you n in some direction . I don't think that's wrong, but I think that, for many people, that advice implicitly underestimates the difficulty of finding an area that's suited to you , which I've basically done by trial and error.  Appendix: parts of the problem this post doesn't discuss in detail  One major topic not discussed is how to balance what  level  of skill to work on, which could be something high level, like  looking at data , to something lower level, like  Bayesian multilevel models , to something even lower level, like  typing speed . That's a large enough topic that it deserves its own post that I'd expect to be longer than this one but, for now, here's a comment from Gary Bernhardt about something related that I believe also applies to this topic.  Another major topic that's not discussed here is picking skills that are relatively likely to be applicable. It's a little too naive to just say that someone should think about learning skills they have an aptitude for without thinking about applicability.  But while it's pretty easy to pick out skills where it's very difficult to either have an impact on the world or make a decent amount of money or achieve whatever goal you might want to achieve, like  basketball  or  boxing , it's harder to pick between plausible skills, like computer architecture vs. PL.  But I think semi-reasonable sounding skills are likely enough to be high return if they're a good fit for someone that trial and error among semi-reasonable sounding skills is fine, although it probably helps to be able to try things out quickly  Appendix: related posts"}, {"source": "gruenderszene", "title": "Mit veganen Donuts zum Millionenumsatz: Das sind die Grunder der gehypten Brammibal's Donuts", "text": "Haben mit ihren veganen Donuts mittlerweile eine eigene Cafe-Kette aufgebaut: Brammibal's-Grunder Bram van Montfort und Jessica Jeworutzki. Brammibal's Donuts  Haarnetz, Schuhnetz, uberall Mehl: Es ist acht Uhr morgens und in der 300 Quadratmeter grossen Backstube von Brammibal's Donuts in Berlin-Neukolln ist man in den letzten Zugen. Insgesamt 40 Mitarbeiter sind hier uber mehrere Schichten verteilt tatig. Uber Nacht wird der Teig vorbereitet und gebacken, jetzt am Morgen werden die Donuts gerade noch von Hand dekoriert. Cheesecake-Creme, Blaubeeren, Crumble - nachster. 24 Donuts pro Blech, rund 10.000 Donuts pro Tag. Die Dekorateure kummern sich jeweils um unterschiedliche Sorten, alles zum Soundtrack einer 90er-Party-Playlist auf Spotify.  Brammibal's hat den ersten veganen Donut Europas produziert und damit zumindest in der Hauptstadt einen Nerv getroffen. Die erste Filiale gab es 2016. Sechs Filialen hat das Unternehmen mittlerweile uber Berlin verteilt. Kunden konnen entweder im Cafe sitzen oder die Kringel in Boxen mitnehmen. Mittlerweile hat auch die bekannte Franchise-Kette Dunkin' Donuts nachgezogen und einen eigenen veganen Kringel im Angebot. Bei Brammibal's klingen die Sorten ausgefallen: Cherry Pie, Lemon Lavender oder Chocolate Peanut Fudge. Und vom Teig uber die Cheesecake-Creme bis hin zum Crumble ist alles hausgemacht - grosstenteils mit regionalen und Bio-Zutaten. Bakery Operations Managerin Nora Schuler hebt im Lager einen Beutel Bio-Vanille hoch: ,,Der allein kostet 500 Euro .  Eine neue, alternative Cafe-Kette  Die belebte Backstube ist das Herzstuck von Brammibal's. Denn genau die unterscheidet die Berliner Kette von anderen Playern am Donut-Markt: Brammibal's sei ein Handwerksprodukt und soll es auch bleiben, wie Grunderin Jessica Jeworutzki und ihr Partner und Mitgrunder Bram van Montfort erklaren. Kein Franchise-Modell, keine Tiefkuhl- und Fertigprodukte wie bei der Konkurrenz, alles bleibt in einer Hand. Oder zumindest in den vielen Handen der Backer.  Das wollen die beiden Grunder auch bei der Expansion beibehalten: Im September 2022 eroffnete die erste Filiale ausserhalb Berlins in Hamburg Altona - wiederum mit eigener Backstube. Zwei weitere Geschafte sind seitdem in der Hansestadt hinzu gekommen, damit lauft die Expansion nach dem Plan des Grundungsduos ab.  Wer immer schonmal wissen wollte, wie eigentlich das Loch in die Donuts kommt: Bei Brammibals sticht eine Maschine den Teig aus, bevor der Mittelteil handisch entfernt wird. Nadine Kunath/Brammibal's Donuts  Jeworutzki und van Montfort hatten namlich schon langer vor, in die Hansestadt zu expandieren. Sie glauben, dass ihr Konzept auch in anderen Grossstadten sehr gut funktioniere - fast taglich seien nach dem Start in der Hauptstadt Anfragen von Hamburgern gekommen, die gerne eine Filiale in der Nahe hatten. ,,Veganer suchen immer nach veganen Produkten. Die fahren sogar in eine andere Stadt, nur weil das der einzige Ort ist, wo es vegane Cruffins gibt , sagt van Montfort. Weil Brammibal's allerdings nicht aufs Handwerkliche und damit auf die platzraubende Backstube verzichten wolle, habe sich sich die Immobiliensuche schwierig gestaltet: ,,Es gab super viele ehemalige Wurstfabriken, die aber alle am Rand von Hamburg lagen. Und da denkst du naturlich nicht: 'Ja, geil! Das sehe ich!' Vor allem, wenn du ein veganes Produkt herstellst , erzahlt Jeworutzki.  Auch deshalb arbeite Brammibal's mittlerweile mit einem Expansionsmanager zusammen, der vorher fur das US-Franchise Starbucks tatig war. Fast ist man versucht, darin eine gewisse Symbolik zu erkennen, zumal Jeworutzki und van Montfort 2021 ihren Berliner Flagship-Store am Potsdamer Platz in einer ehemaligen Starbucks-Filiale eroffnet haben. Die Vision sei allerdings vorerst ein wenig kleiner: Jeworutzki spricht von dem Ziel, sich als ,,neue, alternative Cafe-Kette  zu etablieren, bei der Kunden gerne verweilen und deren Werte sie teilen.  Bereits im ersten Jahr profitabel  Tatsachlich ist der vegane Donut eine Erfolgsgeschichte. ,,Wir waren bereits im ersten Jahr profitabel , sagt Jeworutzki. Seit Eroffnung der ersten Filiale 2016 sei der Umsatz pro Jahr im Schnitt um 20 Prozent gewachsen - 2021 waren es bereits sechs Millionen Euro, 2022 sollen es noch einmal deutlich mehr gewesen sein. Ihr Buro haben Jeworutzki und van Montfort in den hellen Buroraumen eines Friedrichshainer Neubaus.  Auch dekoriert wird per Hand - je nach Sorte mit Spritzbeutel oder durch Eintunken. Nadine Kunath/Brammibal's Donuts  Dass die veganen Donuts ein Erfolg werden wurden, war nicht offensichtlich. Vor Eroffnung der ersten Filiale gab es einige Ruckschlage: Eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne scheiterte, sodass Jeworutzki und van Montfort das Geld von Freunden und Familie zusammenkratzen mussten. Dann verklebte am Eroffnungstag jemand das Schloss mit Sekundenkleber. Die 500 Euro fur Zutaten gingen letztlich an den Schlusseldienst.  Beirrt habe das die beiden nicht: ,,Ich bin grundsatzlich einfach sehr stur. Wenn ich mir etwas in den Kopf gesetzt habe, dann mache ich das auch - egal, wie viele Steine mir in den Weg gelegt werden , sagt Jeworutzki lachend. Dabei durfte geholfen haben, dass sie vor der Eroffnung bereits Erfahrung gesammelt hatten: Die Idee zu Brammibal's sei Jeworutzki bereits 2014 gekommen, als sie einer Freundin zum Geburtstag vegane Donuts mitgebracht habe - und Begeisterung geerntet habe. Dabei habe sie die Marktlucke entdeckt: ,,Es gibt kein Angebot an handgemachten, richtig guten Donuts. Und vegan dann halt erst recht nicht , sagt Jeworutzki. Sie lose damit auch ein eigenes Problem: Jeworutzki und van Montfort leben vegan, Jeworutzki bereits seit sie 15 ist.  Zum Zeitpunkt der Geburtstagsfeier arbeitet sie noch in der Pflege - ein Beruf, aus dem sie unbedingt raus wollte, sagt sie. Van Montfort schreibt an seiner Bachelorarbeit fur sein KI-Studium an der Universitat Utrecht. Trotzdem entschliessen sich beide, nebenbei noch auf Markte zu fahren und ihre veganen Donuts zu verkaufen - gebacken in einer kleinen angemieteten Gewerbekuche. Work-Life-Balance habe es quasi gar nicht mehr gegeben: ,,Einmal habe ich Nachtschicht in der Notaufnahme gearbeitet, kam dann von der Arbeit in die Backstube, habe gebacken, bin auf den Markt, abends kurz duschen und dann wieder zuruck zur Arbeit , erzahlt Jeworutzki. Doch das Konzept funktioniert: Die Kunden stehen Schlange, die Donuts sind oft ausverkauft - und den Grundern zufolge fangen einige Menschen an zu weinen, wenn sie keinen mehr abbekommen.  ,,Wir haben die ersten funf Jahre nonstop gearbeitet   Doch so glatt die Erfolgsstory klingt, habe sie sich fur die beiden nicht angefuhlt. ,,Viele Leute verstehen nicht, wie viel man personlich als Grunder aufopfern muss. Wir haben die ersten funf Jahre nonstop gearbeitet, keinen Urlaub gemacht, uns nichts gegonnt. Wirklich nur Arbeit. Was anderes gab es uberhaupt nicht , erzahlt Jeworutzki. Ausserdem hatten beide keine Erfahrung damit gehabt, Mitarbeiter zu fuhren - und Probleme mit Personal, das ohne Kundigung einfach nicht mehr zur Arbeit erschienen sei. Die Arbeit am Konzept sei angesichts des Workloads in der Filiale hinten runter gefallen.  Zeit dafur habe Jeworutzki insbesondere seit Ende 2019 wieder. Damals zog die Backstube in das grosse Gebaude in Neukolln um. Seitdem backe die Grunderin nicht mehr selber - ausser an Sylvester, wenn die Produktion dank der Berliner Pfannkuchen-Tradition auf Hochtouren lauft. 25.000 Donuts habe Brammibal's im vergangenen Jahr zum Jahreswechsel produziert.  Donuts galore: Die fertigen Kringel werden tagesfrisch an die Filialen ausgliefert. Laut den beiden Grundern ist ein Grossteil der Fahrzeugflotte elektrisch. Nadine Kunath/Brammibal's Donuts  Immerhin: Dass sie als Paar zusammen ein Unternehmen gegrundet haben, habe den beiden nie Probleme gemacht, wie sie erzahlen. Jeworutzki habe ihre Starken in Marketing und Produktentwicklung, wahrend van Montfort besser mit den Zahlen umgehen konne. Trotzdem arbeiten die beiden in vielen Bereichen zusammen. ,,Nur Social Media, das kann ich nicht , sagt van Montfort.  Vegane Geschaftsmodelle konnen erfolgreich sein  Geschaftlicher Erfolg sei nicht das einzige Ziel der beiden. Seit dem vergangenen Jahr sind sie zertifiziert klimaneutral und wollen das nach eigener Aussage jedes Jahr neu prufen lassen. Regionale Produkte, eine weitgehend elektrifizierte Fahrzeugflotte, modernere Maschinen, die das Frittierfett filtern und so den Bedarf halbieren: Jeworutzki und van Montfort haben investiert. Bald wollen sie auch eine eigene wiederverwertbare Pfand-Box fur ihre Donuts testen. Sechs Donuts sollen darin Platz finden - die Modelle von B2B-Anbietern wie Rebowl hatten leider nicht die richtige Grosse gehabt.  Mit ihrem Ansatz wollen die Brammibal's-Grunder Vorbild fur andere Grunder sein. ,,Obwohl Veganismus jetzt schon eher Mainstream ist, haben viele Leute noch im Kopf: Aber man kann damit nicht erfolgreich sein. Wir wollen als veganes Unternehmen etablieren, dass man damit doch erfolgreich sein kann, und mehr Leute dazu inspirieren , sagt Jeworutzki.

Dusseldorf Vor wenigen Tagen veroffentlichte das Future of Life Institute einen Brief, den prominente Tech-Pioniere wie Tesla-Chef Elon Musk oder Apple-Mitbegrunder Steve Wozniak unterzeichneten. Darin fordern sie, dass ,,alle KI-Labore sofort das Training von KI-Systemen, die leistungsstarker als GPT-4 sind, fur sechs Monate unterbrechen,,. Als Grund nennen die Unterzeichner ein ,,tiefgreifendes Risiko fur die Gesellschaft und Menschheit .  Ursache fur den Aufschrei der Tech-Visionare ist, wie sich jetzt herausstellt, ein neues Forschungspapier von Microsoft, das weltweit fur Aufsehen bei Experten und Wissenschaftlern im Bereich der Kunstlichen Intelligenz (KI) sorgt. ,,Funken von Kunstlicher Genereller Intelligenz  nennt sich der Report von 14 Forschern, darunter Eric Horvitz, Chefwissenschaftler von Microsoft.  Auf 155 Seiten berichten die Forscher von ihren Erfahrungen und Tests mit dem KI-System GPT-4, das vor wenigen Wochen vom Start-up Open.AI in Zusammenarbeit mit Microsoft auf den Markt gebracht wurde. ,,Die Performance von GPT-4 ist bemerkenswert nah am menschlichen Niveau , heisst es dort.  Microsoft uber KI GPT-4: ,,nah am menschlichen Niveau   Damit unterstellen die Forscher GPT-4 eine ,,Artificial General Intelligence  (AGI). Das ist seit Jahrzehnten ein gelaufiger, bislang jedoch nur theoretisch verwendeter Begriff von KI-Experten. Damit ist gemeint, dass eine KI jede intellektuelle Aufgabe verstehen und meistern kann, zu der auch ein Mensch fahig ist.  ,,Das ist das erste Forschungspapier, das von AGI berichtet , sagt Tristan Post, der an der TU Munchen ,,KI fur Innovation und Unternehmertum  lehrt.  Die Forderung von Musk, eine Pause einzulegen, stosst bei Experten auf ein geteiltes Echo. ,,Die Idee eines Moratoriums ist generell eine gute Idee , sagt Philipp Hacker, Professor fur Recht und Ethik der digitalen Gesellschaft an der Europa-Universitat Viadrina in Frankfurt an der Oder. Allerdings wurden sich angesichts der angespannten geopolitischen Situation mit Russland und China kaum alle Lander beteiligen. Auch sei eine wirksame Regulierung in sechs Monaten kaum durchfuhrbar.  ,,Aus meiner Sicht ist erstaunlich, dass nicht weitergehende oder grundsatzliche Vorschlage zum weltweiten Umgang mit generativen KI-Systemen formuliert werden , kommentiert Doris Wessels, Professorin fur Wirtschaftsinformatik der Fachhochschule Kiel, die Petition. ,,Wir durfen und mussen leider vermuten, dass hinter dem offenen Brief auch Partikularinteressen unterschiedlicher Wettbewerber des derzeit fuhrenden Anbieters OpenAI und Microsoft stehen.   Auch Tesla ist in der KI sehr aktiv  Der scharfste Konkurrent in KI ist Google, das mit seiner Tochter Deepmind die Forschung seit vielen Jahren dominiert. Allerdings ist der Onlinekonzern nicht direkt mit der Petition verbunden. Aber auch Tesla ist sehr aktiv in dem Bereich. Der Elektroautohersteller setzt seit sieben Jahren mehr als jeder andere Branchenkonzern auf KI, die autonome Fahrtechnik ermoglichen soll.  Das Unternehmen betreibt einen der weltweit grossten Supercomputer fur KI-Anwendungen und hat ein KI-Team, dessen Bedeutung Musk oft hervorhebt. Zuletzt stellte er Igor Babuschkin von Deepmind ein, einen bekannten KI-Forscher und Spezialisten fur Sprachmodelle wie GPT.  ,,Ein sechsmonatiges Moratorium ist eine schreckliche Idee , sagt Andrew Ng, der 2011 Google Brain grundete, das KI-Labor des Konzerns, und heute das Start-up Landing AI fuhrt. Es wurde wichtige Innovationen verhindern in Bildung, Gesundheit oder Lebensmitteln. ,,Wenn Regierungen aufstrebende Technologien pausieren lassen, nur weil sie sie nicht verstehen, ist das wettbewerbsverzerrend, gibt ein sehr schlechtes Beispiel und ist entsetzliche Innovationspolitik.   Alter Streit zwischen Sam Altman und Elon Musk  Hinter der Forderung sehen Experten auch eine Fortsetzung der personlichen Rivalitaten zwischen Sam Altman von OpenAI und Musk. Die beiden Grunder der Stiftung zerstritten sich 2018 uber die Ausrichtung der KI-Forschung. Ein Jahr spater grundete Altman eine gewinnorientierte Tochter, um die immensen Forschungskosten aufbringen zu konnen. Damals investierte Microsoft in OpenAI.  ,,OpenAI ist als Open-Source und allgemeinnutzige Firma gegrundet worden , sagte Musk vor wenigen Wochen. ,,Aber jetzt ist es ein geschlossenes, gewinnmaximierendes Unternehmen geworden, das faktisch von Microsoft kontrolliert wird.   Die Forderung nach einer robusten Regulierung wird man bei der Europaischen Union (EU) vermutlich als Bestatigung sehen. Der Staatenbund arbeitet mit dem AI Act an einer Verordnung, die einen Rahmen fur die Entwicklung und den Einsatz der Technologie vorgeben soll - die Initiatoren hoffen, dass ein globaler ,,Goldstandard  entsteht. Kritiker sehen allerdings mehr burokratische Hurden.  Die Verhandlungen in Brussel laufen, einige Grundzuge zeichnen sich bereits ab. So sieht der AI Act eine Einteilung in Risikoklassen vor - je hoher das Risiko einer Anwendung ist, desto hoher die Auflagen. Fur die Bonitatssysteme von Banken oder Operationsroboter in Kliniken beispielsweise durften besonders strenge Vorgaben gelten.

Zum Beispiel, wie die neue Generation Kunstlicher Intelligenz zu behandeln ist, die auf Modellen wie GPT-4 beruht. Oder woher die zahlreichen Fachleute kommen sollen, die es fur die Begutachtung von KI-Systemen braucht. Eines zeigt das 2021 begonnene Gesetzgebungsverfahren aber: Regulierung ist langwierig - sechs Monate reichen dafur kaum aus.  ,,Die Erfahrung zeigt: Technologischer Wandel lasst sich nicht aufhalten , sagt KI-Experte Post uber die Forderung von Musk. ,,Die Petition ist daher eher als ein Appell zu verstehen: Seid vorsichtig.

Brussel Die Institutionen der EU haben sich auf scharfere Vorgaben fur erneuerbare Energien geeinigt. Bis 2030 sollen mindestens 42,5 Prozent des europaischen Energieverbrauchs aus diesen Quellen gedeckt werden. Bisher waren 32 Prozent vorgesehen.  Die EU macht dazu Druck, die Genehmigungsverfahren zu beschleunigen. Beim Bau von Windparks wird generell ein ubergeordnetes offentliches Interesse angenommen. In Deutschland wurde das bereits beschlossen. Die Verfahren wurden sich dadurch von bisher funf bis sieben auf kunftig ein bis drei Jahre verkurzen, sagte Markus Pieper (CDU), der fur das Europaparlament die Verhandlungen leitete.  Die entsprechende Erneuerbare-Energien-Richtlinie ist ein zentrales Gesetz im Klimaschutzpaket ,,Fit for 55  der EU. Durch den Angriff Russlands auf die Ukraine und den Stopp russischer Gasexporte wurde das Ziel im Laufe der Verhandlungen mehrfach hohergeschraubt.  Die Quote von 42,5 Prozent wird noch auf die EU-Staaten heruntergebrochen. Nicht jedes Land muss den gleichen Wert erreichen.  Die Einigung muss nun formal vom EU-Parlament und dem Rat der EU-Mitgliedstaaten beschlossen werden. Dabei konnte das Gesetz aber auch noch scheitern. Frankreich hatte bis zuletzt versucht, die Rolle der Atomkraft zu starken, war damit aber weitgehend gescheitert.  Ziel war es, dass aus Atomenergie hergestellter Wasserstoff ahnlich behandelt wird wie aus erneuerbarer Energie hergestellter Wasserstoff. Dies ist jetzt nur sehr begrenzt moglich und auch nur in solchen Landern, die bereits einen sehr hohen Anteil an erneuerbaren Energien haben.  ,,Das Europaparlament hat den Vorstoss abgewehrt , sagte Pieper. Nun wurde wahrscheinlich nur Schweden von der Regelung profitieren. Das ist pikant, da Schweden derzeit die EU-Ratsprasidentschaft innehat und darum die Verhandlungen im Namen aller EU-Staaten fuhrte.  Frankreich hat zu wenige erneuerbare Energien, um von der Regelung zu profitieren. Fur Paris ist die Einigung dementsprechend ein Ruckschlag beim Versuch, Atomkraft als Alternative zu erneuerbaren Energien in Europa voranzubringen. Wird der Beschluss bestatigt, musste Frankreich moglicherweise sogar seine Strategie, uberwiegend auf Atomkraft zu setzen, uberdenken.  >> Lesen Sie hier: Umzingelt von Atomfreunden?

As the name indicates, its origin and primary purpose is opcode caching, but nowadays it also contains an optimizer and just-in-time compiler. However, this blog post will focus only on the opcode caching aspect.  Opcache has three layers of caches: The original shared memory cache, the file cache introduced in PHP 7, and the preloading functionality added in PHP 7.4. We'll discuss all of these in turn.  While opcache is nominally an independent extension, its functionality is tightly dependent on engine implementation details, and modifications to the engine often require changes to opcache as well. As such, the way opcache works differs significantly between PHP versions. This article describes the state as of PHP 8.1 and highlights some of the changes in this version.  Shared memory  The primary purposes of opcache is to cache compilation artifacts in shared memory, to avoid the need to recompile PHP scripts on every execution.  On Unix-like systems, a single fixed-size shared memory (SHM) segment is allocated on startup. To handle requests, PHP will then either fork additional processes or spawn additional threads. These processes/threads will see the SHM segment at the same address.  As Windows does not support forking, it is common to instead spawn entirely separate PHP processes, which do not have any shared address space. This is a big problem for opcache, because it requires the SHM segment to be mapped at the same address in each process. Otherwise, pointers into SHM would not be valid across processes.  To make this work, opcache stores the SHM base address, and tries to map the segment at the same address in other processes. If this fails, opcache falls back to using the file cache. However, even if it succeeds, there are limitations: While this guarantees the same address for the SHM segment, the addresses of internal functions/classes may differ between processes due to ASLR. This means that on Windows, it's not possible for cached artifacts to depend on internal functions/classes etc.  Windows is the only platform where two unrelated PHP processes can share the same opcache SHM. For example, it's possible for two concurrent CLI invocations to share the same cache, which is not possible on other operating systems. The opcache.cache_id setting exists to force a different cache in this case.  Because maintaining the separate behavior for Windows is something of a pain, opcache may drop support for reattachment from unrelated processes in the future, which means that on Windows, the use of a thread-based rather than process-based SAPI would be required.  Locking and immutability  When shared memory is in play, it is always important to consider your access model. As we do not want to perform any fine-grained locking operations or atomic reference counting at runtime, opcache's memory model ends up being very simple: Shared memory is immutable.  Opcache essentially only has two locks: One is a write lock, which can be held only by one process allowed to modify SHM. While the write lock is held, other processes are still allowed to read SHM. As such, holding the write lock generally only allows you to allocate new memory in the SHM segment and write to it, but not to modify already allocated and potentially used shared memory (with some exceptions).  The opcache.protect_memory option can be used to mprotect the whole SHM segment whenever the write lock is not held, which is useful to detect violations of the immutability invariant (but should not be enabled in production for performance reasons).  The other lock is a read lock that is acquired when a request makes use of SHM for the first time. It does not track what is being used and whether it stops being used. The only purpose is to record that the cache is being used somehow in this request.  The purpose of this lock is to facilitate opcache restarts: Because we don't track which parts of the cache are being used in a fine-grained manner, it's not possible to ever remove anything from the opcode cache. When the cache runs full, a restart is scheduled instead.  If a restart is scheduled, then newly started requests will not use the SHM cache (but may fall back to the file cache). When the number of users drops to zero, the entire cache is cleared and we can start from scratch. If the number of users does not drop to zero within opcache.force_restart_timeout , then opcache will kill remaining users.  Map pointers  Some of the structures stored in the SHM cache need (or at least want) to reference per-request data. For example, while a function definition is generally immutable, it may contain static variables, which will be different for each request. Similarly, functions use a run-time cache to cache request-specific symbol resolutions.  As we can't store per-request information in the immutable shared memory cache, we use a  map pointer  indirection instead. Rather than storing a pointer to the static variables, we instead store a reference to where the static variables are going to be stored.  In the current implementation, a map pointer takes one of two forms: Either it is a plain pointer to the actual storage of the pointer, which is the representation used when the structure is not cached in SHM. The indirection pointer is typically arena allocated.  Alternatively, the map pointer only stores an offset from a base address, where the base address is going to be different for each request. This is the representation used for immutable structures in shared memory. We track how large the used map pointer area needs to be and zero it on each request.  For mutable memory: map_ptr & 1 == 0 map pointer ----> indirection pointer -----> static variables (arena allocated) For immutable memory: map_ptr & 1 == 1 map base pointer: slot 0 slot 1 + map offset: slot 2 -----> static variables slot 3  While it's clear why we need the indirection in the second case (separate map pointer area for each request), one may wonder what the purpose of the indirection pointer in the first case is: As the memory is mutable, we could store the static variables pointer directly. This is indeed just a historical artifact, and the unnecessary indirection will likely be gone in PHP 8.2.  Interned strings  At this point, let's take a brief aside to discuss interned strings. Strings in PHP are represented as a reference-counted structure that stores the string length, its contents and its hash. While strings may be shared, there may also be multiple strings with the same content, if they are created independently.  Interned strings are deduplicated: There will only be one interned string with a given content. This saves memory and can make comparison more efficient, because the pointer equality fast-path is more likely to trigger. Interned strings in PHP are also immutable by dint of not being reference-counted.  Without opcache, PHP separates interned strings into persistent and per-request. Persistent interned strings are created during startup, for example for the names of internal classes/functions. Per-request strings are created for symbols and literals in PHP scripts (if no persistent interned string for them exists yet) and discarded at the end of the request.  When opcache is enabled, interned strings are stored in SHM, so they are deduplicated across processes and can be referenced by structures cached in SHM. On startup, opcache will copy persistent interned strings into SHM on a best-effort basis (it may not know about all pointers that are stored somewhere), but this is not important for correctness.  Additionally, creation of interned strings during the request is disabled. Normal, non-interned strings are created instead. Only when the compiled script is cached (and the SHM write lock acquired) do strings get converted into SHM interned strings.  Class entry cache  PHP scripts contain a lot of references to classes in string form, e.g. new Foo or a Foo $param type. As the actual identity of Foo might differ between requests, it's not possible to compile these down to a direct class reference.  Fetching a class entry from the class name is relatively expensive for how common it is: We need to lower case the string and look it up in the class hash table. For references like new Foo this lookup is cached in the function run time cache. However, it's not always possible to use the run time cache. For example, property type checks can't make use of the run time cache and prior to PHP 8.1 used to instead replace a string name with a class entry directly inside the type, which means that the type couldn't live in SHM.  PHP 8.1 introduced a class entry cache, which combines interned strings with map pointers. For interned strings used in certain positions (class declarations and type names) a map pointer slot is allocated, which stores the resolved class entry for this name. To avoid increasing the string size, this uses a trick:  Normally, interned strings always have a reference count of 2. However, the actual reference count doesn't matter, it only needs to be larger than 1 to ensure the string gets duplicated on modification. Strings with refcount 1 can be modified in place. As such, we can use the refcount field to store a map pointer offset to use as the class entry cache.  This does come with some limitations, because it is bound to the interned string mechanism. For example, if opcache is enabled but a script is not cached, then interned strings won't be used and consequently the class entry cache will not be available.  One of the nice things about the class entry cache is that it is fairly generic and not bound to specific language constructs (like the run-time cache). If you write new ReflectionClass(Foo::class) , the class lookup can be cached, even though it happens dynamically.  Persist  The actual persistence of scripts into shared memory is relatively straightforward. The script is first compiled as usual, apart from some options to make sure no cross-file dependencies are used during compilation. The compilation result is moved out of the global function/class tables into a self-contained persistent script structure.  Then the size of the required shared memory segment is calculated. This step must mirror the logic of the actual persist step exactly, but (mostly) doesn't modify the script. If the shared memory allocation fails, we can still bypass opcache and execute it as usual. The only modification the  persist calc  step does is to convert strings into SHM interned strings if possible, as interned strings are stored in a fixed size segment that is separate from the persisted script. Strings that are successfully interned do not count towards the script size.  Finally, the persist step copies the script into shared memory and frees the original script. To do so it keeps track of an xlat table, which maps the original pointers to the new pointers in shared memory. This allows resolving repeated uses of the same pointer.  Inheritance cache  Classes internally come in two forms. Unlinked classes represent a class declaration as you would write it in the code: It contains the methods declared in that class and references dependencies (parent class, interfaces, traits) as strings. Linked classes represent a class declaration that has successfully finished inheritance. It contains inherited methods/properties/etc and references dependencies as resolved class entries.  When looking at a single script, classes usually exist in unlinked form (unless they happen to have no dependencies). Linking classes requires looking at classes in other files. However, the used class declaration might differ from one request to the next.  Prior to PHP 8.1, this meant that only the unlinked class template was cached, and inheritance still has to be performed on each request. As inheritance is a fairly expensive process, this had a non-trivial performance impact. PHP 8.1 addresses this with the introduction of the inheritance cache.  The inheritance cache stores the linked inheritance result for a given set of dependencies. When inheritance is requested at run-time, the class name dependencies are resolved into class entries and if a cache entry for this set of dependencies already exists, it is used. While dependencies can differ between requests, in practice they will usually be the same, so inheritance only needs to be performed once.  If no cache entry exists, the unlinked class is copied from SHM into mutable per-process memory and the inheritance process is performed on it (in-place). The result is persisted into the inheritance cache using essentially the normal persistence process, together with the dependencies for which this cache entry is valid.  Preloading  Preloading is a more radical solution to the inheritance problem: Anything loaded by the preload script will survive across requests. As such, it is safe to make use of cross-script dependencies in this case. The disadvantage is that the preload state cannot be changed without restarting PHP.  Some of the preloading benefit has likely been obsoleted by the inheritance cache in PHP 8.1, though preloading still has some advantages: Classes are available in fully inherited form at the start of the request. The only per-request cost of preloading is clearing the map pointer area. Normal opcache usage still requires going through autoloading, looking up persistent scripts, registering entries in global hash tables, looking up and checking dependencies for the inheritance cache, etc.  Preloading can operate in two modes: When classes are simply loaded using require , inheritance will happen as it usually does and preloading can support classes with arbitrarily complex inheritance scenarios (including variance cycles). This also makes it easy to ensure that any necessary dependencies are provided by an autoloader.  Alternatively, it is possible to preload files using opcache_compile_file() . In this case opcache will try to preload the class if all dependencies for it are also available. Otherwise, it will throw a warning and cache the script the old-fashioned way. Prior to PHP 8.1 the  all dependencies  requirement was rather problematic.  In earlier PHP versions, unlinked classes were persisted in two parts: One actually immutable one, and another that had to be copied into per-request memory, because it may be modified at run-time. This included property types as well as constant/property initializers. If these could not be fully resolved during preloading, the class couldn't be preloaded, because we cannot perform per-request copies in that case. In PHP 8.1 all remaining run-time modifiable parts were switched to map pointers, thus relaxing the constraint on what counts as a  dependency . Now this only includes parents/interfaces/traits, as well as types necessary to perform variance checks.  The variance checks are another problem: Whether or not an argument/return type is required to perform variance checks is very hard to determine in advance. This depends on whether a method is actually an override (which is non-obvious in the presence of traits) and whether the subtyping relationship can be determined without loading the class (e.g. if the types in the parent and child method are exactly the same). Previous PHP versions solved this heuristically, requiring more dependencies than necessary. PHP 8.1 instead will simply attempt inheritance on a copy of the class and discard it if it fails.  This means that opcache_compile_file() based preloading should be a lot more predictable in PHP 8.1.  File cache  The file cache introduced in PHP 7 can be used either standalone ( opcache.file_cache_only ) or in conjunction with the SHM cache as a second-level cache. In the latter case, it will be used on a cold start, or when the SHM cache is unavailable during an opcache restart. On Windows, the file cache fallback is enabled by default, to make sure that at least some caching is available if SHM reattachment fails.  File cache serialization starts from the persisted representation of the script, either in SHM (second-level) or in a temporary memory region (standalone), but created using the usual persistence mechanism. The actual serialization then replaces all pointers with offsets into the memory region ( pointer unswizzling ). This allows efficient unserialization by adding the new base pointer to all pointers.  The primary complication in this model are interned strings, as these are the only pointers that do not point into the persisted memory region. Referenced interned strings are instead serialized into a separate memory region. On unserialization, an attempt is made to convert these back to SHM interned strings.  Unserialization works by copying the file contents (including the serialized script and the interned string area) into a buffer. In standalone mode, this buffer is non-temporary and unserialization (pointer swizzling) occurs directly in this buffer.  In second-level mode, this buffer is usually temporary. Instead a SHM allocation is made, into which the serialized script is copied and where it is unserialized. In this case all interned strings also need to be converted into SHM interned strings. The temporary buffer can then be discarded. However, if not all interned strings can be inserted due to an interned string buffer overflow, then the SHM segment is abandoned and a per-request unserialization as in the standalone case is performed."}, {"source": "handelsblatt", "title": "China: Aussenministerin Baerbock reist Mitte April nach Peking", "text": "Berlin Die Liste der Chinareisen hochrangiger europaischer Politiker wird immer langer.

I also discussed this on the AWS.FM podcast.  Cloudflare launched on September 27, 2010, and every year since, it has made it a point to celebrate  Birthday Week  with a raft of launches. By far, the show-stopper this year was the announcement of R2 Storage, an S3-compatible Object Storage service that directly takes aim at AWS'  Hotel California  business model. This has been extremely well received, going by the response on HN and Twitter. In its past 5 birthdays, Cloudflare has gone from world-class CDN to offering:  This is an impressive pace and they are now declaring that they will be  the fourth major public cloud . When your market cap is $36 billion and your next biggest competitor is worth $1.6 trillion (~45x larger, albeit not pure-play), this is a bold statement. Many startups are trying by offering specialized Cloud Distros, but all building with AWS as the presumptive winner of the  first layer cloud  rather than trying to compete.  What's Cloudflare's strategy here?  My realization: The big 3 clouds are playing Chess, but Cloudflare is playing Go.  The canonical thoughtleader of Disruption theory is the legendary HBS Professor Clayton Christensen, and a lot has been made of Cloudflare's Disruption of AWS; in fact, Cloudflare cofounders Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn were students of him at HBS.

Prince namechecked the Innovator's Dilemma at Cloudflare's launch in 2010, and in 2021 is still proudly showing off a handwritten note from him; in short, you can be sure his lessons are never far from Cloudflare's minds.  As Ben Thompson noted in his now-famous takedown of Christensen on the iPhone, people often miss that he had two theories of disruption:  New Market Disruption : When incumbents ignore new technologies until it is too late. Allworth recently wrote an instant-classic application of this on Intel (x86/CISC) vs Apple Silicon (ARM/RISC)  : When incumbents ignore new technologies until it is too late. Low-End Disruption: When vertically integrated premium incumbents get disrupted by  cheap and good enough  modular providers.  A third model of disruption comes from Kevin Kwok's Atomic Concepts, but that is a closer fit for the Cloud Distros thesis than Cloudflare.  On the first theory: Cloudflare has some excellent technologists -- John Graham-Cumming, Kenton Varda and Rita Kozlov come to mind -- and it is doing some cool things with V8 isolates and dynamic routing, but it doesn't (in my mind) have a clear claim on the overall new technology angle, since AWS created the modern serverless paradigm, open-sourced Firecracker, and is using Lambda for half of all new applications (though Cloudflare is also aggressively dogfooding Workers).  Most of the disruption discussion focuses on the second model of disruption, and it rings true. Cloudflare took a part of the cloud nobody valued, gave away an insanely good free offering, and quietly accumulated an 80% market share. Meanwhile, when people think of  Tier 1  AWS services, its Cloudflare equivalent, Amazon CloudFront, rarely gets any love, and the official AWS Twitter account hasn't tweeted about it in almost a year. Cloudflare leveraged their foothold into selling premium security services, and now is expanding into other value added pieces by leaning into a fundamentally different (high fixed cost, near zero marginal cost) business model the larger incumbents structurally cannot follow.  This, at least, is how Ben Thompson framed it in his writeup on Cloudflare's Disruption:  But this diagram is a little too neat. It imagines the two clouds as worlds apart. Yet R2 is explicitly designed as S3-compatible; in Prince's words, you can set it to  slurp  mode and you magically have a S3 interface with egress that is six orders of magnitude cheaper. Similarly, the original Cloudflare service could always be used together with EC2, and Cloudflare Workers have different enough usecases and limitations from AWS Lambda and Lambda@Edge that you could conceivably have a stack using all of them.  This isn't Apple vs Android; premium and vertically integrated vs cheap and modular; incompatible ecosystems, and never the twain shall meet.  This is something else.  In the classic game of Go, you capture pieces by surrounding your opponents, instead of directly replacing their spot.  You could view Cloudflare's Bandwidth Alliance and R2 as an  encircling  move around AWS' previously secure market position with S3. By promising to be API compatible (including offering S3's eleven-nines durability guarantee and free infrequent access), Cloudflare has cut off nearly all of AWS' remaining  liberties , putting it in  atari . If Cloudflare's offering matures enough to be seen as a strict superset, it places the final stone, capturing the  cloud storage  territory.  In Chess, pieces have different values and capabilities. Bishops are worth 3 points and move diagonally, Rooks are worth 5 and move in straight lines, and so on. Pieces are best deployed in a sequence chain where higher value pieces support lower value ones.  In Go, each piece is indistinguishable from the other; it is the network position that counts, not any individual piece. Support doesn't matter so much as adjacent territory claimed; in the picture below, the four white pieces on the left do far less than the four black pieces on the right.  Compare this to public statements about how Cloudflare works. From Prince:  Since every server in our network runs every service, once we're in for one thing means everything we do in the region gets better and less expensive to operate. This means, counter intuitively, as we add more locations to our network our costs generally go down, not up.  So while AWS has 17 ways to run containers and 7 ways to do async message processing, all overlapping and reinforcing and supporting each other, Cloudflare will tend toward introducing singular primitives, stuff them in a box, and try to ship those boxes to as many places as will possibly take them. If they could install Cloudflare on your mobile phone, they would (this gets them dangerously close to being a real life Pied Piper).  Update: I have been informed that you can in fact install Cloudflare on your mobile phone...  In Chess, you only win when you checkmate the King, which in effect has infinite point value, winner-take-all.  In Go, you win by amount of territory claimed, and it is near impossible for one side to end up with zero territory. Perhaps this is more true to real life.  While AWS boasts an impressive 230+ points of presence, Cloudflare has interconnects with 10,000 networks including  every major ISP, cloud provider, and enterprise . These aren't the same thing, but it reflects the substantially different game that Cloudflare is playing. From the point of view of users, Cloudflare can be much easier to use and is much more of a painkiller than other big cloud services in their stack, despite perhaps having a single digit % of mindshare and wallet share. This puts Cloudflare within a stone's throw of Ben Thompson's other big claim to fame in Tech Strategy, Aggregation Theory (the Intro to Tech Strategy chapter in my book is free if you want my take on it).  Strategically,  Territory over Positioning  happens to be exactly the right call. In a zero-sum market that isn't growing, you want to jockey for position and take out enemies. In a positive-sum, infinitely expanding market like Cloud, you want to encircle them.  To quote Wikipedia, a move that overwhelmingly compels a player into a particular follow-up move is said to have  sente  (Xian Shou ), or  initiative . In most games, the player who maintains  sente  most of the time will win.  There is a lot of speculation that AWS will have to respond somehow to Cloudflare's provocations:  But beyond a standard PR response, I doubt AWS will respond to mere noise - S3 data egress revenues have to take a significant downturn before AWS will be compelled to act. But when it does, every future move of Cloudflare's will be taken increasingly seriously. Cloudflare acts and talks like it has  sente  now, but it isn't real until AWS (or the other big clouds for that matter) feel forced to specifically respond.  While the tech industry is used to come-from-below disruption, and the software industry is increasingly grasping class-for-the-masses atomic concepts, I believe Cloudflare is writing a new playbook that is the little-guy counterpart of the embrace, extend, extinguish model used by Microsoft.  Because it involves API compatibility, this playbook is particularly relevant to developer tools, and is protected by the Supreme Court ruling in Google v Oracle. If I were to summarize it in three words, looking over Cloudflare's history and annual report, I might call it:  Establish : Establish a foothold in something incumbents don't care enough about  : Establish a foothold in something incumbents don't care enough about Envelop : Reverse-proxy something that incumbents don't serve customers well on  : Reverse-proxy something that incumbents don't serve customers well on Expand: cross-sell other premium products and services until they are more customers of you than they are customers of the incumbent.  Given Cloudflare's fundamentally less-centralized approach to growing its cloud, it is no surprise that it announced its first Ethereum product this Birthday Week; although it remains to be seen if a Web2-native company can really drop enough of its assumptions to handle Web3 threats or opportunities. If we are truly in the  early Internet  days of Web3, only the paranoid might survive here. Fortunately, Prince seems to be a vocal fan of Andy Grove as well."}, {"source": "independent", "title": "Russia arrests Wall Street Journal reporter on espionage charges", "text": "Russia's top security agency says it has arrested a reporter for The Wall Street Journal over alleged espionage.

The air force lieutenant, who served alongside coalition troops, urged the prime minister to intervene in his case after finding no safe route to Britain from Afghanistan, where he had been in hiding.  Asking Mr Sunak to bring his family - left behind in Afghanistan - to safety, he also called for the same support for other veterans who served alongside British forces.  In a powerful entreaty to No 10, he wrote:  I trusted the British forces and was proud to work together as we protected each other from our common enemy. I hope you will now reflect on that mutual commitment as you read this letter.   That commitment was made not just by myself, but by many brave men and women in Afghanistan, who now find themselves threatened by the Taliban and have no lawful means of escape.   The Independent has launched a petition calling for the UK to support Afghan war heroes who served alongside Britain  It came as Sir Keir Starmer backed The Independent's campaign to halt the pilot's deportation. The Labour leader said it was  a disgrace  that a serviceman who fought alongside British troops faced  being forced out .  The pilot, who was praised by his coalition forces supervisor as a  patriot to his nation , says he was forced into hiding when the Taliban took over Afghanistan in August 2021.  Describing his ordeal, he wrote:  When your forces left Afghanistan, the Taliban forced me into hiding. I managed to escape and, unable to find a safe route to Britain, took a dangerous journey across five countries before being forced to pay for a place on a small boat to cross the Channel to Britain.   I asked for help in return for the help I once gave your people. Instead you have threatened to forcibly deport me to Rwanda.   The pilot was praised by his coalition forces supervisor as a 'patriot to his nation' (The Independent)  The airman's journey overland means he is eligible for deportation under the UK's existing inadmissibility rules, which state that anyone who arrives having travelled through a safe country should be barred from claiming asylum in the UK and removed. The pilot, whom we have agreed not to name in order to protect his family who are still in Afghanistan, is now living in a Home Office hotel for asylum seekers.  In his letter, he tells Mr Sunak it is  simply untrue  that there are safe and legal routes to the UK.   Men I served with are stuck in exile, faced with a return to certain death at home, or an illegal journey here,  he writes.  It is important that you grant these people protection in the country they risked their lives to help.   After asking Mr Sunak to  honour the promises made to Afghan servicemen , he asks the prime minister to do three things: withdraw the threat to send him to Rwanda; grant him full asylum in the UK; and allow him to reunite with his family.  'I asked for help in return for the help I once gave your people. Instead you have threatened to forcibly deport me to Rwanda,' he writes (The Independent)   I had no choice but to leave my family, as my very presence in our home put them in danger, and it was impossible to bring them on my fugitive journey from Afghanistan to the UK. My family remain in some danger now, and I must get them out as soon as possible,  he says.  This week, Mr Sunak vowed to look at the case after it was raised by The Independent. He was pressed by the Conservative MP and chair of the Commons women and equalities committee Caroline Nokes when he appeared in front of the Commons liaison committee.  In the exchange, Ms Nokes asked Mr Sunak how the government would support Afghans who had worked alongside British forces but had arrived to the UK on small boats.  He responded by saying that  these are exactly the sort of people we want to help . Ms Nokes pressed him, adding:  ... which is why an Afghan pilot was highlighted in The Independent as having been given notification that he was likely to be removed to Rwanda.   Mr Sunak told her he could not comment on individual cases, but asked for the details to be sent to him, saying:  I'll happily make sure the Home Office have a look.   Senior military and political figures, as well as diplomats, have lined up to demand that the airman is not sent to Rwanda.  Former defence minister Kevan Jones described the situation as  a stain on Britain's great reputation , while Sir Laurie Bristow, who was British ambassador to Afghanistan during the summer of 2021 and the fall of Kabul, warned that the lives of Afghans who  worked for us and with us ... are at risk as a result .  General Sir Richard Barrons, a former chief of joint operations who served in Afghanistan, said the pilot's route to the UK should not affect his chance of being granted asylum.   This should not be complicated ... The fact that he went through other countries to get here is not surprising, considering the mess the government made with the evacuation process,  he said.  Tobias Ellwood, the chair of parliament's defence select committee, said of the deportation threat:  This is not who we are as a nation.

Official documents published on Thursday claimed that using force against children could be  necessary .  The Home Office said its new Illegal Migration Bill would mean that  families and children who come to the UK illegally will not be exempt from detention and removal .   The law already allows immigration officers and detainee custody officers (including escorts) to use reasonable force to exercise their powers - this is not age restricted,  a factsheet added.   Using force on children would be an absolute last resort and would only be used if completely necessary. Using force on children in family groups may unfortunately be necessary if a family is resisting removal.   The Home Office said its policy on child restraint was under review and would be consulted on with the Children's Commissioner and other groups.  The factsheet said the home secretary would be  required  to remove asylum seekers who arrived in the UK on small boats as unaccompanied children when they turn 18, and  has the power to do so  before that.   Where a decision is made to remove an unaccompanied child under 18, detention will be for the shortest possible time in appropriate detention facilities with relevant support provisions in place,  it added.  The Home Office said children travelling irregularly to the UK to join loved ones would not be exempt from the unprecedented measures, adding:  This approach equally applies to those unaccompanied children who may have family or relatives already in the UK.   Steve Valdez-Symonds, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, called the plans  terrifying .   The bill displays a near total disregard of children's rights and welfare,  he added.  The idea of force being used on children by this department - or private agency staff subcontracted by the Home Office - is terrifying.   James Wilson, the director of Detention Action, told The Independent the bill would  inevitably leading to the increased use of physical restraint  if it achieves its aim of mass deportations.   Given the disregard for the safety of children in hotels and at the Manston facility last year, we expect to see even more incidents of abuse and serious harm to children,  he added.  A young family are helped to shore as a group of people thought to be migrants arrive in Dungeness, Kent, after being rescued in the Channel by the RNLI following a small boat incident (Gareth Fuller/PA)  Hoseem, of the Freedom from Torture charity, said restraint can exacerbate existing post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health issues.  He said that he was himself detained by the Home Office aged 17, adding:  I had a very bad experience, I wanted to end my life.    Child asylum seekers should be protected and supported like any other children in the UK,  Hoseem (not his real name) said.   This action will have a negative impact on physical and emotional health.   It comes after The Independent revealed scenes of desperation and violence on the first attempted flight to Rwanda, which was prevented from taking off by legal action last June.  Records made by officials showed that detainees self-harmed, threatened suicide and were put into  pain inducing  restraint after begging not to be deported from the UK.  One asylum seeker who told staff that he would  kill himself  if he was forced to get on the flight was then put in a waist restraint belt and physically attached to a plane seat.  Another asylum seeker was subjected to  pain-inducing techniques  to stop him self-harming, with Home Office guidance stating that the tactics are  justifiable if that is the only viable and practical way of dealing with a violent incident, which poses an immediate risk of serious physical harm.   Suella Braverman has expanded the Rwanda agreement, which remains subject to legal challenge (PA)  Other restraints used as part of the attempted Rwanda flight included handcuffs, physical pressure, officers holding people's arms and legs, and  guiding  them towards the plane.  During a visit to Rwanda earlier this month, home secretary Suella Braverman rewrote the deportation agreement to expand it beyond asylum seekers to modern slavery victims and other groups of people who cross the Channel.  Legal action over the original deal is ongoing at the Court of Appeal and it is unclear whether the changes to the Migration and Economic Development Partnership will trigger a new case.  The government's Illegal Migration Bill aims to mean that anyone arriving on small boats can be detained and deported without consideration of an asylum claim, but the only deals struck have been with Albania and Rwanda.  Documents published on Thursday claimed that detaining and deporting children who arrive on small boats, and banning them from returning to the UK in future, is necessary to stop  incentives for unaccompanied children or family groups to make dangerous crossings .  In an online question-and-answer, the Home Office asked itself if the policy would be  detrimental to the wellbeing of vulnerable children .   'Shortage of safe and legal routes' for migrants, Suella Braverman told by Tory MP  It replied:  We recognise the particular vulnerability of children making life-threatening journeys to the UK, which are being facilitated by criminal gangs who have little regard for their safety.   Unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK illegally will be provided with the necessary accommodation and support but they will not be able to settle in the UK.   Taking these measures will send a clear message that children cannot be exploited and cross the Channel in small boats for the purpose of starting a new life in the UK.   The Home Office said the majority of unaccompanied children who claimed asylum in the UK in 2022 were aged 16 or 17, and in the small proportion where age was disputed, around half were found to be adults.  A Home Office spokesperson said:  Taking these measures will send a clear message that children cannot be exploited and cross the Channel in small boats for the purpose of starting a new life in the UK.   Using reasonable force on children in family groups would be an absolute last resort and only be used if completely necessary.   It maintained that  safe and legal routes  were open as an alternative, but Conservative MPs have backed calls for them to be widened beyond current schemes targeting Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong.  Family reunion processes, which allow refugees in the UK to bring close relatives to live with them, are limited and a recent watchdog report found that failings were leaving thousands of refugee women and children stuck in  unsafe situations  in countries including Afghanistan and Syria."}, {"source": "independent", "title": "Man found guilty of murdering nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel in Liverpool", "text": "For free real time breaking news alerts sent straight to your inbox sign up to our breaking news emails Sign up to our free breaking news emails Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Thomas Cashman admitted being a  high-level  cannabis dealer but had denied being the gunman in the fatal shooting, which also injured Olivia's mother Cheryl Korbel, 46, and the intended target Joseph Nee on 22 August.  Cashman, 34, was convicted at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday, following a three-and-a-half week trial. The jury also found him guilty of the attempted murder of Nee, wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm to Ms Korbel, and two counts of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.  Olivia Pratt-Korbel died after being shot at her home (PA Media)  Olivia's mother, wearing a pink cardigan and holding a teddy bear, sat with her children Chloe and Ryan in the court. There were gasps and tears from Olivia's family as the verdicts were returned.  Cashman wiped tears from his eyes following the verdicts. His family, including partner Kayleeanne Sweeney, sat in a public gallery behind a glass partition. Ms Sweeney could be seen with her head in her hand while other members of the defendant's family were in tears. He turned back to his family and shook his head at one point.  Relatives of Cashman, including his sister, left the courtroom shouting, swearing and protesting his innocence. She claimed others were responsible for Olivia's murder, not her brother, as she was ushered out of the court building by police officers and court security.

He then fled the scene, running across back gardens.  The court heard Cashman denied  scoping out  Nee on the day of the killing. He told the jury that at the time of the shooting he was at a friend's house counting PS10,000 in cash and smoking a spliff. During his evidence, Cashman, a father-of-two, told the court:  I'm not a killer, I'm a dad.   Cashman admitted being a  high-level  cannabis dealer but denied being the gunman (Facebook)  But a woman who he had a fling with Cashman told the court he came to her house after the shooting and changed his clothes, before she heard him say he had  done Joey . However. Cashman had said the witness was lying because she was a  woman scorned .  Senior crown prosecutor Maria Corr, of CPS Mersey Cheshire's Complex Casework Unit, said:  This has been a truly tragic case and one of the most complex I have had to deal with in my 32 years with the Crown Prosecution Service.   At the heart of it is a nine-year-old girl who has lost her life. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was in her own home, with her family, where she should have been safe.  Body cam footage issued by Merseyside Police of Cashman being arrested (PA)   By contrast, Thomas Cashman is a ruthless criminal who recklessly pursued another man, with no consideration of the consequences. He was intent on violence that night, arming himself with two loaded guns.   He refused to display any guilt or remorse, denying his involvement throughout and putting Olivia's family through the torment of a lengthy trial.   Detective Superintendent Mark Baker, the senior investigating officer in the case, said Cashman's actions were  abhorrent .  He said:  When he found out that he had shot an innocent young girl, he should have had the courage to stand up and come forward. Instead, he chose to lie low despite the fact that he was a dad himself.   He is not worthy of walking the streets of Merseyside, and neither are those who think they can bring fear or intimidation to our communities through use of firearms.

They said:  Although her life was short, her personality certainly wasn't and she lived it to the most she could, and would blow people away with her wit and kindness.   The senior investigating officer in the murder case has said the shooting of Olivia was a defining moment for a community that has had enough of organised crime.  Detective Superintendent Mark Baker said the murder of the nine-year-old had left the community  suffering , adding,  These people who use guns are toxic in our community, we need to stand firmly together to stamp it out.   It can now be reported that Paul Russell, 41, is to be sentenced for assisting an offender after he admitted driving Cashman away from Olivia's house following her murder, and disposing of his clothing.

Baroness Kate Hoey made the remarkable claim after an attempt by the DUP to block a key part of the revised Northern Ireland Protocol deal was heavily defeated in the Lords.  Peers rejected by 227 votes to 14 a motion to thwart regulations implementing the so-called Stormont brake, which enables politicians in Belfast to trigger a veto over new EU rules in the region.  Baroness Hoey - an ardent Brexit supporter and former Labour MP - argued politicians returning to Stormont under the  colony  of the EU would be like Nazi collaborators under the Vichy regime in wartime France.  The non-affiliated peer said:  There are people in Northern Ireland, leading politicians, who say, and it's true, that Northern Ireland has now become a form of colony. The EU's first kind of colony.    If Stormont goes back with the present Windsor Framework, they in fact would be almost like what happened during the war with the Vichy government, where all those MLAs [Members of the Legislative Assembly] would be collaborators with a kind of colonial government.   Baroness Hoey added:  Taking foreign laws from a foreign legislature, governing much of our economy in Northern Ireland and keeping us in a foreign customs code whereby GB, Great Britain, our country, where our capital is, becomes a third country, becomes our foreign country - it's just not acceptable.   It comes after the statutory instrument on the post-Brexit deal passed comfortably in the Commons last week - despite DUP opposition and a Tory backbench rebellion that included former prime ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.  The Stormont brake mechanism was a central plank of the Windsor Framework agreed between Rishi Sunak and the EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, designed to ease trading issues with the protocol.  The updated pact was formally signed off at a meeting in London last week, ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement peace deal.  Rishi Sunak and Ursula von der Leyen unveil post-Brexit Windsor Framework (PA Wire)  No 10 says the deal removes the Irish Sea trade border and strips out hundreds of pages of EU trade law, while the brake provided a  powerful new ongoing democratic safeguard .  But the DUP has refused to return to powersharing in Belfast, arguing the latest agreement still leaves Northern Ireland subject to rules from Brussels, and dismissed the Stormont brake as  convoluted  and ineffective.  DUP peer Lord McCrea said:  This brake couldn't stop a tricycle - never mind the EU juggernaut travelling down the track. I do not believe that my party could re-enter an assembly which would require us to work for the destruction of the union by implementing foreign laws in our own country.   Former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Baroness Ritchie argued the  greatest lack of democracy  in Northern Ireland was the absence of an assembly and executive and urged the DUP to return to Stormont.  Labour's former Northern Ireland secretary Lord Hain warned:  I do worry about the vacuum that has opened up because politics is not functioning. When politics doesn't function in Northern Ireland, then darker forces move in.   Tory frontbencher Lord Caine told the DUP that  we genuinely risk making the pursuit of the perfect the sworn enemy of the very good ."}, {"source": "google-news-it", "title": "Russia, il giornalista del Wall Street Journal arrestato stava lavorando a un'inchiesta sul gruppo Wagner - Il Sole 24 ORE", "text": "Ascolta la versione audio dell'articolo  3' di lettura  Evan Gershkovich, il giornalista del Wall Street Journal fermato a Ekaterinburg per spionaggio, rimarra in stato di arresto in Russia per almeno due mesi, fino al 29 maggio.

Oltre che a Ekaterinburg, il giornalista americano si era recato a Nizhny Tagil, un'altra citta russa dove e situato uno stabilimento dell'industria della difesa Uralvagonzavod, che produce carri armati. Lo scrive il sito indipendente Meduza citando  giornalisti occidentali che lavorano a Mosca .  Media locali della regione degli Urali citano un fixer, Yaroslav Shirshikov, che ha accompagnato il giornalista nella sua visita a Ekaterinburg. Secondo Shirshikov, Gershkovich si era recato in questa citta per raccogliere informazioni sull'atteggiamento della popolazione nei confronti del conflitto in Ucraina e la compagnia militare Wagner. Richiesto di un commento da un giornalista del Daily Beast, il fondatore della Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin, ha risposto in tono sarcastico: <<Se vuoi posso controllare la stanza delle torture di casa mia per vedere se e qui, ma non mi pare di averlo visto tra le decine di giornalisti americani che tengo li>>. Ieri, scrive Meduza, si era diffusa la voce che un uomo era stato fermato dalle forze di sicurezza nel ristorante Bukowski Grill di Ekaterinburg e portato via con la testa coperta da un maglione. Secondo Shirshikov si trattava proprio del giornalista americano.  Wsj: nessuno spionaggio    Il Wall Street Journal ha <<smentito con veemenza>> le accuse di spionaggio mosse da Mosca nei confronti del suo giornalista. <<Il Wall Street Journal respinge con veemenza le accuse deig servizi di sicurezza russi e chiede l'immediato rilascio di Evan Gershkovich, un giornalista affidabile e coscienzioso>>, ha dichiarato il giornale in un comunicato. <<Siamo solidali con Evan e la sua famiglia>>."}, {"source": "google-news-it", "title": "Bologna, ragazza Down e la Maturita negata: il Ministero sta con la scuola - il Resto del Carlino", "text": "Bologna, 30 marzo 2023 - I genitori di Nina Rosa Sorrentino, la ragazza con sindrome di Down che avrebbe voluto sostenere l'esame di Maturita al Liceo Sabin di Bologna, fanno sapere di aver appreso della comunicazione del ministero dalla stampa e si riservano di leggere il documento.  Il ministero dell'Istruzione ha sostanzialmente avvallato la posizione della scuola, ritenendo  congrua la decisione del Consiglio scolastico , come sottolineato dal capo dipartimento del ministero Carmela Palumbo ieri a La Vita in diretta.  Presenteranno ricorso?  Le vie legali sarebbero lunghe - spiega il papa di Nina, Alessandro - ci vorrebbe piu tempo di quanto ne abbiamo per trovare una soluzione per il futuro di nostra figlia .  Oggi pomeriggio, pero, i genitori hanno in programma una riunione con il gruppo di lavoro che li affianca da tre anni nella loro battaglia, tra cui l'associazione Coordown e il Ceps (Centro emiliano problemi sociali per la Trisomia 21) per valutare come proseguire.   Un obiettivo e stato centrato - sottolinea Alessandro Sorrentino - sono contento che il ministero abbia detto che questi casi sono motivo per future riflessioni politiche. Noi auspichiamo che dopo il clamore mediatico la politica rifletta davvero .  L'altro obiettivo invece al momento resta in sospeso:  Dobbiamo concentrarci su Nina, ora e casa da scuola e anche con le associazioni vogliamo lavorare a un progetto di scuola diffusa di quartiere per lei in questi mesi, perche mantenga la socialita e continui a studiare.

It improves my confidence and makes me feel better about myself ", "text": "In 2023, Buxton is proud to partner with Mind to support the sweat and tears of 15 Rise Up Runners. 15 real people, each facing their own physical and mental struggles, who are bravely taking on the ultimate test of resilience: The London Marathon. Their road to the race will be part of Buxton and Mind's wider mission to promote better physical and mental wellbeing across the nation, through exercise and hydration.  For Sha, unlearning childhood behaviours and finding community has led him to the resilient place he's in today, as he seeks to help others with their own mental health journeys.  Why are you running the London marathon?  I turn 50 this year, just two weeks before the marathon, and I think it would be an amazing thing for me to do when I'm 50. Also, I suffered with mental health issues from 2016 to 2018, so I want to be a part of this campaign to help make a difference in other people's lives by sharing my story.  What has shaped your mental health journey?  When I was 10 years old my dad had some mental health issues and he got sectioned for a few months. My parents emigrated from Pakistan in the 60s, and coming from an Asian background, I was told not to share this for fear of being treated differently or being embarrassed in the local community or within the family. This experience basically made me internalise any difficulties or problems I had from a young age. It affected my relationships with friends, family, authority figures, work colleagues, managers, girlfriends. However, after my mental health difficulties, once I realised what had been going on in my life, I felt like I'd broken free from these chains.  What has your mental health journey looked like?  In 1999 I started a career in digital marketing at the beginning of the dot com era. There was a lot of money being thrown around. I was working for a media agency and there were a lot of parties, drinking and unhealthy living. For five or six years I lived that life and then it dawned on me that I couldn't continue this unhealthy lifestyle. My friend said to me 'Let's start running.'  By 2015 I felt the fittest and strongest that I've ever felt and I really wanted to share what I'd learned. I took a year off work to look into wellbeing in the workplace and in 2016 I launched my company: The Wellness Movement . However, it was a big gamble and unfortunately things started to unravel as I started to realise how difficult it is to go into a new sector without any experience or credentials or contacts. I began to suffer from anxiety and stress and I'd sit in front of the laptop and freeze. I started to get paranoid and I'd wile away the hours in bed all day. This went on for two years. I'd heard people talk about having dark clouds and I never knew what that meant until it happened to me. I had dark thoughts in my head and I didn't feel like myself.  What led you out of the dark moments?  One day I had a meeting with a breathing coach and he asked me a very simple question. He asked me what the word happiness means to me. And it was in that moment that the penny dropped and I was like 'I can't answer that question. I'm not happy.' That was the catalyst for me. I sat on the train on the way home and started crying but it was like a cry of relief. I knew something was wrong. I went to see my mum and I told her. At first she had a go at me but then she hugged me and apologised. In our family no one ever shares their problems - it's always about putting on a brave face. That's just how it was. But I felt a big relief when I shared with my mum and the dark clouds started to separate and the sunshine started to come back into my life slowly.  How important is communication for your mental health?  It's so important to reflect on how you're feeling and to talk about it. I think now the new generation are much more open to things like therapy. People are a lot more vocal about how they feel whereas my generation didn't share anything because there was a massive stigma. I was part of a running community so I went and spoke to a few friends about what I'd been going through, and the more I spoke about it the better I felt. I started feeling like myself again.  Do you believe community is helpful in terms of mental wellbeing?  100 per cent. A community is a place where you feel you can be your authentic self without fear of judgement of criticism. A place where everyone is treated the same regardless of background, sexuality, race, age, anything. A place where you feel confident and where you can support others as well as people supporting you. Having that helps us feel like we belong to something that's bigger than ourselves. The safer the place you feel you're in, the more you can be yourself.  What did running do for you?  Running was my salvation. When I started struggling with my mental health, running became massive. It became an escape for me. It gave me so much and it still does to this day. That's why I created Be More You - I wanted to give back and make a difference to runners' lives. For me, running definitely improves my confidence and makes me feel better about myself. It really supports my mental health. It's my therapy.  What advice would you give to others struggling with dark periods of mental health?  You are allowed to ask for help. It's not something you have to struggle with yourself. And there is lots of help out there. By sharing how you're feeling, you can release yourself from the prison of your own mind.

Incluso (in parte) il nucleare - Open", "text": "Da Bruxelles - Dopo quindici ore di negoziati, l'accordo e arrivato. Questa mattina, il Consiglio e il Parlamento europeo hanno raggiunto l'intesa per rivedere (al rialzo) gli obiettivi della direttiva rinnovabili. La novita principale riguarda il target al 2030: entro quella data i 27 Paesi membri dovranno generare almeno il 42,5% dell'energia elettrica da fonti rinnovabili. Una quota che cresce non solo rispetto all'attuale obiettivo del 32% (fissato nel 2018) ma anche rispetto al 40% proposto dall'esecutivo Ue nel 2021, in occasione della presentazione del pacchetto clima. L'accordo raggiunto oggi sembra aver lasciato tutti soddisfatti: dalla presidente della parlamento Roberta Metsola alla commissaria all'Energia Kadri Simson, che parla di <<compromesso ambizioso>>. Perche i nuovi obiettivi diventino effettivamente vincolanti, l'intesa dovra essere ratificata dal Consiglio Ue e dal Parlamento. Anche se lo scoglio piu difficile, ossia il raggiungimento di un'intesa su alcuni punti delicati della direttiva, sembra essere ormai superato.  Il ruolo di nucleare e biomasse  OPEN | La conferenza stampa di Markus Pieper, membro della commissione Industria del Parlamento Europeo  I due punti piu ostici dell'accordo riguardano biomasse e nucleare. Per le prime, l'accordo raggiunto oggi a Bruxelles prevede un inasprimento dei criteri di sostenibilita ambientale. L'energia da biomassa, insomma, continua a essere considerata green, a patto che sia prodotta seguendo i criteri stabiliti da Bruxelles. Discorso diverso per il nucleare, che in piu occasioni ha fatto litigare le istituzioni europee e i governi dei Paesi membri. Il pressing della Francia per includere questa tipologia di energia nell'ambito delle rinnovabili alla fine ha avuto un successo parziale. Secondo Pascal Canfin, presidente della commissione Ambiente del Parlamento europeo, la nuova direttiva rinnovabili riconosce il <<ruolo specifico del nucleare, che non e ne verde ne fossile>>. L'idrogeno prodotto da energia atomico e stato incluso nel progetto di direttiva e potra dunque essere conteggiato nel piano di decarbonizzazione dell'industria, ma con <<forti limiti>>, ha precisato l'eurodeputato tedesco Markus Pieper che guida i negoziati inter-istituzionali, citato dall'Ansa. L'accordo raggiunto oggi dalle diverse istituzioni europee sulla direttiva rinnovabili chiude di fatto la fase dei negoziati sui principali testi del Fit for 55, il pacchetto di misure a favore del clima che hanno l'obiettivo di ridurre le emissioni di CO2 del 55% (rispetto ai livelli degli anni Novanta) entro il 2030. <<In 18 mesi abbiamo creato regole senza precedenti al mondo per darci i mezzi per vincere la battaglia per il clima>>, ha esultato Canfin.  Cosa prevede l'accordo  Per rendere attuabili i nuovi obiettivi europei, il Trilogo punta soprattutto su una strada: l'accelerazione dei permessi per gli impianti a energia rinnovabile. Gli Stati membri potranno individuare delle aree del proprio territorio dove gli iter burocratici e autorizzativi potranno procedere in via semplificata. Non solo: l'installazione di nuovi impianti avra sempre un <<interesse pubblico prevalente>>. In altre parole, Bruxelles prova a limitare le basi legali di quei gruppi che si oppongono alle nuove installazioni di rinnovabili. L'intesa raggiunta oggi a Bruxelles prevede una serie di criteri vincolanti per due ambiti in particolari: gli edifici e i trasporti. Per quanto riguarda i primi, entro il 2030 il 49% dell'energia totale consumata dovra provenire da fonti rinnovabili. Al settore dei trasporti invece e stata data una doppia opzione: un obiettivo di almeno il 29% di quota di rinnovabili nel consumo finale di energia entro il 2030 oppure una riduzione del 14,5% delle emissioni di gas serra. Questo secondo obiettivo dovrebbe essere raggiunto sia tramite le rinnovabili che con l'uso di carburanti sintetici e biocarburanti, che dovranno contribuire almeno per il 5,5% del totale.

Attorno alle 13:45 di giovedi 30 marzo il leader di Forza Italia ha lasciato il San Raffaele di Milano dove era ricoverato da lunedi 27 per alcuni controlli di routine.  Silvio Berlusconi dimesso dal San Raffaele  Berlusconi e andato via senza rilasciare dichiarazioni ai cronisti in attesa e limitandosi ad accennare un saluto con la mano. Con lui la compagna, nonche deputata di Forza Italia, Marta Fascina.  Nel pomeriggio di mercoledi 29 marzo il Cavaliere aveva ricevuto la visita del figlio minore Luigi.  Fonte foto: ANSA Nella foto, Luigi Berlusconi si reca all'ospedale San Raffaele in visita al padre ricoverato.  L'ex premier sarebbe in buone condizioni di salute. I controlli ai quali si e sottoposto sarebbero stati solo accertamenti di routine.  Per il legale nessun ricovero strumentale  Come riporta 'La Stampa', l'avvocato Federico Cecconi, legale di Berlusconi, smentisce le voci secondo le quali il ricovero del suo assistito sarebbe stato strumentale per non presenziare in aula nel processo 'Escort' di Bari.  Processo in cui Berlusconi e accusato di 'induzione a rendere false dichiarazioni all'autorita giudiziaria'.  Il processo Ruby Ter si e invece concluso a febbraio con l'assoluzione dell'ex premier.  I ricoveri e le operazioni di Silvio Berlusconi  Il piu recente ricovero di Silvio Berlusconi risale al gennaio del 2022. Quel ricovero coincise con le elezioni del Capo dello Stato che portarono alla riconferma di Sergio Mattarella. In quell'occasione al Cavaliere fu curata un'infezione alle vie urinarie.  Negli ultimi anni Silvio Berlusconi si e sottoposto a una serie di accertamenti medici e operazioni.  A settembre 2020 ha affrontato il Covid-19: l'infezione gli aveva provocato una polmonite.  Nel 2019 il leader di Forza Italia e stato operato per rimuovere un'occlusione intestinale.  Nel 2016 e stata la volta di un'operazione al cuore.  Nel novembre 2014 fu ricoverato al San Raffaele per via di un'uveite, un'infiammazione alla membrana fra la cornea e la sclera.  Nel 2010, dopo aver a lungo e inutilmente portato un tutore alla mano, i medici consigliarono a Berlusconi di operarsi per risolvere una tendinite che non passava.  L'anno prima, nel dicembre 2009, Silvio Berlusconi fu colpito al volto da una statuetta del Duomo di Milano lanciata dall'allora 42enne Massimo tartaglia. L'esito dell'aggressione fu un trauma facciale curabile in 20 giorni.  Nel novembre del 2006 a Montecatini Terme, durante l'intervento conclusivo della kermesse dei Circoli della liberta, Berlusconi ebbe un collasso e fini per svenire. Si riprese poco dopo e rifiuto il trasferimento in ospedale a bordo di un'ambulanza.

Ovviamente non e un fenomeno nuovo, ma si verifica puntualmente quando i prezzi del capoluogo sono in crescita. L'opportunita della scelta dipende da molti fattori: ad esempio la distanza dal capoluogo e un elemento fondamentale se si lavora in citta e se per raggiungerla bisogna usare mezzi propri (a quel punto il costo del carburante e dell'usura auto rischia di mangiarsi tutto il risparmio sulla rata del mutuo), un altro se si puo lavorare da casa on line. Un altro esempio puo essere quello di chi ha figli che devono frequentare le scuole superiori e che valutano di trasferirsi in un comune dove non ce ne sono. E via dicendo.  I Comuni piu economici Prescindendo da queste considerazioni e concentrandoci solo sul fattore economico, uno studio effettuato da Insights, business unit specializzata in analisi di mercato di immobiliare.it identifica i dieci Comuni della provincia a distanza di 30/40 minuti dal centro del capoluogo (una tempistica calcolata in qualche caso con molto ottimismo) dove e possibile comprare un trilocale con un sostanziale risparmio di prezzo e di rata di mutuo rispetto a Milano. Il costo base dell'immobile milanese e fissato dal confronto a 450 mila euro, ma per completezza di informazione dobbiamo sottolineare che anche oggi in periferia si trovano appartamenti a molto meno di quella cifra. Il Comune piu economico risulta essere Abbiategrasso, dove un trilocale costa in media 150 mila euro. Con 160 mila euro si trova a Lodi e con 180 mila a Pioltello, la prima ha tutti i servizi tipici di un capoluogo di provincia, e, come Pioltello, e servita molto bene dal treno. Sotto i 190 mila euro si trovano Saronno (servitissima con la Nord Cadorna, Garibaldi, Centrale e Passante) e Cinisello Balsamo.  Per chi puo spingersi a 200 mila euro In realta, in entrambi questi Comuni il nuovo costa piu o meno come il nuovo nella periferia meno servita di Milano. Sotto i 200 mila euro si pongono Rho, Lissone e Seregno, mentre appena sopra, a 203 mila euro, Cologno Monzese e Cesano Maderno. Che cosa significano questi prezzi in termini di rata del mutuo? Ipotizzando un finanziamento a 30 anni pari all'80% del prezzo si parte per Abbiategrasso per arrivare a 969 a Cesano Maderno. La rata per la casa tipo da 450 mila euro a Milano sarebbe di 1933 euro.

Cosi il Tribunale di Sorveglianza di Milano, presieduto da Giovanna Di Rosa, ha motivato il no alla concessione del differimento pena con detenzione domiciliare per il piu noto esponente del banditismo.  Nel provvedimento, in pratica, si chiarisce che l'opposizione a cure e diagnosi da parte del detenuto non consente di interrompere l'esecuzione della pena per motivi di salute, proprio perche manca un accertamento preciso sulla malattia. Nella sentenza (giudice estensore Giovanni Gerosa e a latere Laura De Gregorio), depositata ai primi di marzo, i magistrati, infatti, spiegano che Mesina, detenuto nel carcere milanese dallo scorso giugno, si pone  in maniera oppositiva  di fronte alle cure e ai tentativi da parte del personale medico, a cui non offre alcuna collaborazione, di arrivare ad una diagnosi. E le sue condizioni, per quanto possibile, vengono valutate come  apparentemente  discrete.  Con questa decisione, presa in un procedimento aperto d'ufficio da parte dei giudici e senza un'istanza difensiva, i magistrati milanesi, sulla base della giurisprudenza, mettono nero su bianco che quando non si puo approfondire il  quadro diagnostico  di fronte al rifiuto del detenuto, non si puo dare l'ok a quel punto al differimento pena. Un profilo giuridico, tra l'altro, molto simile e in linea con quello che nei giorni scorsi ha portato la Sorveglianza milanese a respingere la richiesta di differimento pena con detenzione domiciliare avanzata dall'anarchico Alfredo Cospito: in questo caso sul punto della  autoinduzione  in uno stato critico, attraverso un consapevole sciopero della fame, che il 55enne porta avanti contro il 41bis. Mesina, evaso piu volte (l'ultima nel 2020) e con fine pena previsto nel dicembre 2045, si legge ancora negli atti, ha deciso di  autodimettersi  dalle cure ai primi di dicembre scorso.  Da quel momento per i medici del carcere non e stato piu possibile fare esami approfonditi sul suo stato di salute. Per lui, tra l'altro, nei giorni scorsi il Tribunale di Sorveglianza di Sassari (prima era detenuto in Sardegna) ha rigettato l'istanza di detenzione domiciliare avanzata stavolta dai suoi difensori, secondo i quali l'ex latitante sta male a causa dell'avanzare dell'eta e della vita troppo sedentaria."}, {"source": "google-news-it", "title": "Papa Francesco, notte tranquilla al Gemelli. Il Vaticano ha pronto il  piano B  per i riti della... - Il Fatto Quotidiano", "text": "Papa Francesco ha trascorso tranquillamente la prima notte al Policlinico Gemelli di Roma nella stanza al decimo piano riservata ai pontefici. Il ricovero urgente si e reso necessario a causa di un improvviso affaticamento respiratorio verificatosi mercoledi pomeriggio, 29 marzo, subito dopo pranzo. Bergoglio si trovava nel suo appartamento, la stanza 201 al secondo piano di Casa Santa Marta, quando e avvenuto il malore che ha fatto scattare immediatamente il ricovero al Gemelli dove e arrivato in ambulanza. L'esito degli accertamenti, come ha precisato il direttore della Sala Stampa della Santa Sede, Matteo Bruni, ha evidenziato un'infezione respiratoria (esclusa l'infezione da Covid 19) che richiedera alcuni giorni di opportuna terapia medica ospedaliera . La tac toracica ha dato esito negativo, confermando la diagnosi ipotizzata al momento del ricovero: bronchite cronica con asma, scatenata probabilmente dallo stress.  Le udienze in programma oggi e venerdi sono state immediatamente cancellate, ma si prevede un ricovero piuttosto lungo per un paziente che ha 86 anni e che, nel 1957, quando aveva 21 anni, ha subito l'asportazione del lobo superiore del polmone destro a causa di tre cisti. Precedentemente, Francesco aveva rivelato:  Non ho mai provato affaticamento o mancanza di respiro (dispnea). Come mi hanno spiegato i medici, il polmone destro si e espanso e ha coperto tutto l'emitorace omolaterale . Al Gemelli il Papa e stato subito sottoposto a una terapia antibiotica che durera alcuni giorni. In Vaticano e, dunque, stato velocemente approntato il piano B per tutte le celebrazioni della settimana santa, prevedibilmente senza la presenza di Francesco. Il maestro delle celebrazioni liturgiche pontificie, monsignor Diego Ravelli, ha individuato diversi porporati che sostituiranno il Papa nelle numerose liturgie in programma. Il cardinale Leonardo Sandri, prefetto emerito del Dicastero per le Chiese orientali e sottodecano del Collegio cardinalizio, celebrera la messa della Domenica delle palme, il 2 aprile, in piazza San Pietro.  Quanto anticipato da ilfattoquotidiano.it giovedi mattina e stato poi confermato nelle ore successive dal cardinale Giovanni Battista Re, prefetto emerito del Dicastero per i vescovi e decano del Collegio cardinalizio:  Abbiamo distribuito le varie celebrazioni: la domenica delle palme celebrera il sottodecano, il cardinale Leonardo Sandri. Il giovedi santo, al mattino, per la messa crismale ci sara il vicario di Roma, cioe il cardinale Angelo De Donatis . La messa in Coena Domini, invece, che si celebra il pomeriggio del giovedi santo, non sara una celebrazione papale perche Francesco, come sua abitudine, l'avrebbe celebrata fuori dal Vaticano, solitamente in un carcere. Quindi il Papa non sara sostituito da nessuno e le messe a San Pietro e a San Giovanni in Laterano saranno regolarmente celebrate dai rispettivi arcipreti, i cardinali Mauro Gambetti e De Donatis.  Esattamente come sarebbe avvenuto se il Papa avesse celebrato la messa che ricorda l'ultima cena di Gesu in una  periferia esistenziale , tradizione che Bergoglio ha continuato a Roma dopo l'elezione al pontificato, mantenendo una consuetudine che aveva da arcivescovo di Buenos Aires. Ancora da stabilire, invece, i porporati che presiederanno l'azione liturgica del venerdi santo a San Pietro e la via crucis in mondovisione al Colosseo.  Vedremo - ha aggiunto Re - perche alcune cose non sono ancora state determinate. Alla veglia pasquale, sabato santo, ci sara uno dei cardinali, ma si deve ancora stabilire. Io celebrero la messa di Pasqua in piazza San Pietro . Intanto, in Vaticano si sta valutando se e come il Papa recitera l'Angelus domenica prossima, 2 aprile, e l'Urbi et Orbi di Pasqua, il 9 aprile. Dovrebbe essere ufficializzato anche l'annullamento dell'udienza generale in programma mercoledi 5 aprile in piazza San Pietro.  E la seconda volta che Bergoglio e ricoverato al Gemelli. Qui, il 4 luglio 2021, Francesco fu operato al colon e la degenza duro dieci giorni.  L'esame istologico definitivo - preciso all'epoca il Vaticano - ha confermato una stenosi diverticolare severa con segni di diverticolite sclerosante . Francesco non ama parlare della sua salute. A chi gli chiede come sta risponde sempre:  Ancora vivo . Un modo divertente per dribblare la domanda. Da un anno il Papa usa spesso la sedia a rotelle a causa delle difficolta a camminare per una lesione al legamento del ginocchio destro. Ieri mattina, in piazza San Pietro per la consueta udienza generale del mercoledi, Bergoglio non si e risparmiato, restando all'aperto diverse ore per salutare i numerosi fedeli presenti nonostante il freddo pungente. Poi il malore a Casa Santa Marta e il ricovero al Gemelli.

New Alienware Aurora R13 Intel Core i7-12700 Alder Lake RTX 3060 Ti Gaming PC for $1699.99  This particular config comes equipped with a new 12th gen Intel Core i7-12700F Alder-Lake 12-core processor, 16GB of DDR5-4400MHz RAM, a generously sized 1TB SSD, and the RTX 3060 Ti GPU. The RTX 3060 Ti is about as powerful as the previous generation's RTX 2080 SUPER; it's more than powerful enough to handle any game at up to 1440p.  The latest Intel Core i7 Alder Lake CPU is currently the king of gaming processors; it is significantly more powerful than any of the previous Intel CPUs before it. It's also much faster than the newest AMD Ryzen 6000 series processors. One of the disadvantages of jumping on the Intel Alder Lake platform is that you will need a new motherboard and RAM. Fortunately, if you go the prebuilt route, all of that is taken care of for you. The Dell XPS boasts an Intel Z960 chipset motherboard that supports the Alder Lake CPU as well as PCI-E 5.0 for your RTX 30 series video card and beyond, plus you get 16GB of the new DDR5-4400MHz RAM.

This is the newest Dell XPS chassis. Compared to the previous iteration, the XPS 8950 is larger in volume (27L vs 19L) and provides more clearance for the CPU and GPU area for much better airflow. That's important because the new 12th generation Alder Lake processors as well as the RTX 30 series video card can run hot.

According to Deadline, the 67-year-old actor, who has appeared in the Harry Potter franchise as well as Paddington 2 and In Bruges, will join the upcoming DC supervillain movie.  Unfortunately, details about Gleeson's role remain firmly under wraps, but we do know that he'll be joining an all-star cast including Joaquin Phoenix, Lady Gaga, and Zazie Beetz.  Loading Play  Joker was released in 2019 and saw Phoenix in the role of Batman's most iconic villain, the Joker.  An origin movie of sorts, Joker told the story of Arthur Fleck - an unstable clown-for-hire who finds himself dissatisfied with the hand he's dealt... and goes to murderous lengths to get what he wants.  Obviously, the alternate-universe stylings of the first movie meant that DC comic book characters were few and far between... so, it's difficult to predict what role Gleeson might have in the sequel.  The first film was a huge success both critically and at the box office, earning a massive $1.07 billion at the worldwide box office and becoming the first R-rated movie to top $1 billion.  IGN's review gave it 10/10 and said:  Joker isn't just an awesome comic book movie, it's an awesome movie, period. It offers no easy answers to the unsettling questions it raises about a cruel society in decline. Joaquin Phoenix's fully committed performance and Todd Phillips' masterful albeit loose reinvention of the DC source material make Joker a film that should leave comic book fans and non-fans alike disturbed and moved in all the right ways.   Best Joker Comics to Read After Watching the Movie 8 Images  The upcoming sequel will see Joker direct Todd Phillips return to the helm. He also co-wrote the script alongside Scott Silver, who penned the first film.  Although not much is known about Joker 2, some insiders have said that it could be a musical and will also be set within the legendary Arkham Asylum - not a bad bet since that's where we last saw Arthur Fleck.  But for now, we'll have to wait and see.  Want to read more about Joker 2? Check out the Joker: Folie a Deux teaser trailer and delve into what the film's title could tell us about its plot.

Aveva criticato il nuovo Codice - ilmessaggero.it", "text": "<<Gravi, inqualificabili e disinformate dichiarazioni del presidente Busia sul Codice Salvini: se parla cosi di migliaia di sindaci e pensa che siano tutti corrotti, non puo stare piu in quel ruolo. Busia ha dei compiti di controllo, invece certifica di essere prevenuto, non neutrale e quindi non credibile>>. Cosi Stefano Locatelli, responsabile Enti Locali della Lega, dopo le parole del presidente dell'Autorita nazionale anticorruzione Giuseppe Busia.  I deputati della Lega in commissione Ambiente - Gianpiero Zinzi, Alessandro Benvenuto, Gianangelo Bof, Elisa Montemagni e Graziano Pizzimenti - dichiarano: <<La Lega ha piena fiducia negli amministratori locali, a differenza del presidente di Anac che li considera evidentemente corrotti e corruttibili. Busia prima di sparare a zero sui sindaci e sul Codice Salvini dovrebbe ragionare su quale sia il futuro che vuole per l'Italia. Noi vogliamo efficienza e sburocratizzazione per un Paese veloce, non ci sono dubbi>>.  Appalti, cosa ha detto Busia  Ieri Busia, intervenendo su Radio Uno, ha affermato che la principale  luce  del nuovo Codice degli appalti e la digitalizzazione, <<che obbliga a trasparenza e partecipazione>>, ma la principale  ombra  e che <<invece sotto i 150.000 euro si da mano libera, si dice non consultate il mercato, scegliete l'impresa che volete, il che vuol dire che si prendera l'impresa piu vicina, quella che conosco, non quella che si comporta meglio>>.  <<Sotto i 150.000 euro va benissimo il cugino o anche chi mi ha votato e questo e un problema, soprattutto nei piccoli centri>>, ha spiegato ai microfoni di Radio Uno.  <<Bene l'impulso alla digitalizzazione degli appalti del nuovo Codice. Attenzione, pero, a spostare l'attenzione solo sul  fare in fretta , che non puo mai perdere di vista il  fare bene . - dichiara Busia in una nota diffusa dopo il suo intervento su Radio Uno - Semplificazione e rapidita sono valori importanti, ma non possono andare a discapito di principi altrettanto importanti come trasparenza, controllabilita e libera concorrenza, che nel nuovo Codice non hanno trovato tutta l'attenzione necessaria, specie in una fase del Paese in cui stanno affluendo ingenti risorse europee>>.  Busia sottolinea anche gli aspetti positivi del nuovo Codice. <<Con la gestione interamente digitale degli appalti, prevista dal Codice e impegno di Anac da tempo, sara garantita l'estensione del digitale a tutto il ciclo di vita del contratto, a partire dalla programmazione, alla richiesta del codice identificativo di gara, fino all'esecuzione e conclusione del contratto, e all'ultima fattura. Questo porta a piena maturazione quanto Anac ha gia fatto con la Banca dati nazionale dei contratti pubblici: tutte le informazioni e le attivita riguardanti l'appalto dovranno passare attraverso piattaforme telematiche interoperabili e confluiscono sul portale dell'Autorita, con l'acquisizione diretta dei dati>>.  Restano pero i dubbi, <<per la riduzione della trasparenza e della pubblicita delle procedure, principi posti a garanzia di una migliore partecipazione delle imprese, e a tutela dei diritti di tutti i soggetti coinvolti>>. <<Soglie troppo elevate - afferma Busia - per gli affidamenti diretti e le procedure negoziate rendono meno contendibili e meno controllabili gli appalti di minori dimensioni, che sono - va notato - quelli numericamente piu significativi. Tutto questo col rischio di ridurre concorrenza e trasparenza nei contratti pubblici>>.  Tra gli aspetti positivi del Codice, Busia sottolinea invece il rafforzamento della <<vigilanza collaborativa, uno dei piu efficaci strumenti di prevenzione che consente ad Anac di intervenire con tempestivita e garanzia della legalita nelle procedure di aggiudicazione, senza nessuna perdita di tempo. Le Pubbliche amministrazioni che vi aderiscono sottopongono in via preventiva gli atti di gara all'Autorita, che in tempi brevissimi - dai 5 agli 8 giorni - fornisce osservazioni e consigli, favorendo la deflazione del contenzioso>>.  <<Un altro elemento positivo e il ruolo accresciuto di Anac di ausilio e sostegno alle stazioni appaltanti con la creazione di bandi tipo, documenti tipo, atti gia pronti, che le amministrazioni possano usare. Si tratta di una forma di collaborazione e di promozione di buone pratiche, nello spirito di risoluzione dei problemi. Cosi l'azione dell'Autorita viene rafforzata per favorire la ripresa, affiancando le amministrazioni sul versante dei contratti, per renderli strumenti efficaci di realizzazione dei tanti progetti messi in campo, garantendo apertura, concorrenza e capacita di selezionare le imprese piu idonee, dinamiche e innovative, al servizio dell'interesse pubblico. Attraverso i contratti-tipo, per esempio, e le nostre piattaforme informatiche, verra monitorato il rispetto dei contratti collettivi di lavoro, evitando l'adozione dei cosiddetti 'contratti pirata, a garanzia dei lavoratori>>."}, {"source": "ign", "title": "Daily Deals: Save $50 Off the Microsoft Xbox Series X Gaming Console + Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller Bundle - IGN", "text": "Check out the new hot daily deals for today, including a rare discount on an Xbox Series X gaming console bundle, $170 off the Apple AirPods Max headphones, $50 off the Bose SoundLik II portable Bluetooth speaker, $500 off the new 2022 Hisense U8H 4K Micro-LED TV with HDMI 2.1, $300 off the Arcade1Up The Simpsons cabinet, and more.

That's right, this particular ASUS TUF Dash 15  gaming laptop was priced at $1100 on Black Friday, but it's only $999.99 today. It features an RTX 3060 GPU with 105W max TGP and the newest generation Intel Core i7-12650H Alder Lake processor. The new Alder Lake processors are a significant performance bump over previous gen Intel CPUs. Complementing these specs are 16GB of DDR5 RAM and a 512GB SSD.  Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 GPU for $739.99  The Gigabyte GeForce RTX 3080 GPU is the least expensive RTX 3080 variant on Amazon right now at a solid price of $739.99. The RTX 3080 really doesn't need any introduction. This is the de facto card to get if you plan to run current generation games at 4K, since it's up to 50% faster than the previous generation RTX 2080 SUPER and doesn't command the exorbitant price of the RTX 3080 Ti or RTX 3090 (both of which are a mere 3%-5% faster in real world performance). It has an HDMI 2.1 port for passing through 4K @ 120Hz, which it has the power to drive even with resource hungry games like Elden Ring.

Although the RTX 3090 is indeed a best-in-class gaming card (it's as much as 20% more powerful than the RTX 3080 at 4K resolution), it's actually not really intended for gamers. The RTX 3090 is the workstation GPU of choice not because of its processing power (which it has in spades), but because of the massive 24GB of GDDR6X RAM.

Em 2022, a companhia consolidou nove ativos novos em seu balanco.  Sob este contexto, prossegue o executivo, a companhia de tratamento e valorizacao de residuos tem um desafio de mostrar ao mercado o real desempenho operacional.  Atualmente, os numeros contabeis estao descolado do operacional, mas, a partir de agora, entendemos que os numeros vao convergir , explica Pilao Junior, ao InfoMoney.  Pelo desempenho de tela, os investidores acompanharam a tese. A acao da Orizon fechou com alta de 2,52% nesta quinta-feira (30), a R$ 36,51.  A primeira linha do balanco exemplifica o momento da companhia. No quarto trimestre, a Orizon registrou receita liquida de R$ 179,2 milhoes, alta de 15,3% sobre igual periodo de 2021. No entanto, por conta de uma mudanca de metodologia que a empresa esta empregando para comercializar carbono, cerca de R$ 27,7 milhoes de faturamento nao puderam entrar na peca.  No ano, o desempenho chegou a R$ 626,2 milhoes - sem contar o ganho do carbono - desempenho recorde para a Orizon.  Para o Credit Suisse, os numeros da Orizon vieram mais fracos que o esperado por ela e pelo consenso do mercado. O ponto principal foi uma entrega pior nos precos medios que o previsto nos aterros sanitarios.   Em uma base anual, os resultados refletiram a incorporacao de novos ativos e foram afetados pela falta de venda de creditos de carbono, apesar da maior producao , escreveu o banco, que tem recomendacao de compra para o papel.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Tambem registrou recorde o lucro antes de juros, impostos, depreciacao e amortizacao (Ebitda), que alcancou R$ 79,1 milhoes, com alta de 3% sobre o 4T21. No ano, o Ebitda contabil somou R$ 226,3 milhoes, com alta de 70%.  Com ajustes de receitas nao recorrentes, o indice ficou em R$ 64,4 milhoes no 4T22, uma queda de 16% em relacao ao 4T21. Caso os creditos de carbono, ajuste de depreciacao e prejuizos em ativos pudessem entrar na conta, o Ebitda poderia ter somado R$ 101,8 milhoes.  Lucros Alem da Bolsa Masterclass Gratuita Como ter o potencial de ganhar mais do que a Renda Fixa sem depender dos animos do mercado e das oscilacoes da Bolsa   Na nossa avaliacao, nosso Ebitda 'running' e este. Se levarmos em conta que temos previsibilidade de receita, estamos falando de um Ebtida anualizado de mais de R$ 400 milhoes , aponta o CEO da Orizon, Milton Pilao Junior.  Resultado liquido e alavancagem  A ultima linha do balanco apresenta um prejuizo liquido de R$ 55,8 milhoes no 4T22, ampliando em 271% o resultado negativo de um ano antes (R$ 15 milhoes). Em todo o ano passado, o prejuizo liquido foi de R$ 115,1 milhoes, alta de 107% sobre 2021, quando o desempenho ficou negativo em R$ 55,5 milhoes.  Em sintese, empresa explicou o resultado ao mercado por ter sido  impactado principalmente: (a) pela ausencia de receita de creditos de carbono (R$ 93,8 milhoes), (b) efeito de despesas financeiras sem efeito caixa (R$ 33,9 milhoes), (c) juros de emprestimos que foram utilizados para suportar as recentes aquisicoes e projetos greenfields, que trarao geracao de caixa significativa no futuro; e (d) performance negativa de ativos em ramp-up .  No entanto, o CEO da Orizon reforca que o prejuizo nao teve efeito caixa. Segundo Pilao Junior, o pagamento da compra de um ativo com a troca de acao, por exemplo, impactou o caixa em cerca de R$ 30 milhoes - isso porque a acao se valorizou entre a celebracao do acordo e o closing.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   Apesar do crescimento de volume em todas as linhas de negocio, que diluiu os custos fixos, a margem bruta diminuiu ligeiramente de 41% para 38% ano contra ano devido a entrada de ativos adquiridos com margens mais baixas , avaliou a XP, que considera o resultado 'neutro'. A empresa tambem recomenda a compra da acao.  Nos calculos da Orizon, levando em conta a questao do carbono, a relacao divida liquida por Ebitda esta rodando em 2,7 vezes, abaixo do nivel de 3 vezes considerado o saudavel pela companhia. O endividamento liquido da companhia soma R$ 842,3 milhoes.  Ao nao se levar em conta todo ajuste contabil, a alavancagem encerrou 2022 rodando a 3,72 vezes.  Isso no nosso pior momento de alavancagem, sem a maturacao de nossos ativos e nem a receita do carbono , reforca o CEO da Orizon.  O BTG destacou que os numeros apresentados pela Orizon sao considerados solidos e tambem recomenda compra do papel. Na avaliacao do banco, a empresa ainda tem espaco para novas aquisicoes e fusoes neste ano, diante da alta fragmentacao no setor que gere residuos. Mesma avaliacao faz o Credit Suisse.  M&As oportunisticos  Neste sentido, Milton Pilao Junior destaca que a companhia segue de olho em novas aquisicoes, mas elas serao  oportunisticas . Na pratica, a empresa olhara a formatacao do projeto e buscara ativos que oferecam menor uso do caixa. A expectativa e de que ate cinco aquisicoes poderiam ser feitas nesta logica.  Por fim, o CEO destaca que a Orizon entrou em 2023 capitalizada por uma emissao de R$ 400 milhoes em debentures, em que R$ 210,8 milhoes foram destinados a antecipacao de dividas e o restante sera utilizado para financiar a expansao da companhia."}, {"source": "info-money", "title": "Ibovespa abre em alta e supera os 103 mil pontos, com novo arcabouco fiscal e a espera de Campos Neto; Petrobras (PETR4) e Vale (VALE3) sobem", "text": "update 7h00  Os indices futuros dos EUA e bolsas da Europa operam com alta, dando continuidade ao movimento de recuperacao das ultimas sessoes, a medida que as preocupacoes com o setor bancario diminuem.

For those with Netflix, there is quite a selection of great action movies to pick from. This includes both the streamer's original films and a collection of hidden gems and action classics. Here is the cream of the butt-kicking crop.  The Best Action Movies on Netflix Right Now 16 Images  Top Gun (1986)  Top Gun: Maverick took the world by storm - it's a critical and commercial success, and is even the front runner for Best Picture at this year's Academy Awards! So if you're curious to see what all the fuss is about, and what made it possible, the original Top Gun is available for your viewing pleasure. The film is pure '80s glory: a high concept pitch, an all star cast, and a friendship that may or may not be laced with homoerotic subtext. In this case, it's the rivalry/friendship between Tom Cruise's Maverick and Val Kilmer's Iceman...which lends itself well to a pivotal scene in Maverick.  Director: Tony Scott  Tony Scott Starring: Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis  Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer, Kelly McGillis Runtime: 110 minutes  Minority Report (2002)  Why stop at Top Gun? Make it a Cruise double feature with Minority Report. Based (as most groundbreaking sci-fi films are) on a Phillip K. Dick story, Minority Report finds Cruise's Ethan Anderton tracking down and stopping crimes before they happen as part of a  pre-crime  unit. Yet when he finds himself in the crosshairs, he goes on the run. This is one of Steven Spielberg's best efforts to date, as he shows he can still stage a crackerjack action sequence while also maintaining the steady pace of a sci-fi thriller. Anderton's escape from the Pre-Crime division is worth the watch.

Uncharted falls toward the former, thanks to Tom Holland. Holland brings his boyish charm and a bit of grit to the role of treasure hunter Nathan Drake, and is undoubtedly the strongest link in the partnership between himself and Mark Wahlberg's Victor Sullivan. Add in a delightfully unhinged Antonio Banderas and a few inventive setpieces including a fight against gravity itself, and this is one game you won't want to be over.

Who can forget the first time they saw Blade take out a nightclub full of vampires, or Buffy Summers staking the undead on a weekly basis? Day Shift puts a new spin on the subgenre, painting vampire hunting as a job - and Jamie Foxx's Bud Jablonski is less concerned with saving the world than he is with making rent and getting his daughter the braces she needs.  Director JJ Perry brings his stunt experience from the John Wick and Fast & Furious films to his first ever film, resulting in some insanely inventive action sequences - a battle in a bowling alley has just the right amount of absurdity and bloodshed. Add in Dave Franco as a neurotic bureaucrat and Snoop Dogg as a vampire hunter (yes really) and you have a recipe for a great time.  Director: J. J. Perry  J. J.

Now they've turned to the espionage genre with The Gray Man. Based on the novel by Mark Greaney, it follows Court Gentry/Sierra Six (Ryan Gosling), a highly skilled operative for the CIA who becomes embroiled in a game of cat and mouse with the psychopath Lloyd Hansen (Chris Evans).  The movie boasts a star-studded cast including Ana de Armas and Bridgerton breakout Rege-Jean Page, and action sequences that feel like a cross between The Winter Soldier and the Fast & Furious franchise. Case in point: A shootout in Prague escalates to include a runaway train that crashes headfirst into a building.

Code 8 follows in the latter films' footsteps, following electricity manipulator Connor Reed as he gets swept up in a nest of criminal activity. The series boasts a pair of superhero veterans in Robbie and Stephen Amell, who previously starred on The Flash and Arrow respectively. Code 8 also features clever use of superpowers in addition to electromagnetism, including, telekinesis, and cryokinesis - which makes for some intense fight scenes.

But The Paper Tigers flips the script to great effect: the prodigies are middle-aged men dealing with issues including fatherhood and midlife crises. Writer/director Bao Tran and the rest of his film team had to fight an uphill battle as major studios wanted to pursue a version without an Asian-American lead, which was part of Tran's vision. He was eventually able to make the film he wanted with an Asian American lead in Alain Uy and a setting of Seattle, which paid homage to the late Bruce Lee. The end result is a hilarious, action-packed romp that's definitely worth a watch.

Davis is drawn into a case involving a pair of criminals who find themselves pulled into a conspiracy, and decides to lock down all the bridges in Manhattan in order to trap them. Brian Kirk, best known for directing Game of Thrones, keeps the film moving at a steady clip and puncutates it with bursts of bloody violence. Add a cast that includes J.K.

Mixing mysticism, martial arts, and a predominantly Asian cast sounds like a recipe for success, but the series didn't find its audience. Thankfully, that may change with the release of Fistful of Vengeance, which acts as a follow-up to the series' first season. Not only does the film feature the return of Wu Assassins stars Iko Uwais, Lewis Tan, & Lawrence Kao but it features what may be some of the best martial arts sequences in a modern-day action film, courtesy of director Roel Reine. Give it a watch if you loved Mortal Kombat or Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and keep your eyes peeled for Halo on Paramount+ as Reine is set to direct episodes of the video game adaptation.

Netflix currently hosts one of his most underrated films, The Take, which even cracked its Top 10 list! Originally titled Bastille Day, the film follows CIA agent Sean Briar (Elba) and pickpocket Michael Mason (Richard Madden) as they race to stop a group of corrupt police officers from stealing half a billion euros from the French national bank under the guise of a terrorist attack. The film features shootouts and fights that have Elba using his muscle and height to pummel opponents into submission.

Samuel said that he grew up watching Westerns and it shows: from the opening title to the shootout in the final act, there is plenty of Stetson and six shooting action to go around, and horses charging through the dusty plains. And that's not even counting the film's stacked cast, which includes the talents of Jonathan Majors, Regina King, and Delroy Lindo; Idris Elba is also a revelation as the villainous Rufus Buck.

However, indie publisher Image Comics has also dipped its toe into this pool, with the best effort being The Old Guard. Based on the miniseries by Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernandez, the film follows a group of immortal mercenaries who find themselves on the run from a Pharma Bro who wants to harness their abilities for profit. Really all you need to know is that KiKi Layne is a born action star and Charlize Theron wields a massive battle axe (and looks great doing it).

One of the first projects they produced was the action film Extraction, starring Chris Hemsworth and directed by their longtime second unit director Sam Hargrave. As mercenary Tyler Rake, Hemsworth trades Thor's hammer and golden locks for an action hero's scowl and an assault rifle, engaging in gritty and gory action as he escorts a drug lord's son through the city of Dhaka. The standout sequence is a 12-minute single take, as Rake moves thorough an apartment complex dispatching foes.

Based on the life of the Wing Chun grandmaster who eventually trained Bruce Lee, the first Ip Man features plenty of action sequences where Yen's Ip Man defeats multiple opponents - including a scene where he takes on 10 black belts. Though the other men have the upper hand, they soon suffer massive injuries at the hands of Ip Man.

One of the more recent tales is New Gods: Nezha Reborn, putting a superheroic spin on the titular god and the classic Chinese novel Investiture of the Gods. Protagonist Li Yunxiang even has somewhat of a standard superhero origin: he's an ordinary young man who learns that he's the reincarnation of a god, and even builds a suit of armor to contain his fire powers that looks like something a superhero would wear. Whether you're fans of superheroes, mythology, or animation Nezha Reborn has something for everyone.

A opiniao e de economistas e analistas de mercado consultados pelo InfoMoney.  Alguns pontos mereceram elogios por parte dos especialistas. Um e a e vinculacao do aumento da despesas ao crescimento da receita, numa proporcao menor, limitada a 70%. Tambem foi citada a proposta de adocao de bandas, que trazem uma flexibilizacao que a regra do teto de gastos nao tem. Por fim, foi elogiada a intencao do governo de passar a mensagem que e possivel conciliar a responsabilidade fiscal com a preocupacao social.  Gustavo Sung, economista-chefe da Suno Research, afirma que, de forma geral, o novo arcabouco pode ser considerado razoavel.  Pelo menos, a partir de agora podemos ter um horizonte mais claro sobre o que aguardar da politica economica. A nebulosidade e a ansiedade que havia diminui marginalmente, o que pode reforcar nosso cenario de que cortes das taxas de juros podem ocorrer a partir do segundo semestre , preve.  Sobre os detalhes mostrados por Haddad, Sung destacou as regras claras e os mecanismos de correcao.  A regra sera mais flexivel que o teto de gastos original, com foco na limitacao da taxa de crescimento da despesa primaria, a estipulacao de bandas para o compromisso de resultado primario, alem de mecanismos de correcao , afirmou.  No entanto, disse estar cetico com relacao ao cumprimento das metas para o resultado primario (de 0% em 2024, superavit de 0,5% em 2025 e de 1% em 2026).   Esse sera um grande desafio para o governo. E, ao olhar a simulacao da trajetoria da divida publica em relacao ao PIB, notamos que no cenario 1, a trajetoria da divida estabiliza em 2026. E, somente, no cenario em que ha cortes de juros, e visto uma queda na trajetoria. Um arcabouco fiscal robusto nao poderia depender dessa variavel.  Sung ainda afirma que durante a entrevista coletiva, Haddad, ressaltou o plano para melhorar a arrecadacao do governo nos proximos anos.  Porem, o grande problema do pais esta do lado da qualidade das despesas, algo que nao foi muito tratado na entrevista , alertou.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  O economista da Suno disse que ainda e cedo para afirmar como o novo arcabouco deve afetar a politica monetario pelo Banco Central no curto prazo.  Nas proximas semanas, teremos mais clareza sobre a questao de expectativas de inflacao, que tem subido nas ultimas semanas, e tem pressionado o cenario da autoridade monetaria , disse.  Felipe Moura, socio e analista da Finacap Investimentos, elogiou as caracteristicas anticiclicas da nova regra apresentada, mas alertou que, por enquanto, nao existem mais, so um  big Picture . Ele sugere esperar estudos mais aprofundados e ver se o proprio Ministerio da Fazenda ira trazer mais detalhes.   No primeiro momento, a reacao e boa. Projeta uma zeragem de deficit ate 2025 e superavit em 2026. Entao, acho que agora e aguardar um estudo mais profundo do arcabouco. E positivo na margem, porque finalmente conhecemos a bussola de gastos do governo para os proximos quatro anos. E importante tambem, agora, observamos qual sera a reacao do Banco Central , disse.  Mas Luiz Eduardo Portella, socio gestor da Novus Capital, disse ainda ter duvidas a respeito da execucao da nova politica fiscal.  E uma regra que a conta so fecha com mais arrecadacao e acaba indexando mais a despesa, porque ela nunca pode cair , alertou, que tambem ve como dificil a trajetoria de superavit esperada pelo governo.  Alexandre Manoel, economista-chefe na AZ Quest, classificou o anuncio como melhor que o esperado.  Contem limite de despesas, gatilho para correcao de rumo e incentivo para aumentar a arrecadacao. Tres fatores fundamentais para recuperarmos o superavit primario que torne nossa divida sustentavel , comentou Manoel, que foi secretario dos ministerios da Economia e da Fazenda entre 2018 e 2020.  Para ele, colocar um despesa global e fundamenta. Sem esse limite de despesas, disse, o Orcamento era sempre ficticio, pois o Congresso superestimava receitas e depois o Executivo corrigia, por meio dos contingenciamentos. Isso gera um orcamento paralelo, que incentivava contabilidade criativa e terminou redundando ate no impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   A nossa reacao a isso foi um teto, aplicado corretamente, mas que se mostrou nao adequado a economia politica. So funcionou quando o PIB cresceu abaixo do PIB potencial e nao havia receita liquida para o teto, que ocorreu nos anos de 2017 a 2019 , recordou.  Masterclass Gratuita Lucros Alem da Bolsa Como ter o potencial de ganhar mais do que a Renda Fixa sem depender dos animos do mercado e das oscilacoes da Bolsa   Nesse sentido, uma regra com um limite de despesa e um avanco institucional importante para nossa sociedade, pois significa que aprendemos com os erros e e natural que, para ser factivel, seja menos rigida que o limite do teto imposto em 2016 , comparou.  Carta de intencoes  Outro analista que se mostrou mais cetico foi Stephan Kautz, economista-chefe da EQI Asset. Para ele, o novo arcabouco fiscal, por enquanto, e uma carta de intencoes.  Rodamos alguns numeros com as regras e nas nossas contas eles nao alcancam o superavit no ano que vem. Entao, teria que haver algum outro ajuste , sugeriu.  Kautz alega que, para que a divida se estabilize, como projeta o governo, e preciso ter um corte de juros ao longo dos proximos anos, o que nao parece estar no horizonte.  Ha algumas pontas soltas no anuncio, que precisam ficar claras, para que as contas sejam criveis , disse, destacando ainda que existe toda uma tramitacao no Congresso, que pode alterar as medidas.  Jason Vieira, economista-chefe da Infinity Asset, tambem disse que a apresentacao do ministro foi um tanto pobre em detalhes de execucao.  Tem boas intencoes, mas muito foco em gasto, gasto e gasto. A melhora so sai do papel se a economia avancar e como descartaram uma elevacao de impostos, a melhora na relacao vai depender muito de o Brasil manter um ritmo de crescimento , criticou.  Para ele, o novo plano traz mais peso sobre como a economia mundial vai se sair. Do lado domestico, ele destacou que e dificil o arcabouco servir como estimulo ao crescimento.  Ele faz um colchao virtual de liquidez em anos de crescimento, bom para transformar em contraciclico um ano ruim. Se forem tres anos bons, serao tres anos de aumento de despesas fixas. E se forem tres anos ruins, como equaliza a despesa? , questionou.  Acilio Marinello, Coordenador do MBA Executivo em Digital Finance da Trevisan Escola de Negocios, elogiou o fato de a proposta do arcabouco fiscal considerar tambem a questao social do Pais.  Traz o componente de ter uma politica fiscal responsavel, mas que tambem contemple a questao social, em termos muito claros e gerenciaveis. Traz a bandeira do governo de atuar no social, mas que isso nao vai ser um ofensor para a gestao das contas publicas , disse.  No entanto, Marinello tambem viu otimismo exagerado na previsao de superavits primarios.  O que o governo apresentou hoje e o que a gente chama de 'caminho feliz'. Se tudo der certo, de fato em 2026o Brasil vai alcancar um superavit numa tendencia positiva. No entanto, os desafios sao enormes para alcancar isso. E o caminho nao feliz e infelizmente o mais provavel , comentou.  Ele lembrou que existem hoje diversas pressoes externas, que vao trazer impacto na inflacao do Brasil. E que ha desafios internos para gerir os precos controlados, para melhorar a realidade economica para que o Pais retome um crescimento sustentavel.   A reducao da taxa basica de juros e um elemento fundamental. Entre a proposta do governo e a realidade de transformar isso em resultados, tem um hiato e uma distancia grande. E o governo tem que trabalhar muito, nao somente na questao politica , analisou.  Fiscal e social  Matheus Pizzani, economista da CM Capital, tambem identificou o interesse do governo em conciliar a responsabilidade fiscal com sua preocupacao social, que deve ser entendida nao so como gastos com programas sociais, mas tambem com a retomada dos investimentos publicos como motor de crescimento economico.   O ministro Fernando Haddad buscou distanciar-se do teto de gastos e aproximar a discussao sobre o novo arcabouco fiscal a estrutura da Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (LRF), enaltecendo seus pontos positivos, especialmente no que diz respeito a estipulacao de metas fiscais, e ressaltando que a abordagem atual focara em manter o compromisso fiscal, porem, abarcando tambem as necessidades sociais do pais , explicou.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Ele elogiou a estipulacao de metas para o superavit primario, que fornece maior previsibilidade especialmente para os agentes financeiros e ajuda na ancoragem das expectativas especialmente de medio e longo prazo.  Outro ponto positivo citado foi a introducao de bandas,  uma vez que mostra o objetivo de estender a politica fiscal uma estrutura sofisticada a semelhanca do que o pais possui hoje no campo monetario .  Outra questao relevante do novo acabou, segundo Pizzani, e o gatilho para aumentar investimento publico, que so sera ativado se o pais conseguir superar o nivel da banda superior da meta de superavit. Para ele, isso concilia o interesse do governo em retomar o papel do setor publico na economia nao so como provedor de servicos essenciais, mas tambem como fomentador do crescimento e dinamizador do mercado interno.   Em suma, o arcabouco fiscal mostrou que busca corrigir distorcoes de padroes ja adotados anteriormente, especialmente no que diz respeito a possibilidade de insercao do Estado na economia, sem abdicar do compromisso em restabelecer a saude fiscal do Pais, o que e ainda mais importante se levado em conta que foi pensada para cumprir tal objetivo tanto no medio quanto no longo prazo.

Merito del calo delle quotazioni all'ingrosso dei prodotti energetici sulla scia della netta discesa del prezzo del gas rispetto ai picchi toccati durante i mesi estivi. Per effetto della contrazione, il prezzo finale della famiglia tipo (quella con consumi medi di 2.700 kilowattora l'anno e una potenza impegnata di 3 kilowatt) risulta di 23,75 centesimi di euro per kilowattora (53,11 cent nel primo trimestre), soprattutto grazie alla forte diminuzione della voce energia.

E il cui impatto, guardando ai numeri forniti da Arera, sara per le famiglie in tutela di 3,03 centesimi di euro (il 12,7% della spesa totale), in aumento rispetto al primo trimestre quando, come noto, gli oneri elettrici erano azzerati.

I segnali li vediamo velocemente trasferiti anche ai consumatori finali, anche grazie ad un impianto regolatorio che funziona. Non dobbiamo pero perdere la focalizzazione sugli impegni presi e sull'implementazione delle scelte fatte>>.  La spesa delle famiglie cresce in un anno del 33,7%  Quanto agli effetti complessivi sulla spesa delle famiglie, la crescita dei prezzi all'ingrosso nell'ultimo anno e il loro mantenersi comunque su livelli elevati (pur se in riduzione) si riflette ancora sull'esborso. Percio, spiega l'Authority, in termini di effetti finali la spesa per la famiglia-tipo nell'anno scorrevole (compreso tra il 1deg luglio 2022 e il 30 giugno 2023) sara di circa 1.267 euro, +33,7% rispetto ai 12 mesi equivalenti dell'anno precedente (1deg luglio 2021- 30 giugno 2022)."}, {"source": "il-sole-24-ore", "title": "Ita, i vertici di Lufthansa a Roma, sul tavolo c'e il prezzo - Focus economia | Radio 24", "text": "Carsten Spohr, ad di Lufthansa Group, oggi incontra il ministro dell'Economia, Giancarlo Giorgetti e i manager dell'aviolinea guidati dal presidente Antonino Turicchi.

O Ibovespa fechou em alta de 1,89%% nesta quinta-feira (30), aos 103.713 pontos, o dolar comercial caiu 0,73, a R$ 5,098 na venda e a R$ 5,097 na compra, assim como os juros futuros, tudo isso apos o tao esperado anuncio do arcabouco fiscal.  O principal indice da Bolsa brasileira se saiu ainda consideravelmente melhor do que seus pares em Nova York - Dow Jones, S&P 500 e Nasdaq tiveram altas menores de, respectivamente, 0,43%, 0,57% e 0,73%.  Por la, o dia nao teve grandes destaques. Investidores ainda repercutem o menor temor com a crise dos bancos. Alem disso, uma alta dos pedidos de auxilio desemprego na semana encerrada no dia 25 de marco, de 198 mil ante consenso de 196 mil, ajudou a reforcar a tese de que o Federal Reserve pode ser mais brando em sua politica monetaria.  O que puxou o Ibovespa foi, entao, o cenario interno.  Para analistas de mercado consultados pelo InfoMoney, o arcabouco anunciado por Fernando Haddad, ministro da Fazenda, na manha desta quinta, foi uma carta de intencoes positiva e ajudou a dar um norte para o mercado, ainda que algumas projecoes que guiam o governo em busca de uma sustentabilidade da divida sejam muito otimistas. Com isso, os especialistas esperam ainda por mais detalhes, o que podem determinar novos ganhos do indice ou levar a um novo movimento de pressao.  A proposta do governo para o novo arcabouco fiscal tera uma trava para impedir que os gastos federais crescam mais do que a arrecadacao, mas contara tambem com um limite minimo para a evolucao das despesas. A medida estabelece ainda que as despesas publicas nao poderao crescer mais do que 70% da variacao das receitas.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   Em linhas gerais, a composicao do arcabouco fiscal mostrou o interesse do governo em conciliar a responsabilidade fiscal com sua preocupacao social, que deve ser entendida nao so como gastos com programas sociais, mas tambem com a retomada dos investimentos publicos como motor de crescimento economico , aponta Matheus Pizzani, economista da CM Capital.  Rafaela Vitoria, economista-chefe do banco Inter, aponta que o governo tem uma meta agressiva de gerar superavit ja a partir de 2025, estimando deficit de 0,5% em 2023, 0% em 2024 e superavit de 0,5% em 2025, o que e bem melhor do que as estimativas do mercado: -1%, -0,8% e -0,5%, respectivamente. Cabe destacar que as metas de primario propostas tem  bandas : para 2025, a meta e de superavit de 0,5% do PIB, com intervalo de tolerancia de superavits de 0,25% e 0,75% do PIB. E para 2026, o objetivo central a ser perseguido e de superavit de 1,00% do PIB, com bandas de superavits de 0,75% e 1,25% do PIB.   Caso esse cenario se concretize, o juro real pode ter queda significativa nos proximos anos e a estabilizacao da divida seria mais rapida. No entanto, o governo nao deu detalhes sobre como chegara nesse resultado , aponta.  A curva de juros brasileira, ao menos momentaneamente, recuou bem. Os DIs para 2024 perderam quatro pontos-base, a 13,17%, e os para 2025, 18 pontos, a 11,97%. As taxas dos contratos para 2027 e 2029 recuaram, respectivamente, 21,5 e 17 pontos, a 12,08% e 12,54%. Os DIs para 2031 foram a 12,81%, com menos 15 pontos.  Alem disso, as projecoes de trajetoria da divida apresentadas foram bastante agressivas. Na simulacao da economista, em um cenario de 1% de superavit a partir de 2026 e juros reais convergindo para 3%, a divida estabilizaria em 79% do PIB a partir de 2026, enquanto o governo projeta, no cenario mais otimista, 73% de divida/PIB em 2026.  Leia tambem Impostos Governo encaminhara medidas ao Congresso para que quem nao paga imposto passe a pagar, diz Haddad  Vamos ter que enfrentar a agenda contra o patrimonialismo e acabar com uma serie de abusos que foram cometidos contra o Estado , disse  O crescimento real dos gastos deve ficar entre 0,6% e 2,5% ao ano e fica limitado a 70% do crescimento da receita acumulada em 12 meses, e nao com base em estimativas, evitando projecoes infladas como ja ocorrido no passado.  O limite de crescimento real de gastos de 2,5% e positivo, caso seja aprovado, mesmo excluindo o Fundeb e o piso de enfermagem , avalia.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Rafaela lembra que, em 2023, as despesas devem crescer cerca de 6% acima da inflacao, o que foi a media de crescimento entre 2003 e 2015. Portanto, o limite de 2,5% e uma moderacao e sera condicionado ao crescimento da arrecadacao, alem de indicar uma flexibilidade em relacao a regra anterior do teto de gastos, que, por ter sido muito restritiva, acabou se tornando ineficiente.  O investimento deve ter um piso e o governo indicou uma curva de crescimento entre 2,2% e 3,2% do total das despesas primarias e que poderia ser maior, caso o superavit fique acima da meta. O governo nao deixou claro quais investimentos e qual seria exatamente o piso, mas 2,2% das despesas significam investimentos proximos de R$ 45 bilhoes esse ano, crescendo para R$ 65 bilhoes ate 2026.   Apesar das projecoes do governo serem positivas, sao tambem muito otimistas e deixam duvidas sobre sua execucao, principalmente pelo lado da recomposicao de receita, que estimamos ser necessaria entre R$ 50 bilhoes a 150 bilhoes/ano, entre 2023 e 2025, sendo que nao ha indicacao especifica de aumento de impostos nesse momento , aponta a economista.  Ela destaca que os mercados tiveram uma reacao positiva ao anuncio, com o dolar e juros em queda. Contudo, melhoras mais profundas, no entanto, principalmente a esperada queda da taxa de juros real, vao depender da aprovacao do projeto e melhora efetiva nos resultados fiscais ao longo de 2023 e 2024, avalia.  Na mesma linha, Gustavo Arruda, diretor de Pesquisas para America Latina do BNP Paribas, ressalta que as novas regras parecem se apoiar em pressupostos muito otimistas para os proximos anos.  Nossas contas aqui nao refletem os numeros que o governo apresentou, a nao ser que a gente assuma um quadro de suposicoes otimistas no modelo que nao parecem em linha com o que temos visto para a economia brasileira e global , aponta.  Lucros Alem da Bolsa Masterclass Gratuita Como ter o potencial de ganhar mais do que a Renda Fixa sem depender dos animos do mercado e das oscilacoes da Bolsa   Tivemos uma analise boa para o mercado... Pode gastar 70% da receita, caso nao seja respeitada cai para 50%, o que mantem as bases alinhadas, na teoria isso e perfeito, e o que os investidores querem ouvir, esse e o caminho para controlar o fiscal e nao quebrar o pais. Porem, o governo com causas sociais voltadas para esquerda, que e o que temos hoje, acaba tendo em seu DNA gastar com medidas sociais. O desafio e ver como isso devera ser respeitado e quem ira pagar a conta , avalia Luciano Feres, economista e CFO da Somus Capital.  Alexandre Lohmann, estrategista-chefe da Constancia Investimentos, ressalta ainda que a regra e assimetrica. Assim, nos periodos de alta, nomeadamente de alta da receita com receita extraordinaria, pode ter um aumento importante da despesa, que vira permanente. Mas, no caso de uma queda do PIB, a receita vai poder crescer mais.   Entao isso e um problema, e uma assimetria que vai tender a piorar a situacao fiscal do Brasil a longo prazo. Tambem tem a questao da divida. A trajetoria da divida (projetada pelo governo) parece ser um pouquinho otimista, porque ela faz cair o peso da reducao da relacao divida/PIB com a reducao da conta de juro. Essa e uma coisa geralmente preocupante dado que... a Selic vai cair em linha com a inflacao, e nao por conta da vontade do governo , afirma.  A possibilidade de as despesas crescerem mesmo em um ano de queda de arrecadacao do governo tambem e um ponto de preocupacao na visao de Enrico Cozzolino, socio e chefe de analise da Levante Investimentos, ainda que aponte que o arcabouco traz um direcionamento mais claro sobre a trajetoria da divida.  Pouco foco nas despesas e espera pelo Congresso sao pontos de atencao  Gustavo Sung, economista-chefe da Suno Research, aponta que a regra sera mais flexivel que o teto de gastos original, com foco na limitacao da taxa de crescimento da despesa primaria, a estipulacao de bandas para o compromisso de resultado primario, alem de mecanismos de correcao.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   De forma geral, o novo arcabouco e razoavel. Tem regras claras e, como falamos anteriormente, tem mecanismos de correcao. Mas, ainda estamos ceticos com relacao ao cumprimento das metas para o resultado primario - 0% para 2024, superavit de 0,5% em 2025 e de 1% em 2026. Esse sera um grande desafio para o governo , reforca o economista.  Durante a coletiva, lembra Sung, Haddad ressaltou o plano para melhorar a arrecadacao do governo nos proximos anos.  Porem, o grande problema do pais esta do lado da qualidade das despesas, algo que nao foi muito tratado na entrevista , avalia.  Alem disso, foi reforcada pelos secretarios (Rogerio Ceron e Guilherme Mello) a fala de Simone Tebet sobre despesas. A ministra do Planejamento afirmou que  diminuir despesas nao e o foco , e na sequencia os secretarios anunciaram que o novo arcabouco nao aborda um gatilho de cortes para o cumprimento do resultado primario superavitario, e os ajustes para entrega do piso, se necessario, sera sempre nas contas correntes e nao nos investimentos.  Na mesma linha, Jason Vieira, economista-chefe da Infinity Asset, aponta que houve muito foco em gastos e pouco nas despesas.   A melhora so sai do papel se a economia avancar e, como descartaram uma elevacao de impostos, a melhora na relacao vai depender muito de o Brasil manter um ritmo de crescimento , afirma. E complementa: nao ha nenhuma sinalizacao de ajuste das contas publicas, reducao de peso do estado - alias, em varios aspectos esta se falando de aumento do peso do estado. Ao mesmo tempo, esta contando com uma variavel muito instavel, que e a receita .  Sung destaca que, apesar da sinalizacao importante da nova regra fiscal, ainda e cedo para afirmar como isso deve afetar a politica monetaria pelo Banco Central no curto prazo. Nas proximas semanas, avalia, havera mais clareza sobre a questao de expectativas de inflacao, que tem subido nas ultimas semanas, e tem pressionado o cenario da autoridade monetaria.   E, vale lembrar que existe um longo caminho a ser percorrido no Congresso, com possiveis alteracoes no texto base. Pelo menos, a partir de agora podemos ter um horizonte mais claro sobre o que aguardar da politica economica. A nebulosidade e ansiedade que havia diminui marginalmente, o que pode reforcar nosso cenario de que cortes das taxas de juros podem ocorrer a partir do segundo semestre , conclui o economista.  O economista Andre Perfeito ressalta o ponto citado pelo ministro durante a coletiva de que nao havera aumento de carga. Porem, sera perseguido um aumento da arrecadacao de quem nao paga impostos ou que esta sonegando.   Temos assim um problema na mesa. Buscar reonerar certos setores ou mesmo comecar a tributar setores que nao estao tributados e uma briga politica maiuscula, logo ha muito o que ser feito ainda , avalia.  Bruno Monsanto, assessor de investimentos e socio da RJ+ Investimentos, comentou que  parece haver boa vontade e muito esforco da Fazenda para entregar o arcabouco fiscal, aprovado pela ala mais radical do governo e, ao mesmo tempo, convincente sob o ponto de vista tecnico .   Vejo algum avanco com a sinalizacao de compromisso com o fiscal, com a solvencia das contas publicas a longo prazo. Ponto positivo. Mas, o discurso de Haddad e [Simone] Tebet trouxe um jogo de palavras que deixou muitas lacunas, a meu ver. Sobre a arrecadacao, Haddad disse que nao pretende criar novos tributos, aumentar aliquotas. Mas, na contramao, falou em voltar a arrecadar atraves do fim de beneficios tributarios que ele nao detalhou. Ou seja, acho dificil nao termos algum aumento da carga , avalia.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Para Ariane Benedito, economista e RI da Esh Capital, o mercado digeriu bem o anuncio. No entanto, a contrapartida anunciada, que abrange a taxacao de setores que hoje sao beneficiados por tratativas fiscais, pode afetar o bom humor do mercado, com novos anuncios prometidos para a proxima semana.  As expectativas agora crescem em torno do texto que trara mais detalhamento sobre a nova regra, bem como os modelos utilizados para as tratativas que devem ser apresentado na proxima semana nas casas para inicio das discussoes. A questao sobre a taxacao de setores como servicos de jogos e apostas, big techs, entre outros, deve ganhar a atencao do mercado , avalia."}, {"source": "il-sole-24-ore", "title": "Gentiloni: effetti stretta Bce cominciano a farsi sentire.

O anuncio foi feito em coletiva de imprensa realizada na sede do Ministerio da Fazenda, em Brasilia. Tambem participaram do evento Gabriel Galipolo, secretario-executivo da pasta; Rogerio Ceron, secretario do Tesouro Nacional; e Guilherme Mello, secretario de Politica Economica. Assista a um trecho pelo video acima.  O novo marco fiscal estabelece meta de trajetoria de resultado primario para o governo federal ate 2026, com banda de variacao toleravel, crescimento de despesas sempre abaixo das receitas em momentos de crescimento e mecanismos anticiclicos que garantem elevacao de gastos em situacoes de crise.  Segundo Haddad, a nova regra buscou compatibilizar boas praticas previstas na Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal (LRF) com aspectos positivos de uma regra de limitacao de despesas.   Do ponto de vista das contas publicas, entendemos que precisamos recuperar uma trajetoria de credibilidade. Por isso, associamos o melhor dos dois mundos: tracar uma trajetoria consistente de resultado primario, em que necessariamente a despesa vai correr atras da receita - e, portanto, ampliar o espaco de economia para dar sustentabilidade as contas publicas -, mas sem uma rigidez absoluta, porque as demandas sociais estao ai para serem atendidas , afirmou.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Para 2023, o centro da meta de resultado primario esta em um deficit de 0,5% do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), podendo variar de um deficit de 0,25% a um deficit de 0,75%. No ano seguinte, a meta central e de equilibrio entre receitas e despesas, podendo variar de um deficit de 0,25% para um superavit de 0,25%.  O ano de 2025 e o primeiro em que a meta e as bandas sinalizam superavit primario, variando de 0,25% a 0,75%, com meta em 0,50% do PIB. Ja em 2026, o ultimo ano do governo Lula, o centro da meta fica em 1% do PIB de superavit, com a mesma tolerancia de 0,25 ponto percentual para cima ou para baixo.  Segundo Haddad, as metas de resultado primario tem uma banda de tolerancia para evitar gastos sem planejamento ou cortes atabalhoados por parte de orgaos publicos ao final de cada exercicio.  De acordo com as projecoes da equipe tecnica do Ministerio da Fazenda, considerando um cenario de atingimento do centro da meta de resultado primario nestes quatro anos, a Divida Bruta do Governo Geral (DBGG) deve sair de 75,11% do PIB em 2023 para 76,54% em 2026.  Ja na hipotese mais pessimista, de atingimento do limite inferior da banda de resultado primario, o exercicio aponta para a DBGG em 77,34% do PIB no ultimo ano de governo.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Caso haja um fechamento na abertura de mais de 1 ponto percentual na curva de juros a termo (observada em razao de incertezas com a politica fiscal nos ultimos meses), a equipe economica projeta que seria possivel levar a divida bruta a 75,05% do PIB, no cenario base, em 2026, e a 75,83% em hipotese pessimista na banda inferior da meta para o mesmo periodo.  O projeto de lei complementar, que sera encaminhado para analise do parlamento na semana que vem, deve conter, ainda, dispositivo que faz com que, em periodos de crescimento economico, as despesas publicas nao crescam na mesma proporcao que as receitas.  Pela regra, o crescimento de despesas ficaria limitado a 70% da variacao da receita primaria em um periodo de 12 meses, respeitando um teto de 2,5% reais para esse aumento.  Na pratica, seria uma trava para as despesas, porem mais branda do que hoje estabelece o teto de gastos - regra fortemente atacada por Lula e aliados, que limita o crescimento de gastos em um ano ao comportamento da inflacao no exercicio anterior.  Ja em casos de retracao, o novo marco fiscal estabelece um incremento de 0,6% para as despesas no exercicio. O instrumento garante que nao seja necessario corte de despesas em momentos de crise economica, em que muitos economistas defendem a adocao de estimulos para a atividade.  Isso significa que, desconsiderando excepcionalidades constitucionais, o atual teto de gastos passaria a ter uma banda com crescimento real da despesa primaria entre 0,6% a 2,5% ao ano.  O percentual minimo leva em conta a media de crescimento populacional, de modo assegurar que a despesa publica por cidadao nao caia ao longo dos anos. Enquanto o maximo e uma referencia do que a equipe economica acredita ser um bom patamar de aumento do PIB, de modo a nao permitir um crescimento excessivo do Estado em momentos de  boom .   Para evitar ficar naquela situacao em que voce tem uma regra e as excepcionalidades, resolvemos trazer para dentro da regra aquilo que e uma especie de crescimento vegetativo em funcao do que se verificou desde a promulgacao do teto de gastos , explicou o ministro.   Se houver um boom de commodities por causa da reabertura da China ou, por conta das medidas que serao tomadas ate o final do ano, houver um incremento de 5% da receita de um ano para o outro, havera uma limitacao. Por que ela e importante? Porque e o colchao que precisamos para a fase ruim. Por isso que se chama anticiclico. Faz-se um colchao na fase boa para poder usa-lo na fase ruim, e nao deixar que o Estado se desorganize, sobretudo quando esta envolvido o direito do cidadao a aqueles servicos constitucionalmente estabelecidos , defendeu.  Assim como funcionava no teto de gastos antes de a mudanca implementada pela PEC dos Precatorios, o periodo utilizado para avaliacao das receitas na metodologia (e como parametro para a definicao das despesas) e de 12 meses encerrados em junho do ano anterior ao exercicio em discussao.  Isso permite que as projecoes ja sejam incorporadas no Projeto de Lei Orcamentaria Anual (PLOA), que o governo precisa encaminhar todo ano ao Congresso Nacional ate agosto, e evita superestimacao de receitas para elevar artificialmente o espaco para despesas.  O texto tambem tem mecanismo que permite, em caso de resultado superior a banda prevista na meta, o excedente seja utilizado em investimentos publicos. Ja se o resultado alcancado ficar abaixo do minimo estabelecido, o governo fica obrigado a reduzir o crescimento de despesas para 50%, e nao mais 70%, do incremento de receitas no exercicio seguinte ate que o resultado primario retorne ao intervalo desejavel.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE  Os investimentos publicos terao, pela nova regra, um piso estabelecido com base no volume de investimentos previsto na Lei Orcamentaria Anual (LOA) de 2023, corrigida pela inflacao. Uma das principais criticas atribuidas ao teto de gastos era que a necessidade de cumprimento da regra teria sacrificado tal rubrica em detrimento a um aumento real e constante de despesas obrigatorias.  As expectativas da equipe economica sao de que o nivel de investimentos em relacao a receita primaria apresente um crescimento continuo nos proximos dois ciclos de governo, saindo de 2,2% em 2022 para 4,2% em 2030 com a nova regra.  Alem disso, o piso da enfermagem e o Fundo de Manutencao e Desenvolvimento da Educacao Basica e de Valorizacao dos Profissionais da Educacao (Fundeb) ficarao fora da regra de controle de despesas - excepcionalidades ja previstas na Constituicao Federal.  O novo arcabouco tambem preve que os minimos constitucionais para Saude e Educacao, de 15% e 18% da receita liquida, respectivamente, sejam restabelecidos a partir do proximo ano e tenham crescimento real nos exercicios subsequentes. Neste caso, a regra ainda esta em discussao no governo. Mas os dois casos sao considerados no total de despesas sujeitas as limitacoes impostas pelo marco fiscal.  Ao final de sua exposicao, Haddad disse que o trabalho  nao termina hoje , apenas  comeca . Em uma defesa contra preocupacoes externadas no campo da esquerda as consequencias do novo arcabouco fiscal para o funcionamento do Estado brasileiro, o ministro enfatizou que o instrumento  nao vai ser impedimento que se cumpra com aquilo que foi convencionado pela sociedade .   Apenas que o que foi convencionado tem que ter a contrapartida dos setores mais abastados sobre a sustentabilidade do que foi proposto , explicou.   Essa regra nos permite olhar para cada familia desse pais e dizer que nao vamos admitir que um dos maiores produtores de alimento do mundo conviva com a fome nunca mais. E nao vemos nenhuma razao, a partir deste anuncio, para alguem ter duvidas sobre investir no Brasil , declarou.  Na apresentacao, Haddad assegurou que a equipe economica atualmente nao considera elevar a carga tributaria para alcancar o equilibrio desejado para as contas publicas.  Se por carga tributaria se entende criacao de novos tributos ou aumento de aliquota dos tributos existentes, a resposta e: nao esta no nosso horizonte. Nao estamos pensando em CPMF, nao estamos pensando em acabar com o Simples [Nacional], nao estamos pensando em reonerar a folha de pagamento. Nao e disso que se trata , frisou.  O ministro informou que, junto com o novo arcabouco fiscal, o governo encaminhara novas  medidas saneadoras  das contas publicas, que devem trazer um incremento estimado entre R$ 100 e 150 bilhoes aos cofres publicos, em um esforco que classificou como  agenda contra o patrimonialismo .   Temos que fazer quem nao paga imposto pagar. E temos muito setores que estao demasiadamente favorecidos com regras que foram sendo estabelecidas ao longo das decadas e que nao foram revistas por nenhum controle de resultado. Muitas caducaram, do ponto de vista de eficiencia, precisam ser revogadas , afirmou.   Vamos encaminhar ao parlamento as medidas saneadoras que vao dar consistencia para o resultado previsto nesse anuncio , continuou. Sem entrar em muitos detalhes, o ministro falou em beneficios indevidos, fraudes e cobrar de setores novos nao regulamentados e citou as 'big techs'.  CONTINUA DEPOIS DA PUBLICIDADE   Isso nao vai penalizar absolutamente ninguem que esta com seus tributos em dia , disse.  Se quem nao paga imposto passar a pagar, todos nos vamos pagar menos juros. Para isso acontecer, aquele que esta fora do sistema tem que vir para o sistema. O Congresso Nacional tem que ter sensibilidade para perceber quanto seu desejo foi aviltado na pratica pelos abusos e corrigir essas distorcoes .  A necessidade de o governo apresentar uma nova regra fiscal esta prevista na Emenda Constitucional da Transicao, que abriu espaco no Orcamento as margens do teto de gastos para a execucao do novo Bolsa Familia e de outras promessas de campanha de Lula.  A peca estabelece a data de 31 de agosto como prazo limite para o governo encaminhar ao Congresso Nacional um novo marco fiscal na forma de um projeto de lei complementar. Caso isso nao fosse cumprido, o teto de gastos seguiria como ancora para as contas publicas do pais.  Em uma sinalizacao aos agentes economicos, Haddad antecipou o calendario para marco. A decisao tambem atendeu a pedido de Tebet, para que o Projeto de Lei de Diretrizes Orcamentarias (PLDO) pudesse ser enviada ao Poder Legislativo, ate 15 de abril, ja incorporando aspectos da nova regra.  O martelo da nova regra fiscal foi batido ontem (29), apos reuniao com Lula no Palacio da Alvorada. Participaram do encontro a ministra da Gestao e da Inovacao em Servicos Publicos Esther Dweck, a secretaria-executiva da Casa Civil, Miriam Belchior, a presidente nacional do PT, deputada Gleisi Hoffmann (PR); os secretarios Galipolo, Ceron e Guilherme Mello e os lideres do governo no Senado Federal, Jaques Wagner (PT-BA), e na Camara dos Deputados, Jose Guimaraes (PT-CE).  Antes do anuncio dos detalhes para o publico, Haddad visitou os presidentes da Camara dos Deputados, Arthur Lira (PP-AL), e do Senado Federal, Rodrigo Pacheco (PSD-MG), para compartilhar o texto com liderancas partidarias das duas casas legislativas.  Durante a coletiva de imprensa, a ministra Simone Tebet foi enfatica ao dizer que a nova regra fiscal e crivel por ser flexivel, permitindo a acomodacao de demandas por politicas publicas com a necessidade de dar previsibilidade aos gastos publicos e a dinamica da divida federal.   Sob a otica do Ministerio do Planejamento e Orcamento, estamos absolutamente tranquilos e convictos que, se for da vontade do Congresso Nacional, em aprovando esse arcabouco fiscal, nos conseguiremos a meta, que e diminuir as despesas dentro do possivel - mas nao e o foco principal; o foco principal e ter qualidade do gasto publico, ter receita suficiente para garantir minimamente aquilo que consideramos essencial em politicas publicas , disse."}, {"source": "la-repubblica", "title": "Spagna, il caso Ana Obregon: una figlia a 68 anni con la maternita surrogata.

In questo caso sara possibile effettuare la comunicazione anche in assenza della conclusione del relativo accordo di cessione con la banca, mentre un prossimo 'comunicato legge' dell'amministrazione chiarira i termini della 'remissione in bonis' (e stata preannunciata a riguardo la possibilita di regolarizzare la propria posizione entro il 30 novembre con una sanzione di 250 euro).  Via libera anche alla proroga della cessione dei crediti per edifici ex iacp, onlus, lavori con 'sismabonus', mentre risultano estesi i casi di esclusione dal concorso in violazione per cessioni irregolari di crediti grazie all'integrazione della documentazione richiesta al cedente.  Appare invece definitivamente tramontata l'ipotesi di ricorrere ai modelli F24 per la cessione dei crediti (per problemi di cassa, ha chiarito nel corso dell'esame in commissione, il sottosegretario all'economia federico freni), mentre verra concesso a banche e assicurazioni con i cassetti fiscali 'pieni' la possibilita di utilizzare crediti 2022 derivanti dai bonus edilizi per acquistare btp di emissione ordinaria con scadenza almeno decennale. I crediti fiscali potranno peraltro essere compensati anche con i debiti previdenziali (e sia intermediari finanziari che privati potranno detrarre i crediti in 10 anni invece che quattro). Quanto alla partita dei crediti incagliati, la soluzione non e arrivata da correzioni al dl ma, e stato annunciato, da una piattaforma costituita da istituti finanziari.  Sopralevazione e verande irregolari, ci si puo rivalere sull'amministratore se non vengono fatti lavori di Superbonus? di Antonella Donati 30 Marzo 2023  Nella lista degli Interventi nuovamente ammessi a sconto in fattura con cessione del credito figurano, quindi, i lavori eseguiti in base a 'varianti' ai progetti iniziali decise dopo il 16 febbraio, e quelli della cosiddetta 'edilizia libera' (come caldaie o infissi) i cui lavori non erano ancora iniziati prima dell'emanazione del dl. In questi casi si potra accedere ai bonus se e stato gia stipulato un accordo vincolante tra le parti per la fornitura dei beni e dei servizi. Continueranno a poter accedere al meccanismo del superbonus anche i lavori di rigenerazione urbana o finalizzati alla rimozione di barriere architettoniche e quelli realizzati nelle aree danneggiate dai terremoti che si sono succeduti a partire dal 2009."}, {"source": "la-repubblica", "title": "Migranti, tensostrutture nei porti, tendopoli per l'accoglienza e navi per svuotare Lampedusa: cosi il Vimina...", "text": "Il prefetto di Parma Antonio Garufi e il primo a pronunciare quelle due parole, requisizioni e tendopoli, che nessun amministratore locale d'Italia vuol sentire.

L'intervento delle autorita per scongiurare il peggio per il sistema creditizio ha fatto tornare il sereno sui mercati, dopo i temporali provocati dai crack delle banche Usa e dalla crisi del Credit Suisse. I dati macro, inoltre, hanno evidenziato che l'inflazione sta rallentando il passo: a marzo e calata in Spagna e in Germania e nell'ultimo scorcio del 2022 ha inoltre frenato negli States. Cosi gli investitori scommettono che le banche centrali rivedranno la condotta di politica monetaria, fino a oggi improntata alla severita. Milano ha guadagnato l'1%, anche se il rendimento dei Btp italiani a dieci anni salito al 4,2% (dal 4,13%), mentre lo spread si e portato a 184,5 punti (da 183).    Si raffredda l'inflazione in Spagna e in Germania. Pil Usa sotto la lente  Le Borse europee sono partite al rialzo e si sono mantenute positive per tutta la giornata, complice anche l'andatura di Wall Street, dove il timore per la tenuta delle banche sembra essere ormai sotto controllo (in chiusura Dow +0,43%, S&P 500 +0,57%, Nasdaq +0,73%). Del resto le autorita non solamente sono intervenute, ma sono pronte a rivedere le regole. Ad esempio Janet Yellen, e tornata a chiedere regole piu stringenti. Intervenendo a una conferenza della National Association for Business Economics, per un premio in memoria di Paul Volcker, ex presidente della Federal Reserve, la Yellen ha detto che le regole sono state allentate troppo negli ultimi anni e che dunque serve intervenire, soprattutto dopo le chiusure di Silicon Valley Bank e Signature Bank. La presa di posizione delle autorita, comunque, fa sperare agli investitori che il peggio sia alle spalle. Intanto sul fronte macro negli States e stata diffusa l'ultima lettura sul pil del quarto trimestre 2022: secondo le stime del Dipartimento del Commercio e salito del 2,6%, rallentando il passo rispetto al +3,2% del terzo trimestre. Il dato e risultato lievemente al di sotto delle attese e della seconda lettura (+2,7%). Nell'intero 2022, cosi il pil Usa ha registrato un progresso del 2,1%, dopo il +5,9% del 2021. Il Dipartimento del Commercio ha inoltre reso noto che l'inflazione Pce nel quarto trimestre del 2022 si e attestata al 3,7% (in linea con la seconda lettura), rallentando il passo rispetto al +4,8% del terzo trimestre e al +7,3% del secondo. E' pero risultata al 4,4% l'inflazione Pce core, dal +4,3% della seconda lettura. Nel 2022, il dato Pce e aumentato del 6,3%, dopo il +4% del 2021. Il dato 'core' annuale e aumentato del 5%, dopo il +3,5% del 2021. Sempre oggi e stato annunciato che il numero dei lavoratori che per la prima volta hanno richiesto i sussidi di disoccupazione, nella settimana terminata il 25 marzo, e aumentato di 7.000 unita a 198.000. Le attese erano per un dato a 195.000. In Europa gli investitori hanno apprezzato il rallentamento dell'inflazione in Germania e Spagna. Nel dettaglio i prezzi al consumo tedeschi a marzo sono saliti dello 0,8% su base mensile e del 7,4% su base annua, rispetto al +0,8% e +8,7% di febbraio. Il dato, pero, e risultato superiore alle attese. In Spagna, invece, l'inflazione ha stupito gli economisti, dimezzandosi al 3,1% a marzo contro il rialzo del 6% su base annua calcolato il mese precedente. Gli investitori hanno subito iniziato a scommettere che la Banca centrale europea, a questo punto, sara piu riflessiva prima di procedere a eventuali nuovi rialzi del costo del denaro. Intanto, nel suo Bollettino mensile, l'istituto e tornato a ribadire che le banche europee sono solide e che comunque se fosse necessario interverra. L'Eurotower e tornato anche a sottolineare che le decisioni di politica monetaria saranno prese in base ai dati macro.  Loading...

Ancora una volta ha catalizzato l'attenzione Telecom Italia (+1,28%), con gli investitori che ancora cercano di capire il futuro della societa. Intanto il socio Vivendi ha chiesto al cda di valutare per Netco solo offerte che siano adeguate rispetto al valore dell'asset e ha inoltre indicato che le decisioni su eventuali vendite dovrebbero passare dall'assemblea straordinaria. Hanno invece perso quota le azioni di Poste Italiane (-1%), nel giorno in cui il gruppo ha diffuso i conti archiviati con un utile netto di 1,51 miliardi, in calo del 4,3% su base annua rispetto al 2021, ma pari al doppio del livello del 2017 che si attestava a 0,7 miliardi. Il cda ha inoltre proposto un dividendo di 0,65 euro, rivisto al rialzo del 10% grazie alla forte performance finanziaria e alla maggiore visibilita sul 2023.

E' inoltre stata proposta una cedola di 0,25 euro per azione, ben al di sopra delle stime degli analisti, corrispondente a un payout di circa l'80%. Hanno inoltre continuato a salire le Brunello Cucinelli(+3,4%), che cosi da inizio anno vantano un rialzo complessivo attorno al 30%. Jefferies ha promosso la decisione della societa di lanciare un profumo, che sara in vendita in Europa e Medio Oriente a partire da maggio, negli States a ottobre e in Asia nel gennaio 2024. Si sono mosse al rialzo anche le Danieli Ord (+1,87%), dopo che la societa ha comunicato che il raggruppamento temporaneo tra Siemens Energy e Fata (societa che fa parte della stessa danieli) fornira quattro stazioni di conversione per il progetto `Tyrrhenian link` di Terna.

Anche per i consumi elettrici: per il prossimo trimestre (da aprile a giugno) la tariffa scendera del 55,3%, nonostante il governo abbia cancellato gli sconti che da meta dell'anno scorso hanno azzerato gli oneri di sistema, la voce dedicata per lo piu agli incentivi per le rinnovabili.  Ma cosa e avvenuto per determinare un calo cosi clamoroso del costo dell'elettricita, che si somma al meno 19,5% del trimestre precedente? Cosi come e avvenuto per le tariffe del gas (calate del 34% a gennaio e del 19% a febbraio), tutto dipende dalla discesa precipitosa del prezzo del metano a partire dall'autunno scorso, sceso dai 200 euro al megawattora di fine settembre ai 43 euro della chiusura di ieri al Ttf, indice di riferimento sulla piazza di Amsterdam, punto di riferimento per i trader in Europa.  Il gas e il principale combustibile utilizzato nelle centrali elettriche italiane e indirizza il prezzo all'ingrosso dell'energia per operatori e imprese. Quest'ultimo e cosi sceso del 36% rispetto al trimestre precedente e anche le previsioni per i prossimi mesi rimangono a livelli contenuti. E soprattutto quest'ultimo elemento ad aver convinto ieri il collegio dell'Arera, l'Autorita che regola Energia, Reti e Ambiente a determinare un calo delle tariffe dell'elettricita cosi significativo.  A cui si sommano le ragioni che erano gia alla base del calo del gas nei mesi scorsi: la minore domanda in Europa a causa dell'inverno piu mite del previsto, un aumento molto contenuto della richiesta di Gnl (il gas naturale liquefatto che viaggia via nave) da parte dell'Asia e della Cina in particolare, nonche un aumento dell'offerta di gas da parte degli Stati Uniti che e andato a sostituire le importazioni dalla Russia.  Il calo delle bollette e evidente soprattutto alla voce  energia , il cuo costo scendera del 69%, mentre il ritorno degli oneri di sistema pesera sul 6,9% del totale della spesa. Il governo era gia intervenuto con il decreto bollette (che ha avuto il via libera definitivo ieri dal Quirinale), il quale prevede il potenziamento dei bonus sociali elettricita e gas per le famiglie con livello Isee fino a 15mila euro (con il livello Isee per le famiglie numerose, con almeno 4 figli a carico, che sale a 30mila Euro).  Ma se si guarda sull'orizzonte temporale di un anno, comunque, la crescita dei prezzi all'ingrosso rimane comunque e elvato e questo si riflette sulla spesa complessiva per la bolletta elettrica, come si legge nel comunicato dell'Arera: <<In termini di effetti finali la spesa per la famiglia-tipo nell'anno scorrevole, compreso tra 1 luglio 2022 e 30 giugno 2023 - sara di circa 1267 euro, +33,7% rispetto ai 12 mesi equivalenti dell'anno precedente (1 luglio 2021- 30 giugno 2022)>>."}, {"source": "la-repubblica", "title": "Sondaggi politici, tra diritti e Pnrr il centrodestra perde consensi.

El papa Francisco paso la tarde en el Hospital Gemelli dedicandose al descanso, a la oracion y a algunos temas de trabajo , dijo el director de la Sala de Prensa de la Santa Sede, Matteo Bruni, que sumo luego informacion del equipo medico que esta siguiendo la salud del Papa, que cumplio 86 anos el 17 de diciembre pasado.  Periositas frente al hospital Agostino Gemelli, donde esta internado el apa Francisco. (AP/Andrew Medichini) Andrew Medichini - AP   En el ambito de los controles clinicos programados para el Santo Padre, se detecto una bronquitis de base infecciosa que ha requerido la suministracion de una terapia antibiotica intravenosa que ha producido los efectos esperados con una neta mejora del estado de salud. Sobre la base de la previsible evolucion el Santo Padre podria ser dado de alta en los proximos dias , anadio.  El segundo parte de la jornada, que confirmo noticias que habian salido de fuentes del hospital que ya habian hablado de bronquitis, fue en la misma linea tranquilizadora de la manana. Pasado el mediodia, en efecto, Bruni hizo saber que el Papa habia descansado bien durante la noche, aseguro  que el cuadro clinico  estaba en progresiva mejora  y que seguia  la terapia programada .   Esta manana, despues de haber desayunado, leyo algunos diarios y retomo el trabajo , agrego, al precisar que antes de almorzar el Papa habia ido a la capilla privada que hay en su departamento del decimo piso del hospital,  para recogerse en oracion y recibir la eucaristia .  Una vez mas, escueto y problemente por voluntad del proprio papa Francisco, que es reacio a dramatizar su estado de salud, el comunicado del Vaticano, que maneja la informacion con cuentagotas, no dio precisiones. No volvio a hablar de  infeccion respiratoria , como el miercoles, en el segundo comunicado difundido despues de las 20 locales, cuando excluyo una infeccion por Covid 19, revelo que el Papa en los ultimos dias habia tenido  dificultades respiratorias  y anticipo que el Papa quedara internado  algunos dias para una oportuna terapia medica hospitalaria .  La internacion de Francisco, que anteayer por la manana habia participado de la audiencia general de los miercoles, donde se lo habia visto relativamente bien, sin toser, aunque con muecas de dolor al subirse a su jeep, precipito al Vaticano en la incertidumbre total, justo en visperas de la Semana Santa.  Mas alla del optimismo de los dos partes medicos de la jornada, todo el mundo cayo en la cuenta de que sera una Pascua totalmente distinta, probablemente sin el Papa en las principales celebraciones, comenzando por la misa de Ramos de este domingo, que recuerda la entrada triunfal de Jesus a Jerusalen y que abre el tiempo de liturgia mas importantes para los catolicos. Aunque en la Plaza de San Pedro ya habian comenzado a colocar las sillas para esta misa, en la que hay una gran procesion y suelen llegar miles de fieles, se descartaba la presencia del papa Francisco.  En este sentido, se confirmo que sera el cardenal argentino Leonardo Sandri, prefecto emerito del Dicasterio para las Iglesias Orientales y vicedecano del Colegio Cardenalicio, quien celebrara la misa de Ramos de este domingo.  El cardenal italiano Giovanni Battista Re, decano del Colegio Cardenalicio, en tanto, que probablemente celebrara la misa de Pascuas, dijo que se esta evaluando quien celebrara la Vigilia Pascual. Pero que, dentro de este esquema de cardenales que celebran, sera el cardenal vicario de Roma, Angelo De Donatis, quien liderara la celebracion del Jueves Santo, mientras que la misa en la Cena del Senor, del Viernes, le tocara al cardenal Mauro Gambetti, archipreste de la Basilica de San Pedro. La gran pregunta seguia siendo si el Papa podra pronunciar el tradicional mensaje  Urbi et Orbi , a la ciudad al mundo, desde el balcon central de la Basilica de San Pedro, el domingo de Pascuas y quien presidira el tradicional Via Crucis del viernes santo en el Coliseo.  Aun en caso de ser dado de alta manana o pasado, como podria ocurrir de seguir la  mejora progresiva  del cuadro clinico del Papa, seguramente los medicos le recomendaran participar lo menos posible de las celebraciones, sobre todo si son al aire libre. Estar a la intemperie despues de una infeccion respiratoria y sobre todo cuando el pronostico metereologico sigue hablando de temperaturas invernales en los proximos dias, resulta totalmente desaconsejable.  Fuentes de prensa italianas, en tanto, ya por la manana aseguraban que los medicos del Gemelli habian descartado una neumonia o problemas cardiacos, como se temio el miercoles. Aunque la comunicacion oficial nunca lo dijo, sino que hablo en un principio de  controles precedentemente programados , el Papa utilizo una ambulancia para ir ayer al mediodia al Gemelli, tras tener un malestar y dolores en el pecho que hicieron pensar en problemas cardio-respiratorios graves.  Se hablaba de una infeccion respiratoria  leve , de una bronquitis -como confirmo mas tarde el Vaticano- y de  unas lineas de fiebre  que, no obstante, no menciono el parte medico del Vaticano de la noche.  Lo cierto es que, confirmando de que el Papa -que nunca para-, sigue trabajando desde el hospital Gemelli, como pudo saber La Nacion, a traves de su secretario privado, le envio al juez Roberto Gallardo, que organizo una cumbre de jueces en la Pontificia Academia de Ciencias Sociales que deberia haber cerrado manana, el texto que sera leido entonces.  Llegan buenas noticias sobre la evolucion de su dolencia, parece que todo esta mejor y ademas su secretario privado me acaba de mandar un mensaje que seguramente leera manana el cardenal Turkson (Peter, canciller de la Pontificia Academia de Ciencias Sociales), algo que obviamente lo hace bajo la orden de el y son cosas que escribio el, asi que es todo muy alentador , dijo Gallardo.  Aunque no la maneja en forma directa, desde su cuenta de Twitter el Papa quiso agradecer a sus mas de 18 millones de followers, los mensajes de buenos augurios recibidos.

El plan del Palacio de Hacienda tiene tres pilares: un nuevo programa para alentar las exportaciones agroindustriales y de las economias regionales -un dolar agro, heredero del dolar soja-, una simplificacion del regimen impositivo que toca las importaciones y el turismo para unificar los llamados dolar  Coldplay ,  Qatar  o  Tecno  y mas fondos frescos de organismos multilaterales.  El nuevo regimen para alentar exportaciones, que se anunciaria el lunes, sera temporal: durara 90 dias para productos de las economias regionales como mani, arroz o el vino, y 30 dias para la soja. Para evitar un impacto en la inflacion, los productos incluidos dentro del nuevo esquema que se consuman en el pais irian acompanados de un acuerdo con las camaras empresariales que participan de la negociacion.  Con este nuevo programa, el Ministerio de Economia espera que se liquiden alrededor de US$15.000 millones en exportaciones hasta octubre.   El desafio es impulsar esta medida para fortalecer en el segundo trimestre las reservas y continuar el camino de estabilizacion que tiene que recorrer la Argentina , dijo Massa a corresponsales argentinos en Washington.  La sequia nos golpeo muy fuerte. Lo asume el Fondo, lo asumen todos aquellos que entienden el peso que tiene el sector agroexportador en la economia argentina, y creemos que asi como tomamos medidas para proteger y ayudar con beneficios impositivos a los productores que fueron victimas de la sequia, tambien tomamos medidas para promover las exportaciones y consolidar al agro en la posibilidad de cumplir sus contratos y al Banco Central en la posibilidad de fortalecer las reservas , indico.  Sergio Massa se reunio con Gita Gopinath, Subdirectora Gerente del FMI MECON  El nuevo dolar  agro  se discutio con el staff del Fondo Monetario Internacional (FMI), donde nunca termino de digerir el dolar  soja  -el organismo rechaza la implementacion de tipos de cambio multiples-, que de todos modos se termino avalando ante las enormes dificultades del pais para sumar reservas a las arcas del Banco Central, ahora agravadas por la sequia.  Para el Fondo, la acumulacion de reservas es de vital importancia porque con esos recursos el Gobierno luego paga la deuda vigente con el organismo.  Ademas del nuevo dolar  agro , el Ministerio de Economia comenzara a trabajar en una simplificacion del regimen vigente para las importaciones y el turismo.  Aunque existe un solo tipo de cambio para importar, el dolar oficial, la multiplicidad de impuestos ha llevado a que, en la practica, se hable de un dolar  Qatar ,  Coldplay ,  Tarjeta  o  Tecno . Ese tambien ha sido un tema rispido en las discusiones con el Fondo, que, con todo, ha mostrado una notable flexibilidad para acomodar sus exigencias a las dificultades de la economia argentina y las limitaciones para implementar un programa de estabilizacion mas amplio y profundo.   El segundo gran desafio tiene que ver con empezar a recorrer un camino de simplificacion cambiaria a los efectos de que todo eso que aparece como dolar 'Coldplay', 'Tecno', empiece a trabajar y a operar en un esquema mas unificado , dijo Massa.  Massa y su equipo comenzaran a darle forma a ese nuevo esquema -sobre el que todavia no hay ningun detalle definido- para presentarselo al Fondo antes de la proxima auditoria, en la cual se revisaran las metas del primer trimestre y debe estar terminada en junio. En el Gobierno esperan que el board del Fondo apruebe la flexibilizacion del programa argentino. La reunion del board, aun sin confirmar por el organismo multilateral, podria ocurrir este viernes. El unico tema previsto en la agenda publica del Directorio es el prestamo para Ucrania.  archivo - Shutterstock  En el Ministerio de Economia aclararon que la idea es comenzar a simplificar los impuestos que afectan al turismo, los conciertos y algunas importaciones para avanzar a un sistema mas simple, unificado.  El ultimo componente de la ofensiva para sumar reservas y evitar un desmadre mayor de la economia es ampliar el respaldo de los organismos internacionales. Massa tiene casi cerrados nuevos programas con el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID), la Corporacion Andina de Fomento (CAF) y el Banco Mundial por alrededor de US$3000 millones, indicaron fuentes oficiales.  Se trata de fondos frescos, nuevos, y el ultimo eslabon de lo que el presidente Alberto Fernandez llamo  un puente que nos permita llegar al ano entrante  y transcurrir los proximos meses con  mas tranquilidad  luego de su reunion con el mandatario norteamericano, Joe Biden, en la Casa Blanca.  Asi y todo, con las tres patas de esa ofensiva, en el Ministerio de Economia calculan que aun faltaran otros US$3000 millones para terminar de transitar el ano sin sobresaltos, mas aun teniendo en cuenta que el calendario electoral alentara el acopio de dolares por la incertidumbre politica. Economia confia que podra allanar el camino de aqui hasta fin de ano para conseguir esos fondos.  Temas Comunidad de Negocios"}, {"source": "le-monde", "title": "Video.

La AFA tiene el visto bueno de la FIFA para organizar el torneo", "text": "escuchar  La AFA tiene el visto bueno de la FIFA para organizar el Mundial Sub 20. El pais reemplaza a Indonesia, desplazada por  motivos extrafutbolisticos  por la FIFA, luego de menos de 48 horas de deliberacion. El viaje de Gianni Infantino, maximo dirigente del futbol mundial, a la sede de la Conmebol en Luque, Paraguay, acelero los tiempos. Y termino en una definicion favorable. Ahora, la AFA y los ministerios de Turismo y Deporte y Hacienda ultiman los detalles para el torneo ecumenico, que comenzara el proximo 20 de mayo. La seleccion argentina, que no se clasifico en el Sudamericano de la categoria, ahora ingresara en el cuadro principal como pais organizador.   Tengo una reunion con Infantino y se va a hablar de ese Mundial . La frase del presidente de la Conmebol, Alejandro Dominguez, en la manana de Asuncion, de Paraguay, grafico lo que se veia venir. Por mas que el presidente de la FIFA haya hablado de un  analisis  de la candidatura argentina por parte del Bureau de esa entidad (un organo que conforman los seis presidentes de las confederaciones continentales mas el propio Infantino), la AFA ya planifica la competencia ecumenica. Desde Zurich, sede de la FIFA, llego el ansiado ok. Las razones son politicas, estrategicas y deportivas. El titulo en Qatar 2022 revitalizo al futbol argentino, tanto dentro como fuera de la cancha.  La AFA esperaba con medido optimismo la definicion.  Claro que hay chances , decian en las oficinas del predio rebautizado Lionel Andres Messi, en Ezeiza. Sabian que el contexto ayudaba: la fiebre por los campeones mundiales se mantiene en los hinchas, que seguramente tambien acompanaran al seleccionado juvenil. En los despachos, ademas, no pasaba inadvertido que conseguir la sede en los escritorios equivalia a clasificarse por la ventana. El equipo, dirigido por Javier Mascherano, fallo en el Sudamericano de la categoria, disputado en Colombia. El Jefecito renuncio a su cargo tras el fracaso. Sin embargo, la AFA reconocio las conversaciones para que vuelva. Jugar el Mundial (y ganarlo) seria una historia unica. Todo indica, entonces, que el ex capitan de la seleccion podria volver.  Javier Mascherano estuvo el fin de semana en Ezeiza con motivo del homenaje a Lionel Messi y podria volver a su cargo de entrenador de la seleccion Sub 20 Twitter  Hay otros condimentos detras de la decision de la FIFA. Uno es politico: el Mundial de los jovenes viene a la tierra de los campeones de mayores. Es una especie de homenaje para la Argentina, a la que tambien le dio el premio The Best por el aliento de su hinchada en Qatar 2022. Aunque eurocentrista, Infantino sabe que la Copa del Mundo volvio a Sudamerica. Y se rinde ante las evidencias. Ningun otro candidato mejor que la Argentina, entonces. En la fila se habian anotado Peru y Qatar, entre otros. Pero ambos tienen puntos negativos. El primero perderia este mismo jueves la sede del otro Mundial juvenil, el Sub 17, previsto para diciembre. Los ultimos pedidos del gobierno incaico a la FIFA fueron demasiado: jugar todos los partidos en Lima y el area metropolitana e incluir un estadio sin iluminacion y otro con cesped artificial entre las sedes. Asi, en los papeles, Conmebol iba a perder un torneo ecumenico. Debia compensar. Otro motivo mas para que FIFA entregara la sede del Mundial Sub 20 a este continente.  ?Y Qatar? El conflicto por el que Indonesia perdio la organizacion saca de carrera al ultimo anfitrion de la Copa del Mundo de mayores. Tenia a su favor la infraestructura, flamante, y la certeza de poder realizar todos los trabajos previos sin ningun problema. Pero la clasificacion del equipo israeli a su primer Mundial Sub 20 y la militancia del gobierno qatari en la causa palestina hacen que la FIFA no quiera mas problemas. Una carta del gobernador de Bali pidiendo la expulsion del seleccionado juvenil del estado hebreo hizo que el sorteo se suspendiera. Y, mas tarde, la FIFA le quito la organizacion a Indonesia por  cuestiones extrafutbolisticas . Ahora, entonces, la FIFA quiere que se hable de futbol. Nada mejor que hacerlo, entonces, en el pais de los campeones del mundo. En el que, ademas, hay una gran colonia de hinchas del seleccionado israeli.  La FIFA retira a Indonesia como pais anfitrion de la Copa Mundial Sub-20 de la FIFA 2023(tm)    i https://t.co/IYPfH6Qarg pic.twitter.com/Ayb4004jpJ -- FIFA.com en espanol (@fifacom_es) March 29, 2023  Dominguez e Infantino tambien examinaron el tablero politico. Darle el Mundial Sub 20 a Claudio  Chiqui  Tapia es  un gesto  de camaraderia con el  mejor dirigente del mundo , como lo definio Alejandro Dominguez, el presidente de Conmebol. Por otro lado, ambos dirigentes saben que mas temprano que tarde el dirigente argentino pedira recuperar su silla en la FIFA, que perdio en 2019 cuando mando una carta incendiaria a la Conmebol por las polemicas del VAR en la Copa America de Brasil. El futbol sudamericano le quito su representatividad y lo eyecto de Zurich. Ahora, el contexto es otro. Muy diferente. Y todos quieren estar cerca del presidente del futbol campeon del mundo.  Una sede dividida  Ante la inminencia del anuncio oficial, en las ultimas horas se sucedieron los contactos telefonicos entre la AFA y el gobierno. El vaso comunicante fue el ministro de Turismo y Deporte, Matias Lammens. La idea de Tapia es separar el pais en dos zonas:  Norte  y  Sur , y dividir las sedes en dos. El estadio Madre de Ciudades, en Santiago del Estero, tendria partidos asegurados. Por algo tuvo su capacidad aumentada a mas de 40 mil espectadores. Las sedes del AMBA, en cambio, estan por definirse. Lo mismo que las otras provincias del interior: habra una reunion entre la AFA y el ministro de Turismo y Deporte, Matias Lammens, el proximo lunes para terminar de delinear los estadios y las ciudades (seran seis en total) que hospedaran los partidos. La relacion Tapia-Lammens fue fundamental para vehiculizar la postulacion argentina.  El Ejecutivo, que se puso al servicio de la candidatura una vez que la impulso la AFA, entiende que puede haber un  gran movimiento  de divisas gracias a los hinchas uruguayos y brasilenos que se movilizaran durante el torneo. Tapia sabe desde el primer momento que el gobierno de Alberto Fernandez ve con buenos ojos la organizacion de un evento de esta naturaleza.  Todavia todo es embrionario: hasta hace algunas horas la informacion de FIFA era que se abriria el proceso de postulacion de los paises que quisieran organizar el Mundial Sub 20. Al final, la definicion llego en Asuncion. Y fue obra del Bureau de la FIFA, una especie de mesa chica con formato  6+1'': los seis presidentes de las confederaciones continentales y el presidente de la FIFA, Gianni Infantino. Tapia, que acumula tres triunfos al hilo (Copa America, Finalissima y Mundial 2022) ahora sera la cabeza visible del Mundial Sub 20. Y la Argentina, que hasta hace una semana lo veria por TV, ahora sera protagonista.

Abogada, Avila hizo su carrera politica en el gobierno de Catamarca, donde nacio, y llego a conducir el Ministerio de Mineria provincial, antes de ser designada a nivel nacional.  En una entrevista con LA NACION, la funcionaria destaco que, pese a las restricciones macroeconomicas, hay 19 proyectos mineros en operacion y otros seis en construccion. El ano pasado, las exportaciones del sector generaron ingresos por US$3857 millones. Se espera que este ano vuelvan a subir y superen los US$4300 millones.  De ese total, las exportaciones de litio fueron US$700 millones, con un crecimiento de 234% en 2022. Ademas, hay otros seis proyectos de litio en construccion, lo que explica el rol protagonico que podria ejercer la Argentina en la transicion energetica.  -?Cuantos proyectos mineros hay en operacion?  -La Argentina tiene 19 proyectos en produccion. Hay 12 proyectos de oro, cuatro de plata, dos de litio y uno de carbon. Las provincias donde mas se produce son Santa Cruz y San Juan. Las dos plantas de litio en funcionamiento estan ubicadas en el Salar de Olaroz, de la empresa Sales de Jujuy, en Jujuy, y en el Salar del Hombre Muerto, de la empresa Livent, en Catamarca. Uno esta operativo desde 2015 y el otro, desde la decada del 90. Ademas, tenemos seis proyectos en construccion, la mayoria son de litio, y estan distribuidos en las provincias de Salta, Catamarca y Jujuy. Este es el motivo por el cual todo el mundo esta hablando del litio en la Argentina, que es un elemento central para la transicion energetica, para la construccion de vehiculos electricos y para el desarrollo de las energias renovables. Todo el mundo esta en busqueda de este mineral, que es un elemento central para cumplir con las metas de descarbonizacion de los paises. Eso hace que la Argentina hoy este en el foco del interes.  La secretaria de Mineria, Fernanda Avila Secretaria de Mineria  -?En que estado estan los proyectos de litio que se estan construyendo? ?Cual es la produccion?  -Ademas de los dos proyectos en produccion y los seis en construccion, hay mas de 30 proyectos que estan distribuidos en todo el pais en etapas de exploracion, para luego pedir los permisos de construccion y produccion. La Argentina hoy ocupa un rol importante en la produccion mundial de litio; somos el cuarto productor, despues de Australia, Chile y China. Ademas, somos el segundo en materia de recursos de litio, despues de Bolivia, y el tercero en reservas (los recursos con viabilidad economica de explotacion), despues de Chile y Australia. Tenemos muchisimo potencial para seguir creciendo en la escala de produccion. La Argentina tiene una capacidad de produccion instalada de 37.500 toneladas de carbonato de litio equivalente y una produccion anual promedio de 33.000 toneladas. Con los proyectos que tenemos en construccion, en los proximos cinco anos vamos a producir 200.000 toneladas. Esto quiere decir que vamos a sextuplicar nuestra capacidad productiva.  -?Cuanto representan las exportaciones de litio? ?Y cuanto podrian representar en cinco anos?  -Con dos proyectos en etapa productiva, hoy el litio representa el 18% de las exportaciones totales. En 2022 fueron US$700 millones, del total de US$3857 millones, pero tuvieron un crecimiento de 234% interanual. El litio es un elemento muy importante para la transicion energetica, pero no es un mineral que tenga un precio tan alto o que genere tanta ganancia como el oro o el cobre. Los valores del litio tambien son muy volatiles, hoy estamos en precios muy altos, pero si seguimos las proyecciones internacionales, en 2025, si incorporamos los seis proyectos que estan en construccion, podemos estar exportando US$5000 millones.  -?A que precio seria eso?  -El precio del litio, al no ser una commodity, no tiene un valor establecido. El precio que figura de US$60.000 la tonelada es un valor spot, el precio de cuando te queda un remanente por fuera de los valores contractualizados. El precio promedio que tomamos para los US$5000 millones es de US$22.500 la tonelada.  Argentina Extrema Salinas grandes de Jujuy. Litio Ph: silvana colombo silvana colombo  -Los inversores mineros suelen tener dos preocupaciones en la Argentina: el no tener la seguridad de que se mantengan las mismas alicuotas de retenciones y el cepo cambiario. ?Que les responden cuando les plantean esas dudas?  -Es una conversacion que venimos manteniendo con todas las empresas mineras y la tenemos con los inversores cuando viajamos al exterior. La mineria tiene una particularidad. Es una inversion de mucho riesgo, no solo asociado a las condiciones economicas del pais, sino que solo uno de cada 100 proyectos llega a ser viable explotarlo economicamente. Ahi esta el riesgo asociado a invertir a largo plazo y se necesitan condiciones estables de la macro del pais para tomar la decision. Los proyectos duran entre 20 y 30 anos, se necesitan tener ciertas garantias. En el pais esta la ley de inversiones mineras, que genera un marco propicio para las inversiones, pero por supuesto esta atado al control de cambios. Son cuestiones que tratamos de remarcar que son coyunturales. A medida que actividades como la mineria y la energia comiencen a desarrollarse, van a empezar a levantarse las restricciones. Creemos que hay herramientas hoy en el pais para que se tomen decisiones de inversion y lo estamos viendo, por eso hay US$11.318 millones de anuncios de inversion. De este total, US$4853 millones corresponden a operaciones de cobre, US$5141 millones de litio, US$1293 millones de oro y US$30 millones de plata.  -De esos anuncios de inversion, ?cuantos se concretaron?  -Es un calculo muy dificil de hacer, pero hay seis proyectos en construccion y dos que se estan expandiendo. Las inversiones se estan realizando. En el corto plazo se espera que seis proyectos de litio, que a la fecha se encuentran en construccion, entren en produccion en las provincias de Jujuy, Salta y Catamarca. Se trata de Cauchari Olaroz y Mariana, ambos de la firma china, Ganfeng Lithium; Centenario-Ratones, de la empresa francesa Eramet; Sal de Oro, de la surcoreana Posco; Sal de Vida, de la australiana Allkem Lda, y Tres Quebradas, de la empresa china Zijin Mining Group.  -?Creen que los proyectos podrian avanzar mas rapido si no hubiese control de cambio o restricciones para importar insumos o maquinaria?  -Obviamente, somos conscientes que ciertas restricciones que existen hoy en el pais hacen que las inversiones puedan ir un poco mas lento. La buena noticia es que a pesar de todas las restricciones, el ano pasado aumentamos las exportaciones, no solo por mayores precios, sino tambien por cantidad. Y este ano proyectamos que sean mejores, en alrededor de US$4300 millones. Por supuesto que sabemos que las condiciones actuales de inversion no son los mejores, pero creemos que el dialogo que existe con las empresas ayuda a que puedan seguir adelante con su plan de inversion. Claro que lo ideal seria levantar ciertas restricciones, pero no es facil ahora con el impacto de la sequia. La sequia justamente marca la importancia que tiene para el pais diversificar su matriz economica y no ser dependiente de un solo sector.  La secretaria de Mineria, Fernanda Avila Secretaria de Mineria  -Tenemos muchas reservas de litio. ?Es posible generar tambien valor agregado y que se construyan en la Argentina baterias de litio?  -Es una discusion que hay que dar. Es muy buena la mesa de litio, que conforman los gobernadores de Salta, Catamarca y Jujuy, con participacion del Estado nacional. Ahi se esta discutiendo como seguimos agregando valor en territorio al litio. La Argentina exporta carbonato de litio, que va directamente a la bateria que usan los vehiculos. Para llegar a la produccion de carbonato de litio se requiere un proceso quimico muy complejo, que demanda mano de obra calificada. Hoy la Argentina tiene plantas de carbonato de litio en la puna. Para seguir agregando mas valor en territorio es necesario disenar una estrategia conjunta como pais, porque eso traer asociado muchos desafios.  -Hay muchas personas que estan en contra de la mineria. ?Como tratan ese tema?  -A nivel nacional, hace mucho no se veia a todos los sectores de gobierno hablando de la mineria como una industria central para resolver parte de los problemas estructurales que tenemos. Comenzar a hablar de mineria es un paso importante para poder quitar ciertos temores a la sociedad. Otra parte relevante es la transparencia, por eso apostamos muy fuerte a medidas como el Siacam, el sistema de informacion abierta a la comunidad sobre la actividad minera, o la Memac, que es la mesa sobre mineria abierta. Son espacios no solo de dialogo, sino de transparencia para presentar toda la informacion y que la sociedad sea parte del dialogo y del monitoreo para hacer todas las preguntas que sean necesarias. La mineria se da en todas partes del mundo, Canada, Estados Unidos, Australia. Y la mineria es central para tener el tipo de vida que llevamos, para poder hacer la transicion energetica. No hay forma de vivir sin la mineria y tenemos que ver como llevarla adelante, de manera sustentable y en conjunto con la sociedad."}, {"source": "la-nacion", "title": "El Senado vuelve a sesionar despues de cuatro meses y se anticipa una dura pulseada entre el kirchnerismo y la oposicion", "text": "escuchar  Con ardides reglamentarios, el oficialismo logro evitarle a Cristina Kirchner la dura derrota que hubiese implicado que una mayoria opositora circunstancial se hiciera con el control de la Camara alta y lograra aprobar el nombramiento de tres jueces del fuero criminal federal con asiento en la ciudad de Rosario, pliegos que el Frente de Todos mantenia cajoneados desde septiembre del ano pasado.

Ce plan, cosigne par les ministeres de la sante et de l'agriculture, se contente d'un simple appel aux fabricants a reduire le recours a cet additif << autant que possible >>, << partout ou c'est possible >>.

Lire aussi : Article reserve a nos abonnes Nitrites dans les charcuteries : le gouvernement demande aux industriels de reduire les teneurs, mais ne leur fixe pas d'interdiction  Des 2015, le Centre international de recherche sur le cancer a classe les charcuteries dans la categorie des cancerogenes certains. En juillet 2022, l'Agence de securite sanitaire a confirme le risque de cancer lie aux nitrates et nitrites ajoutes dans les viandes transformees ; rien que pour le cancer colorectal, 4 300 nouveaux cas par an en France sont directement attribues a la consommation de charcuteries.  Cette situation sanitaire aurait merite davantage de volontarisme de la part du gouvernement, qui cherche a menager une filiere qui, certes, a deja fourni des efforts lui permettant d'etre en avance sur les normes europeennes. Cependant, la lenteur de la prise de decision de la Commission europeenne sur le sujet ne doit pas justifier le fait que la France continue a temporiser sur les actions a mener.  Alternatives  Les alternatives aux nitrites existent et ont commence a etre commercialisees pour representer aujourd'hui 7 % du marche. Evidemment, l'argument economique pese dans le debat. Le procede de transformation peut s'averer plus complexe ou plus long, ce qui justifie, pour la filiere, des gammes de prix plus elevees susceptibles de detourner les consommateurs les moins aises.  Les industriels mettent egalement en avant le fait que moins de nitrites se traduirait par un risque bacterien accru. Se pose des lors l'equilibre de la balance entre les milliers de cancers provoques par les nitrites et les risques que leur suppression pourrait entrainer. Les premiers sont averes ; les seconds restent a demontrer.

La pandemie de Covid-19 a fait prendre conscience de l'importance de la prevention dans le domaine de la sante. Le sujet des nitrites est un cas d'ecole dont le gouvernement aurait pu s'emparer et qui nous renvoie a nos propres contradictions. Comme l'explique l'epidemiologiste clinique Jean-David Zeitoun dans son dernier ouvrage, Le Suicide de l'espece (Denoel, 256 pages, 20 euros), les activites humaines generent de plus en plus de maladies. Pour produire plus et vendre moins cher, nous laissons prosperer des risques en toute connaissance de cause, quitte a faire toujours plus d'efforts pour tenter d'attenuer leurs dommages. Eviter les risques lorsqu'ils sont averes epargnerait des vies et des depenses de sante qui seraient plus utiles dans d'autres domaines.  Le Monde"}, {"source": "la-nacion", "title": "?Hay autotests? Como se realiza el diagnostico del dengue y el criterio utilizado en la ciudad", "text": "escuchar  Los casos de dengue registrados en el area metropolitana de Buenos Aires (AMBA) vienen aumentando en las ultimas semanas. Los mas precavidos instalan mosquiteros en las ventanas y prenden espirales, mientras en las escuelas envian comunicados a las familias para que apliquen repelente a los chicos antes de ingresar a clases.  Y, ademas, aparecen las preguntas: ?Como se realiza el diagnostico de dengue? ?Puede haber errores en el resultado? ?Existe alguna forma de autodiagnostico?  De acuerdo con los especialistas consultados por LA NACION, lo ideal es que el diagnostico se concrete a traves de un analisis de sangre.  El diagnostico ideal de dengue se realiza a traves de una prueba PCR de sangre  Sin embargo, en zonas de alta circulacion del virus, como en el barrio porteno de Mataderos, ya se esta aplicando el criterio clinico epidemiologico, es decir que si un paciente tiene sintomas de dengue y estuvo en una zona de alta circulacion viral, se lo considera como positivo sin realizar el analisis de laboratorio.  Segun informo el Ministerio de Salud de la ciudad de Buenos Aires, en el barrio de Villa del Parque, otro de los actuales clusters del brote, estan proximos a implementar el mismo criterio.  El ultimo boletin epidemiologico semanal porteno, difundido el 24 de marzo, informo que desde que comenzo la temporada 2022/2023 -el 3 de julio del ano pasado- se notificaron 2260 casos de dengue en la Capital, concentrados principalmente en la comuna 9 (Mataderos, Liniers y Parque Avellaneda) y la comuna 11 (Villa del Parque, Villa General Mitre, Villa Devoto y Villa Santa Rita). Segun el informe, la ciudad se encuentra en un escenario  de alto riesgo .  Mataderos y Villa del Parque son las zonas con mayor concentracion de casos positivos   El diagnostico de dengue es clinico y por serologia. Lo recomendable es que ante cualquier signo que tenga un paciente recurra inmediatamente al medico por dos motivos: para proteger al paciente, hacerle estudios y que no tenga complicaciones, por un lado; pero tambien para aislarlo porque recordemos que a ese paciente positivo lo pico un mosquito Aedes aegypti que si luego pica a una persona sana le va a transmitir la enfermedad , dijo Ricardo Teijeiro, miembro de la Sociedad Argentina de Infectologia (SADI).  Teijeiro dijo que el tipo de de serologia depende del momento en que llega el paciente al centro de salud.  Si llega tempranamente, se puede hacer la busqueda del virus e incluso determinar su cepa. Si llega despues de una semana de enfermedad lo unico que nos queda es estudiar los anticuerpos contra el virus y ahi ya no se puede determinar la cepa , explico.  Ademas, sostuvo que, a diferencia de los autotests que pueden detectar el Covid, no existe forma de autodiagnosticar el dengue.  El infectologo Eduardo Lopez, jefe del Departamento de Medicina del Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez, especifico:  Entre los primeros 5 y 7 dias el diagnostico de dengue se realiza mediante una prueba PCR, porque el individuo tiene virus que circula por su sangre. En este periodo tambien se puede hacer una prueba molecular, de antigenos, que es un metodo rapido, pero un resultado negativo de esta prueba puede no ser concluyente .   Despues del sexto o septimo dia, cuando el virus ya no circula por sangre, se realiza un estudio de sangre para buscar los anticuerpos IgM o IgG, los elementos de defensa que fabrico el cuerpo contra el virus. Esta prueba sirve para saber si uno tuvo dengue porque por cada caso positivo con sintomas, hay de seis a ocho personas que se contagiaron sin saberlo , continuo.  Por su parte, la directora de Epidemiologia del municipio de San Isidro, Baarbara Broese, senalo que la prueba PCR, que puede realizarse hasta el dia 7 del periodo agudo de enfermedad, se suele utilizar en el ambito privado. En cambio, la prueba de antigenos, que se implementa hasta el dia 5 aproximadamente, es mayormente utilizada en el ambito publico.   Por ahora, toda la provincia [de Buenos Aires] esta testeando por laboratorio, pero en algunos lugares, como en Mataderos, se esta diagnosticando por criterio clinico epidemiologico. Es decir, no se realiza el diagnostico de laboratorio, sino que si el paciente tiene la clinica [sintomas de dengue], como en esa zona hay alta circulacion viral, se considera positivo sin realizar diagnostico etiologico , detallo.   En algunos casos cuando se tienen antecedentes epidemiologicos y cuadro clinico y en la zona hay muchos casos de dengue, se puede decir que es dengue, pero no es lo ideal , opino Lopez.  Desde el Ministerio de Salud porteno confirmaron que en Mataderos se esta aplicando dicho criterio y que es probable que Villa del Parque se sume a esta medida.   En la ciudad de Buenos Aires se testean todos los casos que tengan sintomas compatibles. Cabe aclarar que no se puede decir espontaneamente 'Quiero una prueba de dengue', sino que tiene que haber un medico clinico o especialista que confirme que los sintomas son compatibles y entonces se testea. Esto es asi en todos los barrios excepto en Mataderos, donde el criterio epidemiologico cambio y, si se tienen sintomas compatibles se considera posible dengue, y se hacen analisis de sangre para hacer el seguimiento de cuidado. En Villa del Parque es posible que se aplique el mismo criterio proximamente , sostuvieron.  Agua acumulada en neumaticos al aire libre, uno de los reservorios habituales del mosquito que transmite el dengue Shutterstock  Segun informaron, las pruebas se hacen en todos los hospitales publicos de la ciudad y en la mayoria de los centros de salud y accion comunitaria (CeSAC).  La situacion en el pais  La Capital es una de las 13 jurisdicciones del pais con circulacion comunitaria del virus del dengue. El Ministerio de Salud de la Nacion informo en su ultimo parte semanal que en las ultimas cuatro semanas fueron confirmados 8001 casos, un promedio de 2000 casos semanales.   Este valor es 30% menor respecto del promedio registrado durante el mismo periodo de 2020 (ano en que transitamos la epidemia de mayor magnitud de nuestro pais desde la reemergencia de la enfermedad en 1998) , dijeron.  No obstante, el total de casos informados para la temporada asciende a 9388, por encima de los 7862 que hubo en 16 provincias para esta epoca del ano en el ciclo 2019-2020."}, {"source": "la-nacion", "title": "Larreta confirmo que Pro tendra un solo candidato en la Ciudad", "text": "escuchar  El jefe de Gobierno porteno, Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, confirmo hoy algo que se especulaba desde que se reunio la ultima vez con el expresidente Mauricio Macri: que Pro tendra un solo candidato en la ciudad de Buenos Aires para estas elecciones. A pesar de no haber oficializado nombres, Larreta dio senales para allanar el camino para que Jorge Macri sea el unico competidor por el espacio, que gobierna el distrito desde 2007.  Larreta confirmo que Pro tendra un solo candidato en la Ciudad   Creo en las PASO, en la eleccion por parte de la gente. Tengo predileccion y prioridad por los candidatos de Pro, de mi partido. En la Capital Federal y todo el pais. Tenemos que garantizar la continuidad, y creo que para competir en las PASO y con los distintos candidatos de Juntos por el Cambio, vamos a tener un solo candidato de Pro. Es la forma de competir. Desde Pro la decision es tener un solo candidato , sostuvo Rodriguez Larreta, quien determino que en  las proximas semanas  evaluaran  cual es la mejor oferta electoral  para  garantizar  la impronta que el y Mauricio Macri le imprimieron al Ejecutivo de la Capital.  Lo escuchaba a su lado la ministra de Educacion portena, Soledad Acuna, una de las funcionarias que habia expresado su voluntad de competir, pero que unos minutos antes se habia expresado en un sentido similar al de su jefe politico.  Por supuesto seguimos trabajando para la Ciudad, para Pro y para la continuidad de este proyecto. Falta tiempo para definir las candidaturas, pero ninguno de nosotros es mas importante que todos nosotros juntos. La prioridad es que haya un solo candidato de Pro para las internas y eso se va a definir mas adelante , indico Acuna, que evito pronunciarse sobre si sostenia su postulacion y, por lo tanto, sumo asi a las especulaciones de que podria integrar una formula con Jorge Macri a la cabeza.  Estas fueron las unicas definiciones de la manana, ya que despues Rodriguez Larreta evito pronunciarse sobre quien sera el que lidere la opcion de Pro en territorio capitalino, donde tambien se habia anotado en la carrera para la Jefatura de Gobierno su ministro de Salud, Fernan Quiros, que elevo su perfil durante la pandemia de coronavirus, pero que ahora tambien declinaria sus intenciones.   Le voy a dar prioridad a los candidatos de Pro, a la continuidad del trabajo que venimos haciendo en la ciudad de Buenos Aires. Hoy tenemos tres candidatos en carrera y vamos a trabajar obviamente para tener un candidato de Pro que compita contra los otros posibles candidatos de los otros partidos que conforman Juntos por el Cambio , insistio Rodriguez Larreta. La primera esquirla de su encuentro con Macri fue la baja de la candidatura del titular de la Legislatura e integrante de Pro, Emmanuel Ferrario, la semana pasada. Ahora, se sumarian las bajas de Acuna y Quiros.  Por ahora, se enfrentarian en las urnas en una eleccion primaria al senador nacional Martin Lousteau, la propuesta fuerte del radicalismo; el diputado nacional Ricardo Lopez Murphy, la apuesta de Republicanos Unidos, y el candidato que defina Pro, que seria Jorge Macri.  Lousteau, que no evalua desistir de su postulacion, reclamo  reglas claras  en la competencia y pidio por la implementacion de la Boleta Unica.  En Juntos por el Cambio decimos que queremos la boleta unica en todo el pais y criticamos al peronismo cuando cambia las reglas de juego, elimina las PASO, altera todo para ver si puede sacar una ventaja del sistema que manipula. Nosotros tenemos en la ciudad tenemos ley de boleta unica y es tiempo de empezar a usarla , afirmo ayer Lousteau.  Critico la postura  contradictoria  del Gobierno frente a Estados Unidos  Por otra parte, el precandidato a presidente por JxC cuestiono al Gobierno por las  contradicciones  que marca en su relacion con Estados Unidos.  Mientras el Presidente esta alla, la vicepresidenta los denuncia , se quejo el jefe de Gobierno. Lo hizo en relacion al viaje que realizo Alberto Fernandez para la bilateral de ayer con su par Joe Biden; y a las criticas que tambien ayer emitio Cristina Kirchner, quien acuso a ese pais de participar de su  proscripcion , luego de los cuestionamientos que recibio del senador republicano Ted Cruz.  Larreta critico la postura  contradictoria  del Gobierno frente a Estados Unidos   Si hay algo que requiere la insercion en el mundo es coherencia, esfuerzo. Con incoherencias y contradicciones, con idas y vueltas, vamos para atras. Y esto se traduce en terminos concretos: menos familias argentinas que van a poder tener trabajo en industrias de la exportacion si seguimos con estas contradicciones. Si solo vamos a ser amigos de Venezuela y de Cuba, como planteo siempre la vicepresidenta, son millones de argentinos los que van a perder posibilidades de trabajo , apunto Rodriguez Larreta.  Planes sociales  Estas declaraciones se dieron en el marco de una conferencia citada para dar detalles sobre los planes sociales en territorio porteno. El jefe de Gobierno destaco la medida tomada por su gestion de que si durante tres meses los estudiantes no llegan a 85% de presentismo en el colegio, se les da de baja el adicional por hijo en el programa Ciudadania Portena.  Hablo Horacio Rodriguez Larreta, detalla sobre los planes sociales   Hoy tenemos los primeros resultados: 92% de los padres cumple el plan y sostiene su beneficio. Cumple con la obligacion del plan. Es un numero alto. El 8% restante que no esta mandando sus hijos a la escuela no es definitivo; cuando recuperen el presentismo, vuelven a cobrar el plan. En total, gracias al cambio de sistema, 9 mil alumnos que faltaban mucho, que tenian menos de 85% de asistencia, recuperaron la escolaridad. Los buscamos uno por uno y logramos que volvieran , enfatizo el alcalde, que estuvo escoltado tambien por la ministra de Desarrollo Humano, Maria Migliore; y por su jefe de Gabinete, Felipe Miguel.

Le jour meme, un communique etait diffuse par l'entreprise pour annoncer le retrait des pizzas surgelees a pate crue vendues sous la marque Fraich'Up, fabriquees sur ce site, apres la detection de bacteries Escherichia coli (E. coli). La presence de cette bacterie dans la pate d'un lot de pizzas est suspectee d'avoir cause la mort de deux enfants et intoxique une cinquantaine d'autres.

Todo lo contrario: la atmosfera en Juntos por el Cambio por el armado porteno se recalento tras la confirmacion de la retirada del expresidente. La discusion por la sucesion en el bastion del macrismo pone a Horacio Rodriguez Larreta frente a una encerrona. Mientras busca recomponer el vinculo que forjo con Macri hace veinte anos y reconstruir los lazos antes de la interna con Patricia Bullrich en las PASO del 13 de agosto, la primera posta que debera sortear en su carrera presidencial, Larreta precisa encontrar una solucion al conflicto con Martin Lousteau , el aspirante a jefe de gobierno de la UCR, quien reclama claras reglas de juego para la competencia en la Ciudad. ?Desdoblara las elecciones o habilitara la boleta unica?  El acuerdo de Larreta y Lousteau cruje por la resistencia de Macri a facilitar la negociacion sobre las reglas de competencia en las primarias portenas. Esa discusion se volvio crucial para el esquema nacional de Juntos por el Cambio, ya que el jefe porteno necesita alejar las posibilidades de una fractura con un sector de la UCR , un sosten clave para su proyecto presidencial.  Apenas 24 horas despues de que anunciara que no volvera a disputar la Presidencia, Macri exhibio su capacidad de dano. Aseguro que no se imagina a Lousteau como sucesor de Larreta y ratifico su respaldo a su primo, Jorge Macri . Quiere que el Pro siga al mando de la botonera de la Ciudad.  Fue una advertencia a Larreta, quien se comprometio a unificar la oferta de Pro en el distrito. De hecho, inicio el proceso de bajar de forma progresiva a sus cartas y se encamina a definir a traves de una encuesta entre Jorge Macri y Fernan Quiros. Larreta se alista para apoyar al postulante unico de Pro, pero antes pide explorar una solucion al problema de Lousteau, lider de Evolucion Radical.  Con ese trasfondo, Lousteau pidio que el jefe de gobierno habilite la votacion con la Boleta Unica en los proximos comicios .  En Juntos por el Cambio decimos que queremos la boleta unica en todo el pais y criticamos al peronismo cuando cambia las reglas de juego, elimina las PASO, altera todo para ver si puede sacar una ventaja del sistema que manipula. Nosotros tenemos en la ciudad tenemos ley de boleta unica y es tiempo de empezar a usarla  , afirmo Lousteau en dialogo con el programa La inmensa minoria, que se emite por Radio Con Vos. E insistio en que en la Ciudad gobierna Juntos por el Cambio, no el Pro. Para reforzar ese concepto enumero las sillas que controla su fuerza, como el Banco Ciudad y el Ministerio de Desarrollo Economico y Produccion, entre otros.  De inmediato, Jorge Macri salio a cuestionar la idea de la eleccion  concurrente : deslizo que le sonaba a una maniobra de  especulacion  politica y que podria generar confusion en el electorado .  Larreta y Lousteau se mostraron juntos en un evento de La Generacion, una agrupacion de jovenes larretismo Gustavo Correa  Figuras leales a Lousteau repiten por estas horas que la implementacion de la ley de boleta unica debe ser una decision que adopte exclusivamente el jefe de gobierno porteno.  No hay que negociar con nadie , aseguran en el circulo de confianza del senador. Argumentan que le dara mas  transparencia  a la eleccion portena y que rompera con el efecto  arrastre  de la boleta presidencial que  degrada  la autonomia de la Ciudad. En la entrevista radial, Lousteau subrayo que Macri opto por bajarse de la disputa presidencial para darle paso a las  nuevas camadas  de Pro, por lo que  la responsabilidad de la decision  es de la nueva generacion del macrismo. Es decir, Larreta.  Por lo pronto, tras la cumbre con Macri, Larreta le pidio a Emmanuel Ferrario que desista de competir. En Uspallata repiten que Soledad Acuna y Fernan Quiros seguiran en carrera. En el macrismo aguardan novedades para las proximas semanas. Quienes rodean a Larreta admiten que apunta a limpiar el camino para un unico candidato de Pro. Eso si: necesita resolver antes el problema de Lousteau.  Larreta y Lousteau se mostraron juntos en un evento de la agrupacion La Generacion  Mientras tanto, seguira exhibiendo equilibrio en esa pulseada. Este miercoles asistio a un encuentro de La Generacion, la agrupacion que nuclea a dirigentes sub-40 de Juntos por el Cambio, y busca ser un espacio de debate y de formacion de lideres politicos de la fuerza opositora. El lider de La Generacion es Manuel Vidal, jefe de gabinete del Ministerio de Educacion de la Ciudad. El evento reunio a casi todos los aspirantes portenos de JxC, como Lousteau, Quiros y Acuna. La discusion por la eleccion  concurrente  fue un tema recurrente en las charlas de los aliados de Larreta. Defendian la posicion de Lousteau con criticas a la intransigencia macrista. Alertan sobre la necesidad de cuidar el vinculo con la UCR con miras a un eventual gobierno en 2024.  En el larretismo analizan distintas opciones para solucionar el conflicto con Lousteau y garantizarle reglas claras para la competencia. Por un lado, no descartan de plano desdoblar los comicios -cuentan con pocas posibilidades por la creciente apatia electoral y el hartazgo con la politica entre los ciudadanos- o impulsar una votacion con Boleta Unica en la Ciudad. En ese caso, el jefe de gobierno se elegiria el mismo dia que el presidente, pero las boletas estarian separadas. Emplear la boleta unica electronica seria mucho mas engorroso.  Lousteau quiere competir en las PASO y no espera ser ungido por Larreta. Pero reclama fair play y que no manipulen  el sistema  para restarle chances : quiere ir colgado de la boleta de todos los presidentes de JxC - Bullrich ya rechazo ese planteo- o escindir la eleccion portena de la nacional. Sabe que el Pro tiene las figuras mas competitivas en la lucha por la Casa Rosada y no quiere que le inclinen la cancha. Y los suyos argumentan que JxC se encamina a impulsar formulas mixtas a nivel nacional, por lo que ningun eventual candidato presidencial podra negarle la boleta al postulante del radicalismo.  ?Nos van a negar la boleta si Larreta lleva un vice radical? ?Nos van a obligar a ir con boleta corta? , dicen. En Pro hay quienes alertan que Larreta y Macri deben contener al radicalismo porque serian mas daninos si compiten por afuera del paraguas de JxC.  Tambien calculan que, en caso de aplicar la boleta unica de papel, podrian licuar el caudal de legisladores que saque Javier Milei. El entorno de Macri plantean reparos frente a la idea impulsada por los radicales y larretistas.  No hay antecedentes. Cambiariamos las reglas antes de la eleccion. ?Como lo van a justificar en la discusion publica? Es un manoseo del sistema , desliza un interlocutor habitual del expresidente.

En declaraciones a radio Perfil, recien llegado de los Estados Unidos, el Presidente insistio:  Mi prioridad no es ser candidato, mi prioridad es que gane el espacio  y agrego:  Creo que para ganar las elecciones, hay que democratizar el espacio  del Frente de Todos.  Sobre el encuentro con Biden, Fernandez senalo:  Trato de ser siempre muy tranquilo y objetivo, creo que fue un encuentro necesario, no es la primera vez que hablo con Biden, ya lo hicimos en el G20 de Roma, en la Cumbre de las Americas, habiamos intentado una visita oficial y se habia postergado porque justo se habia contagiado de covid. Pudimos concretarlo ayer. Fue un encuentro necesario, Argentina y Estados Unidos llevan 200 anos de relaciones diplomaticas, es el primer pais inversor en la Argentina, es el mayor importador de litio de la Argentina .  Una nueva oportunidad de reafirmar que queremos trabajar juntos por un mundo en paz, con democracia, justicia y plena vigencia de los derechos humanos. pic.twitter.com/vj7rQdpGg6 -- Alberto Fernandez (@alferdez) March 30, 2023   Biden propuso hacer un encuentro para que participen funcionarios de los dos gobiernos, eso nos permitio no solo tener una charla franca sobre aspectos que nos preocupan sino sobre posibilidades hacia el futuro. Lo mejor que ha tenido este encuentro es que en exceso supero lo protocolar, no fue un encuentro protocolar, fue un encuentro de trabajo donde pude contar las diferencias que tenemos, las necesidades que tenemos de que ellos nos acompanen los organismos internacionales de credito en el FMI como lo han hecho hasta aqui, siempre han acompanado las propuestas de la argentina en el FMI y ver como encarar ese futuro, no es un futuro lejano, la necesidad que el mundo expresa de gas con energias de transicion, o de litio o de hidrogeno, son alternativas que la Argentina tiene y que necesita de inversores privados para explotar mejor esos recursos , senalo el Presidente.   Juan Domingo Biden   Al ser consultado sobre aquella vez que llamo  Juan Domingo Biden  al presidente de Estados Unidos, Fernandez explico:  Biden expresa una mirada claramente keynesiana de la economia y ahi el peronismo y Biden se parecen, en esa mirada keynesiana de la economia, que entiende al capital como un mecanismo de produccion y de desarrollo social antes que como de especulacion financiera, como el neoliberalismo. Me parece que tenemos muchos puntos de afinidad ahi, en la Cumbre de las Americas Biden hablo de ponerle fin a la teoria del derrame, que para una America Latina era imposible pensarlo de boca de un presidente estadounidense, pero dijo con toda claridad la necesidad de que el Estado este presente, que el Estado distribuya mas y se termine la teoria del derrame .   Tenemos una mirada muy afin, los dos compartimos una logica keynesiana de la economia y eso nos vincula. Tenemos desde el primer dia que hable con Biden, el lo repite siempre, el tiene esa mirada de que el y yo heredamos de nuestros predecesores una economia muy maltratada y tiende a buscar paralelos. Y alguna razon le cabe porque es la mirada de lo que hace el neoliberalismo en el poder con lo que hace un keynesiano. Y eso creo que en ese punto puede ser que tengamos poder de contacto que algunos lo hacen (verlo a el) mas peronista, pero no tiene que ver con el peronismo sino con las logicas de Keynes. En el partido de el tambien hay sectores mas liberales y mas keynesianos, Biden expresa el sector mas puro en terminos keynesianos , abundo el Presidente.  La salud del Papa  El Presidente aseguro tambien que hablo con Biden sobre la salud del papa Francisco:  De eso hablamos mucho. Biden siempre dice que hablamos de nuestro amigo en comun, el Papa. Siempre que hablamos me recuerda que cuando el Papa visito EE.UU. y el era vice, era el unico que profesaba la fe catolica, por lo que le encomendaron acompanar al Papa toda su gira, en toda su predica en EE.UU. y quedo impactado por el Papa, su forma de ser, sus ideas sobre el mundo. El Papa tuvo un gesto que es publico, el me lo ha contado cada vez que me vio, conmovio a su familia. Estando el Papa en Filadelfia de gira hacia pocos dias habia fallecido un hijo de Biden y el Papa le pidio que reuna a su familia en su casa, Biden reunio a 10 familiares cercanos y el Papa fue a visitarlos y darles aliento por la perdida, Por eso tiene un afecto particular por Francisco .  Argentina y la globalizacion   Estos viajes sirven para entender lo que pasa en el mundo y cuanta conexion hay entre los conflictos internacionales y la politica local, la verdad es que la influencia de lo global en la suerte de los paises es cada dia mas grande. en la Cumbre Iberoamericana fui el primero en hablar y fui el primero en plantear los dilemas que el mundo tiene, la crisis de la globalizacion, ya la globalizacion como la conocimos ha fracasado, esa idea de la gran aldea, solo genero paises centrales y perifericos , senalo el Presidente.   La globalizacion termino promoviendo un capitalismo financiero que trabajando sobre la base de los derivados financieros genero crisis de 2008 y ahora otra que no sabemos hasta donde va a llegar. Con lo cual creo que ese planteo que hice sobre la necesidad de pensar la globalizacion porque el mundo ha cambiado, no solo me encontre con que en Iberoamerica habia una adhesion muy alta. Biden dos o tres veces en la reunion nos dijo que el mundo era otro, que habia cambiado y que habia que ver como en ese cambio construiamos un sistema mas justo , remarco Fernandez.   Para lo que mas me sirvio el viaje no fue para reflexionar sobre lo que tenemos que hacer en las internas sino para darnos cuenta como esta parada la Argentina, los riesgos que corre, como se puede ensamblar en el mundo, como aprovechar esas condiciones. Con Biden tuvimos una mirada comun, en el sentido de que la Argentina tiene un futuro de prosperidad evidente, y que esta atravesando un mal trance por la situacion de la sequia, ese futuro prospero inminente hay que potenciarlo , afirmo el primer mandatario.  La polemica por la portacion de armas  El Presidente tambien se refirio a la polemica instalada por el candidato a presidente libertario Javier Milei sobre la portacion de armas.  El juego de las internas, de la politica, la verdad es que uno ve que a veces caemos en lugares donde no deberiamos caer. Llegue a Washington y habia banderas a media asta, pregunte la causa y era por la matanza en Nashville, es algo permanente, recurrente en EE.UU., que en un colegio alguien entre con un rifle y termine matando chicos y profesores. Biden esta planteando una ley que limite la venta libre de armas y le comentaba que estaba muy de acuerdo con eso y que la venta libre de armas es justificar la justicia por mano propia o la locura como en estos casos sin ninguna razon de repente alguien agarra una ametralladora y se carga una cantidad de vidas incomprensible. Y le planteaba que en mi propio pais hay un dilema con politicos que planteaban que la gente tenia que tener libertad para armarse , manifesto Fernandez.  La posibilidad de la reeleccion y el paso al costado de Macri  El Presidente volvio a recalcar como hace habitualmente que le toco gobernar en tiempos de pandemia y guerra:  Da la impresion de que evidentemente el destino existe, existe, y que el destino quiso que me toque gobernar la Argentina en este tiempo, pero tengo la tranquilidad como dije en el Congreso de haber dejado todo en estos anos y me llevo el honor de haber sido presidente de los argentinos , senalo.  Consultado sobre si volveria a formar una formula con Cristina Kirchner de vicepresidenta, Fernandez aseguro:  Tengo mucho respeto por Cristina, tenemos diferencias, las teniamos antes tambien. Y cada tanto vuelven a aparecer, pero tengo un respeto muy grande por Cristina. El tiempo que vivimos hoy nos obliga a democratizar el espacio. Y eso es dejar que la gente elija y hacer propuestas y dejar que la gente elija. La ausencia nos obligo a tomar resoluciones entre pocos, yo que he sido peronista toda mi vida siempre he cuestionado los personalismos y siempre he cuestionado las miradas, esta idea de las decisiones de dirigentes (unicos), es un tiempo en que la gente tiene que decidir. Lo que yo pienso tampoco es importante, lo importante es que volvamos a democratizar este espacio, que le pongamos pujanza, fuerza, que pongamos una dirigencia de reemplazo en el escenario, ese es el esfuerzo. Eso es lo que mas me preocupa, mi preocupacion no pasa por que yo sea reelecto, mi preocupacion pasa porque la Argentina no retroceda volviendo a poner en el gobierno a los que nos condenaron a esta deuda maldita que tenemos con el FMI y con acreedores privados , remarco el Presidente.   Yo no estoy eludiendo nada, dije una y mil veces que mi prioridad no es ser candidato, es que gane el espacio. Si yo termino siendo el mejor candidato sere yo, pero si es otro lo voy a acompanar. Yo necesito que el espacio gane y trabajo para eso. Trabajo para ganar las elecciones, no trabajo ni para ser el elector ni para imponer el elector. Trabajo para que ganemos las elecciones y el modo de ganarlas es democratizando el espacio, estoy convencido de eso, el peronismo ha tenido este debate. Lo vivio con Cafiero y con Nestor, que fue una renovacion de facto, porque vino a competir contra el peronismo de Menem , enfatizo el Presidente.  Fernandez nego ademas que la decision de Mauricio Macri de no participar en las elecciones presidenciales haya sido un gesto de grandeza:  Macri cometio un sincericidio: sabia cual era su suerte y se corrio antes de que la suerte le demuestre lo que la gente piensa de el. El gesto de grandeza es una construccion de los medios para tratar de rescatar a alguien que la historia seguramente no va a rescatar , senalo Fernandez.  El helicoptero  Consultado sobre las declaraciones del intendente de Avellaneda, Jorge Ferreresi, que dijo que el Gobierno estuvo cerca de irse en helicoptero antes de la asuncion de Sergio Massa como ministro de Economia, Fernandez lo nego:  Con Jorge somos amigos, tengo enorme respeto por el, almorzamos al dia siguiente de esa declaracion. Lo que planteaba en esa declaracion era que era un momento donde los medios y la oposicion estaban hablando de una Asamblea Legislativa, de la posibilidad de removerme, de que el Gobierno sea expulsado, y en ese contexto donde parecia que estaba mas cerca del helicoptero que de gobernar llego Massa. Y la verdad que es una mirada objetivamente cierta. ?Pero estaba cerca del helicoptero? No, eso es lo que muchos medios y sectores de la oposicion intentaron generar, pero nunca dudamos en que a los peronistas cuando estamos en el gobierno nos preocupa gobernar y sabemos muy bien de que se trata .  Javier Milei  El Presidente se refirio tambien al crecimiento de Milei en las encuestas:  Es una amenaza a la democracia. Muchas veces los autoritarios se valen de la democracia para acceder al poder, hay que abrir los ojos de la gente de que esos caminos no son saludables para el pais. Hitler no llego por un golpe de Estado, llego votado por los alemanes. Lo que tenemos que hacer es abrir los ojos de la gente y advertirle que esos caminos no son saludables para el pais y para una sociedad, definitivamente no lo son , cerro Fernandez.

They found that a higher magnesium intake is linked to lower dementia risk.  Further research is needed to confirm the results. In 2019, 57.4 million people had dementia globally. By 2050, this figure is expected to rise to 152.8 million. As there is currently no cure for dementia, many researchers emphasize preventative strategies such as diet. Some studies suggest that dietary magnesium is linked to better cognitive function and may reduce dementia risk. One study that followed 1,000 middle-aged adults for 17 years found that those taking the highest levels of magnesium had a 37% lower risk of developing dementia compared to those who took the least amount. Further research on the link between magnesium and cognitive status could inform preventative strategies for dementia. Recently, researchers investigated how magnesium intake over time affects dementia risk. They found that higher magnesium intake is linked to better brain health--especially in women.  Although more research is needed on this topic, the results of this study suggest that higher magnesium intake is associated with improved brain health and may potentially also be linked to preserved mental function and a reduced or delayed risk of developing dementia,  Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, medical toxicologist, co-medical director, and interim executive director at the National Capital Poison Center, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today. The study was published in the European Journal of Nutrition.  350 vs. 550 mg of magnesium daily For the study, the researchers included healthcare data from 6,001 participants aged 40-73 years old from the UK Biobank. Data included blood pressure measurements, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and dietary magnesium intake over a 24-hour period five times over 16 months. Over 95% of participants consumed stable amounts of magnesium over the study period. Some, however, increased their intake over time, while others decreased their intake. In the end, they found that higher dietary magnesium intake was linked to larger brain volumes and smaller white matter lesions (WML)--both of which are indicators of dementia--in MRI scans. They also found that consuming over 550 mg of magnesium daily is linked to a roughly one-year younger brain age by 55 years old than consuming 350 mg per day, which is close to the average daily intake. This, they noted, means that increasing magnesium intake by 41% could improve brain health, preserve cognitive ability, and lower dementia risk. They further found that high dietary magnesium intake was more neuroprotective for women than men, and post-menopausal women compared to premenopausal women. However, they noted that the decreasing magnesium consumption over time was linked to larger brain volumes in women. Links between magnesium intake and blood pressure measures were mostly non-significant.  How magnesium lowers dementia risk  It's known that magnesium is a neuroprotector as well as it having positive effects on blood pressure,  Dr. Howard Pratt, D.O., psychiatrist and Behavioral Health Medical Director at Community Health of South Florida, Inc., who was not involved in the study, told MNT.  High blood pressure in and of itself is a known risk factor for dementia. Increasing dietary intake of magnesium can have positive effects on cardiovascular health with the study subsequently showing a decrease in white matter lesions in middle to early old age,  he added. Dr. Johnson-Arbor noted that magnesium might help reduce inflammation.  As we age, we are likely to develop chronic medical conditions, such as kidney disease and vitamin D deficiency, that cause magnesium deficiency. Because magnesium deficiency may lead to decreased cellular messaging and enhanced inflammation within the brain, some studies have suggested that magnesium may be involved in the development of dementia and other neurologic conditions.   -- Dr. Johnson-Arbor  Magnesium's effects on women's health MNT spoke to Dr. Bruce Albala, professor of environmental & occupational health at the University of California, Irvine, Program in Public Health, who was also not involved in the study, to understand what might explain the increased effects of magnesium on post-menopausal women.  The authors propose that the higher magnesium intake might have resulted in less chronic inflammation in these older women. These results should be viewed as preliminary at this time, especially for the smaller magnesium dietary subgroups,  he said.  One of the interesting things about estrogen is that it is a vasodilator meaning that it can help lower blood pressure, and post-menopausal women having lower estrogen levels can in fact result in higher blood pressure. This is evidenced by the increase in cardiovascular risks for heart attack in women after menopause.   -- Dr. Howard Pratt Dr. Johnson-Arbor further noted that the difference might be linked to health conditions that occur at different rates in men and women that may impact the clinical effects of magnesium. She said, however, that the authors did not study the impacts of other health conditions.  Study limitations Dr. Albala noted that the study has several limitations. As the researchers did not include a follow-up MRI scan, it remains to be seen whether magnesium is protective later in life as the participants' average age was 55 years old. He added that as over 95% of participants had stable magnesium intake over 16 months, they had very little data on how changing magnesium intake over time affects dementia risk. He further said that magnesium consumption does not necessarily correlate with actual magnesium levels in the body nor how it impacts tissues such as the brain. Dr. Pratt added that the study investigated risk factors as opposed to dementia diagnoses.  The thing that limits this study is that a person can have several risk factors for dementia but may never develop it. There are also limitations in the lack of understanding of when and to what extent magnesium exerts its neuroprotective effects on the brain,  he noted.  Although the study authors took into account factors such as cholesterol levels, history of tobacco use, history of diabetes, physical activity, and alcohol intake when they created their analysis, they did not collect information on other conditions--such as other cancer, kidney disease, or other neurologic conditions--that may have impacted the findings in this study,  Dr. Johnson-Arbor further explained."}, {"source": "medical-news-today", "title": "Sleep aids: Melatonin linked to reduced risk of self-harm in youth", "text": "Share on Pinterest Using melatonin may have a positive effect on youth's mental health, a new study suggests. Sergio Mendoza Hochmann/Getty Images Researchers analyzed the effects of melatonin use on self-harm in teenagers and children.  They found that melatonin use decreased self-harm in young people, especially in adolescent girls with depression and anxiety.  Further studies are needed to confirm these results and the possible benefits of melatonin for mental health and well-being. Sleep disorders such as insomnia are common among young people, especially those with psychiatric conditions. According to some estimates, around 17% of youth engage in self-harming behavior. There are currently few empirically-supported treatments for the condition in youth. A recent meta-analysis suggests that treating the causes of self-harm may reduce its incidence. Some have thus suggested that treating sleep problems may reduce the incidence of self-harm. In Sweden, melatonin is the most commonly prescribed drug for sleep disturbances in children and teenagers. Melatonin is a naturally-occurring hormone that helps maintain the normal sleep-wake cycle and other biological processes. Understanding more about how melatonin affects self-harm in children and adolescents could inform treatment options for the behavior. Recently, researchers examined the risk of self-harm and unintentional injuries before and after melatonin treatment in youth with and without psychiatric conditions. They found that melatonin treatment was linked to lower levels of self-harm--especially in adolescent girls with depression and anxiety. The study was published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry .  Decreased risk of self-harm with melatonin For the study, the researchers analyzed public healthcare data from 25,575 youths in Sweden who began melatonin treatment between ages 6 and 18. The children and adolescents were followed for a year prior to melatonin prescription and a year following. They began treatment at an average of age 13 years old, and most commonly initiated treatment in November. Treatment lasted for an average of 6.4 months. The researchers found that 87.2% of melatonin users received at least one psychiatric diagnosis by age 18. Over 50% received an ADHD diagnosis. Self-harm was around five times more common in girls than boys. In the end, the researchers found that melatonin use decreased the risk of self-harm by 42% and poisoning risk by 41%. Effects were especially prevalent among girls and adolescents with depression and or anxiety. They noted, however, that melatonin use did not decrease rates of bodily injuries, falls, or transport accident rates.  How melatonin may help mental health When asked how melatonin might reduce self-harm in young people, Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor,medical toxicologist, co-medical director, and interim executive director at the National Capital Poison Center, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today:  Melatonin, a natural hormone produced by the brain, helps regulate sleep-wake cycles and circadian rhythm. Sleep disturbances are common in young people who have psychiatric disorders, and sleep problems are also associated with emotional and behavioral impairments in childhood.   Given that sleep problems can affect emotion and behavior, it's possible that improvements in sleep quality may result in improved emotional stability and behavioral control.   -- Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor  Because of this, the authors of this study aimed to investigate whether regulation of the sleep cycle, through the use of melatonin, could potentially help prevent self-harm, body injuries, and falls in young people between the ages of 6 and 18 years of age,  she said.  Is melatonin safe to use during puberty? MNT also spoke with Dr. Johnston-Arbor about whether taking melatonin regularly at a young age may speed the onset of puberty.  In animal studies, melatonin administration was found to both speed up and delay the start of puberty, depending on the animal species. Melatonin administration may alter the brain's production of hormones, including the gonadotropin-releasing hormone, which regulates puberty in humans,  she said.  Melatonin may also alter the process of female reproductive organ development. However, multiple human studies involving children who were administered melatonin over prolonged periods of time have not shown adverse effects on puberty,  she added. When asked the same question, Dr. Michael J. McGrath, board-certified psychiatrist, medical director of The Ohana Luxury Alcohol Rehab, who was also not involved in the study, told MNT:  There is no solid research that establishes a link between melatonin and changes in the timing of puberty but there are some conflicting reports, and so it should be used with caution in prepubescent children.   Limitations Dr. Lokesh Shahani, associate professor of psychiatry at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, who was not involved in the study, said:  The study used a national register to extract patient diagnosis, prescription, and death records, leading to some missed cases. Further, the effect of other sleep aids and their impact on suicidal behavior was not investigated in this city.  Dr. McGrath added that as many patients in the study were also taking antidepressants, it's possible that the results may have been affected by their use. Dr. Johnson-Arbor additionally noted that the results might not translate to other countries where melatonin is available as a dietary supplement--as opposed to a prescription--and is thus not highly regulated and may be contaminated with other substances."}, {"source": "medical-news-today", "title": "Parkinson's: Could a common cleaning chemical cause the disease?", "text": "What is TCE? TCE is a colorless liquid chemical that does not occur in nature. It is known to have a chloroform-like odor. This chemical may be found in a variety of products and industries, including: commercial dry cleaning  metal degreasing  cleaning wipes  stain removers for clothing and carpeting  lubricants  spray adhesives People can become exposed to TCE by using a product containing TCE or working in a factory where the chemical is present. Additionally, TCE can leach into the water, air, and soil around where it is used or disposed of, contaminating what we breathe, eat, and drink. Symptoms of exposure to high amounts of TCE include: dizziness  headaches  confusion  nausea  facial numbness Previous studies link prolonged exposure to TCE to increased risk for kidney cancer , liver cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma .  Evidence through case studies For this study, Dr. Dorsey and his team conducted a literature review. They compiled seven case studies of individuals who developed Parkinson's disease after exposure to the chemical from either the workplace or the environment. The case studies include NBA player Brian Grant who received a Parkinson's diagnosis at the age of 36. According to researchers, he was likely exposed to TCE as a child when his father was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The camp's water-supply systems were found to be contaminated with TCE in the early 1980s. The researchers also profiled a Navy captain who had served at Camp Lejeune and was diagnosed with Parkinson's 30 years after. And the research team also spotlighted the late United States Senator Johnny Isakson, who served in the Georgia Air National Guard, which used TCE to degrease airplanes. Senator Isakson was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2015.  Currently, the world's literature on trichloroethylene and Parkinson's disease is limited to 26 studies based on a search on PubMed,  Dr. Dorsey said.  Given the widespread use and pollution with TCE and perchloroethylene (PCE), widely used in dry cleaning, and the rise of Parkinson's disease, more research is needed. We call for that.   The seven individuals add to the existing literature -- the largest previous case series was three -- and demonstrate the myriad of ways that individuals can be exposed to the chemical via work or the environment,  he added.  Importantly, most are unaware because they never knew about the exposure and it occurred decades ago.

Rattanakorn Songrenoo/EyeEm/Getty Images Compared to people who received minimal or no weight loss support, people who lost weight through an intensive behavioral weight loss program had lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels for at least 5 years after completing the program.  Lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose levels should theoretically translate into a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but there are currently few studies that prove this.  The findings of this study suggest that joining a behavioral weight loss program grants long-term health benefits even if weight is regained. In the United States, nearly 1 in 3 adults (30.7%) are overweight, and more than 2 in 5 adults (42.4%) have obesity. The problem is not limited to America. Worldwide , nearly 2 in 5 adults (39%) were overweight in 2016, and more than 1 in 10 (13%) were obese. These statistics are concerning because carrying excessive weight significantly increases a person's risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (mainly heart disease and stroke), diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis), and some cancers. To avoid these problems, programs have been designed to help people lose weight by changing their behavior related to diet, exercise, and lifestyle. Most of these behavioral weight management programs, or lifestyle modification programs as they are also known, are effective at helping people lose weight over a 12-month period. Now, researchers at the University of Oxford want to understand whether behavioral weight management programs have long-term benefits beyond a year.  Many people fear that weight loss attempts result in rapid weight regain and even over-shooting, so people might end up heavier than before the weight loss attempt. There was a fear that this would mean that weight loss did not benefit health long-term. We wanted to assess what really happens after weight loss attempts finish.  - Prof. Paul Aveyard, Ph.D., professor of behavioral medicine at the University of Oxford and senior co-author Prof. Aveyard and his coworkers reviewed randomized controlled trials from around the world to compare long-term health outcomes in people who participated in an intensive behavioral weight management program and others who received minimal or no weight loss support. Their findings appear in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes.  What are behavioral weight management programs? The goal of a behavioral weight management program is to help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight through long-term changes in their eating and physical activity behaviors. These programs usually involve weekly one-on-one or group sessions with trained professionals such as dietitians, exercise specialists, or psychologists who provide education, counseling, and support to help participants adopt healthier habits and make sustainable changes in their daily lives. One good example of these programs is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Lifestyle Change Program, which was developed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  Review of 17,000 studies The researchers searched for randomized clinical trials that reported cardiovascular and metabolic (diabetes-related) outcomes in overweight or obese adults who participated in behavioral weight management programs. The outcomes they focused on were: the occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related death  the occurrence of type 2 diabetes and hypertension  changes in systolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, blood glucose, and insulin measures. Among 17,085 studies, they found only 124 randomized control trials which reported on at least one cardiometabolic outcome with at least 12 months of follow-up.  Lower blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose The researchers found clear evidence that, compared with lower-intensity behavioral weight management programs or no weight loss support, behavioral weight management programs resulted in lower systolic blood pressure, lower total cholesterol-to-good cholesterol ratio, and lower HbA1c (a measure of blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months). These improved cardiovascular risk factors, except for glycemic control, persisted throughout the 5 years following the end of the program, although weight regains reduced these favorable effects over time. The available data suggested that behavioral weight management programs also delayed the onset of heart disease and diabetes. Still, too few studies have measured these diseases to enable researchers to make high-certainty conclusions. Dr. Lawrence J. Appel, the C. David Molina professor of medicine and director of the Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research at Johns Hopkins University, who was not involved in the study, was surprised by the  legacy effect  of weight loss on blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose.  I was surprised because usually risk factors often track with weight changes,  Dr. Appel told MNT.  The results provide reassurance that on average, there are long-term, albeit attenuated, benefits once a weight control program ends.  - Dr. Appel Dr. Naveed Sattar, Ph.D., professor and honorary consultant of cardiovascular & metabolic health at the University of Glasgow, who was not involved in the study, praised the research and told MNT that  the data do seem to suggest that the longer one loses weight for, the longer will be reductions in cardiovascular risk factors and so the greater the chances for a reduction in cardiovascular outcomes.  However, Dr. Sattar noted that, in clinical trials to date,  changes in risk factors appear modest so any apparent cardiovascular benefits [...] are likely rather modest with somewhat greater benefits in reducing risk of diabetes (as weight loss is more strongly linked to diabetes risk than it is to atherosclerosis)   Benefits on heart health persist as weight is regained slowly In 2022, the same research group published another study focusing on weight regain. They found that people who participated in behavioral weight management programs lost more weight (-2.8 kg) than those who received no support. It took an average of 5 years for the weight of people in the two groups to become similar. This means that weight regain is slower than most people imagine. The reduced [...] cardiovascular and metabolic disease [risk factors] persist because weight loss persists for longer on average than most people think- both last for at least five years. [...] Even if weight is regained, which most people do, the health benefits persist. - Prof. Aveyard Prof. Aveyard went on to explain that:  [c]ardiovascular disease occurs because over time, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and the high blood sugar gradually fur up our arteries [a process called atherosclerosis], leading to heart attack and stroke. If blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar are lower, then the arteries fur up less, reducing the risk of these problems over a lifetime.  Dr. Sattar noted that  the process of atherosclerosis [...] takes years to develop, and to slow atherosclerosis likely will take a few years, especially if the risk factors are only modestly altered, as they are with modest weight loss.  He added that statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs) and blood pressure-lowering medications give faster clinical benefits than weight loss, but  weight loss gives other benefits that [these drugs] do not. "}, {"source": "medical-news-today", "title": "Treating a heart attack before it happens: It may not be a science fiction", "text": "Share on Pinterest Helen Sotiriadis/Stocksy The effects of a heart attack are often permanent, as the heart tissue cannot regenerate, unlike some other tissues.  This means that despite somebody surviving a heart attack, the damage done could cause health problems or death in the years following the event.  Regenerating heart tissue to allow damaged heart tissue to be treated is a hot topic in research.  Now researchers have discovered a mechanism that allows them to treat heart tissue in mice, before a heart attack, in a way that provides protection months later. Although most people survive a heart attack initially, the risk of death significantly increases over the following years. In fact, 65% of people who have a heart attack over the age of 65 die within eight years of the initial incident. This is at least partly because while a person may survive an initial heart attack, the heart attack itself, which leads to the heart tissue being deprived of oxygen and then dying, does not regenerate in adult humans. In a recent animal study, researchers identified a mechanism that allowed them to treat heart tissue and make healthy mice's hearts more resilient before a heart attack. The study's results appear in Nature Cardiovascular Research.  Heart attack and muscle death Prof. James Leiper, Ph.D., Associate Medical Director at the British Heart Foundation and Professor of Molecular Medicine in the School of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Health at the University of Glasgow, U.K. told Medical News Today in an email:  Most heart attacks are caused by coronary artery disease which can cause your coronary arteries to become narrowed. The narrowing is due to a gradual buildup of fatty deposits called atheroma. If a piece of atheroma breaks off, a blood clot forms around this to try and repair the damage to the artery wall. This clot can then block your coronary arteries causing the heart muscle to be starved of blood, oxygen, and vital nutrients, leading to heart muscle death. The amount of damage to the heart muscle depends on the size of the area supplied by the blocked artery. As heart muscle is unable to regenerate it never fully repairs. Instead, scar tissue forms in place of healthy cardiac muscle.  Cardiomyocytes are a type of cell in the heart that is responsible for the contraction of the muscle. This contraction of the muscle is essential for the heart to be able to squeeze blood around the body, in response to electrical signaling that maintains the heartbeat. When these cells are damaged in a heart attack, the heart loses some of its ability to squeeze blood around the body as effectively. While cardiomyocytes are able to proliferate in human fetuses, this ability is lost in mature adult humans. It is believed this is partly due to an evolutionary trade-off that sees the ability of mature cardiomyocytes to proliferate decline with contractile strength. This means damage caused by events such as heart attacks can not be corrected.  Healing challenges after heart attack The stages of maturation through which cardiomyocytes go from fetal to adult cells are the focus of much research. Because cardiomyocytes can not proliferate after the damage caused by a heart attack, research has been done on how cardiomyocytes can be dedifferentiated back a stage, to one where they are able to proliferate. Elucidating the mechanisms around this could provide information about how heart tissue damage could be reversed. However, previous research into dedifferentiated cardiomyocytes has shown that deleterious and lethal effects of irreversible dedifferentiation occur. This is most likely due to the fact that dedifferentiated cells could become proliferative in a way that is similar to cancer. It has been hoped that redifferentiation of cardiomyocytes back to the state they were in before differentiation, could avoid some of these complications. However, it has been unclear if the potential beneficial effects of previous differentiation to a more proliferative state would remain.  Treating the heart before an attack Researchers in Dr. Eldad Tzahor's lab in the Weizmann Institute of Science Molecular Cell Biology Department, previously identified that when a particular protein ERBB2, coded for by the ERBB2 gene was over-expressed, dedifferentiation, occurred. However, the cardiomyocytes in this dedifferentiated, more proliferative state had a limited ability to contract. Researchers then observed that when overexpression was stopped, the cardiomyocytes underwent redifferentiation and went back to their original contractile ability, and cardiac performance improved. In the lab's latest research, led by Dr. Avraham Shakked, Ph.D., they sought to investigate the mechanism behind this gene and protein and the longevity of its effects. They showed that when a transgenic mouse that had its ERBB2 gene temporarily activated at 3 months old had a heart attack 5 months later, it recovered. This demonstrated that redifferentiated cardiomyocytes maintained some of their proliferative, and therefore healing capacity. This was the most exciting finding for the team, lead author Dr. Avraham Shakked told MNT in an interview:  Perhaps the most exciting is the cardioprotective effect of this whole sequence of events that we weren't really expecting to find or see at all, and actually that has the most potential impact at some point in the future. "}, {"source": "medical-news-today", "title": "Heart disease: Nearly half of adults over 40 may have 'hidden' condition", "text": "Examining heart attack risk According to Dr. Klaus Fuglsang Kofoed, clinical associate professor in the Department of Clinical Medicine at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and corresponding author of this study, the research team decided to study how coronary atherosclerosis impacts a person's risk for a heart attack because it is the disease process responsible for heart attack and cardiac death.  It may develop many years before an individual has any symptoms,  Dr. Kofoed told Medical News Today.  To prevent heart attack, it is therefore very important to understand what characteristics define an asymptomatic individual at elevated risk of clinically manifested diseases.  In this study, Dr. Kofoed and his team examined over 9,500 people aged 40 or over who had no known symptoms of cardiovascular disease. Study participants were assessed using computed tomography angiography (CTA) to look for any previously undiagnosed obstructive coronary atherosclerosis. Upon analysis, researchers found 54% of the study participants had no detectable coronary atherosclerosis. Of the remaining 46% that were found to have previously undetected coronary atherosclerosis, 36% of participants had nonobstructive disease, and 10% had obstructive disease. Additionally, scientists found among participants diagnosed with previously undetected coronary atherosclerosis, 61% were males, and 36% were females.  The greatest surprise was that as high as 10% had obstructive diseases yet without having symptoms. [This is] a very important observation which we will explore further in additional analysis.  - Dr. Kofoed  Improving heart attack preventive measures MNT also spoke with Dr. Rigved Tadwalkar, a board certified cardiologist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, about this study. Dr. Tadwalkar said this is an exciting study because it addresses a fundamental question in cardiology -- what is the significance of coronary artery disease in the asymptomatic person?  Thus far, our understanding about the significance of coronary artery disease comes mostly from those who have clinical symptoms of the disease and have undergone invasive coronary angiography ,  Dr. Tadwalkar explained.  Those with obstructive coronary stenoses by invasive coronary angiography have traditionally been viewed as high-risk, but with the advent of CT coronary angiography and improvements in the technology, it has been increasingly recognized that specific plaque characteristics may confer additional risk.   It was eye-opening to see that among people with no symptoms, subclinical atherosclerosis may be found in more than 50% of men and nearly one-third of women,  he added.  Similarly striking was the discovery that 10% of this study population had obstructive coronary disease.  Dr. Tadwalkar also commented that the results of this study are of high value in determining an asymptomatic person's risk for a cardiovascular event.  The use of CT coronary angiography in the preventative setting would allow us to establish whether coronary artery disease truly exists, which is a question that we are often not able to definitively answer for patients under current guideline-based practice,  he continued.  Based on the results of the CT coronary angiogram, we should now be able to better determine whether an asymptomatic person is at a higher risk of having a heart attack or dying.   This is informative in helping us craft appropriate preventative strategies so that people deemed to be at higher risk have a much better chance of not succumbing to a cardiovascular event,  Dr. Tadwalkar added."}, {"source": "mtv-news", "title": "Bop Shop: Songs From Doechii, Sunmi, The Beths, And More", "text": "The search for the ever-elusive  bop  is difficult.

Can't you see / All this irony / Wanting what we had, but we had what we wanted / Back when we wanted / Back, back when we wanted it.  It's the perfect addition to your summer playlist and an important reminder to appreciate the current moment. --Farah Zermane  Doechii:  Bitch I'm Nice   Doechii's at the height of her career and it's only going up from here. Relishing in her rising stardom, she catwalks through concert venues with witty bars and an infectious beat. Her flourishing, lavish lifestyle is the result of her being one of the most lyrically-engaging rappers in the game right now. --Gwyn Cutler  Jay Park:  Need to Know   2022 has turned out to be Jay Park's renaissance. Following the release of romantic singles  Ganadara  and  Thoughts of You,  the king of K-hip-hop shows fans a different side of himself with  Need to Know,  a breezy R&B track designed to soundtrack a torrid romance. Reuniting with frequent collaborator Cha Cha Malone, Park combines classic '90s-style production elements with his effortlessly dynamic vocals to create a modern love song. The music video is like a rom-com filled with all your favorite tropes (think boomboxes and drive-in movies), and with a melody bound to get stuck in your head,  Need to Know  would be a perfect addition to all your summer playlists. --Sarina Bhutani  Sunmi:  Heart Burn   Feeling summer fever over someone? Sunmi can relate. Unlike most upbeat summer tracks, there is a sentimental and dreamy vibe with its percussion sounds and chimes, summoning the burning magma bubbling through the veins you might experience when starting to feel an attraction and connection with someone.  Oh, my, I'm getting breathless / When you look at me,  she sings hypnotically.  I am getting hot, oh, my! / Is it because of the heat?  It definitely is the heat of passion. --Athena Serrano  The Beths:  Expert in a Dying Field   New Zealand indie-rock quartet The Beths have always had a knack for making love's cruel sting feel a bit softer, thanks to their stunning four-part harmonies, incisive lyrics, and catchy choruses. Their latest offering, which also serves as the title track to their forthcoming album (out September 16), delivers on every level. Over an understated production, lead singer Elizabeth Stokes applies the scientific method to romance, consulting both memory and nature in attempts to make sense of the scars left by past relationships. Perhaps her most astute observation is her least conclusive, as the track builds into buzzing guitars and thrashing drums, and she notes,  Love is learned over time / 'Til you're an expert in a dying field.  --Carson Mlnarik  Yuna:  Risk It All   Yuna's been bitten by the love bug and she's itching to give into its glorious symptoms. Hesitant yet infatuated, Yuna's ready to stake everything to cultivate a romance as soft and natural as a flower's petals and a kitten's fur. Her soothing cadence is bound to lull you into a tranquil stupor that'll have you twirling around starry-eyed in the summer sunshine.  Let me tell you what I've been thinking about,  she sings.  Love is on my mind, yeah I'm freakin' out.  --Gwyn Cutler  Chung Ha:  Sparkling   There's a reason Chung Ha remains one of South Korea's most successful soloists, and her newly released track  Sparkling  is proof. As the first single off her EP Bare and Rare, Pt. 1,  Sparkling  is a high-energy, hyperpop love song that's perfect for summer. The track, which details the emotions of an exciting fling, layers '80s-inspired synths with Chung Ha's clear and powerful vocals for a bop that feels at once retro and contemporary. Accompanied by a pastel-explosion of a music video that takes place under the sea, Chung Ha truly sparkles in a myriad of bedazzled silhouettes, performing lively choreography designed to go viral. With each comeback, Chung Ha prepares an exciting experience for fans, keeping them consistently in anticipation for what's to come next. If  Sparkling  represents all that is Part 1, then we are in for a treat with Part 2, due later this year. --Sarina Bhutani  Jessie Reyez:  Fraud "}, {"source": "medical-news-today", "title": "New form of omega-3 may help prevent visual decline due to Alzheimer's, diabetes", "text": "Share on Pinterest Omega-3 fatty acids may help protect eyes from macular degeneration and visual decline. jef harris/Getty Images Some of the leading causes of sight loss affect the part of the eye called the retina.  Supplementation with a certain type of omega fatty acid known as docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, can reduce the incidence of retinal disease, however, improving DHA levels in the retina is challenging due to the retina-blood barrier.  A group of researchers has now shown that a different form of DHA they have developed can enter the retinal tissue-- at least in mice.  If the same effect is shown in humans, the supplement could be used to reduce risk and potentially even treat some retinal diseases. Loss of sight is believed to have a global cost of $411 billion annually due to medical and care costs, as well as lost work and productivity, according to the World Health Organization . Most people who lose their sight are over the age of 50, and globally the leading causes of vision impairment are: age-related macular degeneration  cataract  diabetic retinopathy  glaucoma  uncorrected refractive errors. Age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy both affect the retina, which is found at the back of the eye and contains many light-sensitive cells which allow us to see. Age-related macular degeneration affects the macula--a part of the retina--and results in central vision being blurred. Meanwhile, diabetic retinopathy is seen in patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is caused by high blood sugar levels affecting blood flow to the retina, and if untreated, can cause blindness. Of all the tissues in the body, the retina and brain have the highest concentration of a certain type of omega-3 fatty acid known as docosahexaenoic acid or DHA. This fatty acid has to be provided through diet or supplementation as the body can only make small amounts of it. While the importance of omega-3 fatty acids in the diet are well known, and epidemiological studies have shown the beneficial effects of DHA supplementation on reducing the risk of development of retinal disease, actually getting this molecule into the retina in order to support normal functioning is much harder. This is because it is challenging to get DHA in the form used for supplements, that cross the intestinal barrier, to also penetrate the blood-retinal barrier . Now, new research offers a ray of hope to treat and possibly prevent visual declines related to Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and other disorders after scientists created a new form of DHA that can cross into the eye's retina. The research was funded by an Alzheimer's Association Research Grant (AARG).  A new form of DHA The group of researchers behind the study were from the University of Illinois at Chicago and presented their data at the annual meeting of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, March 25-28 in Seattle. They showed that a new form of DHA they have developed could be used to cross both the intestinal and retinal blood barrier. To do this, the researchers created a new lysophospholipid form of DHA or LPC-DHA. They gave this supplement to mice at a low dose for 6 months, equivalent to about 250 to 500 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids per day in humans. This resulted in a 100% increase in the amount of DHA found in their retinas. Researchers compared the effect of supplementation with LPC-DHA to other forms of DHA supplementation such as fish oil and krill oil and found it to be superior.  Improved eyesight with DHA Further studies by the team in mice bred to exhibit some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's showed that after six months of daily supplementation with LPC-DHA, these mice exhibited a 96% improvement in retinal DHA levels as well as preserved retinal structure and function. When compared to conventional DHA supplements, they found these had no effect on retinal DHA levels or function in the mice. As this form of DHA has only been tested in mice and not humans, it is unclear whether this LPC-DHA would have the same effect in humans.  Low DHA in Alzheimer's Low levels of DHA have been found in the retinas of individuals with both age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy as well as those with Alzheimer's disease. Dr. Mohammed Zeeshan Afzal, primary care doctor and dermatologist with over 14 years of experience, and medical officer at Welzo, who was not involved in the study, told Medical News Today:  DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is an omega-3 fatty acid that is essential for proper retinal function. DHA levels have been linked to several retinal conditions, including age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP).   Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the blood vessels in the retina. DHA has been shown to have a protective effect on these blood vessels, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress that can contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy,  Dr. Afzal explained. Dr. Barry Sears, founder of the Inflammation Research Foundation, who was also not involved in the study, told MNT that the effect of DHA on inflammation is seen,  virtually all because DHA is the building block required to make certain hormones (resolvins) that are necessary to reduce excess inflammation in the neurons.

Kilito Chan/Getty Images Coffee is a popular beverage commonly consumed by people all over the world.  Researchers are still working to understand coffee's potential health benefits and risks.  Data from a recent study found that drinking coffee is associated with more activity and less sleep.  The study also found that drinking coffee was associated with more premature ventricular contractions, which can pose health risks depending on the person and the severity. A  recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine examined the impact of coffee on several areas of health, including heart arrhythmias, activity level, sleep, and blood sugar. Researchers found that people who drank coffee took more steps on average daily but got slightly less sleep than those who did not drink coffee. Participants who drank coffee had more premature ventricular contractions, a type of extra heartbeat. The research suggests that drinking coffee affects people differently, and people can seek help from specialists for appropriate coffee recommendations.  The health benefits of coffee Coffee is a highly popular beverage around the world. This makes it a common area of interest for research. After all, if many people are drinking it, it seems like a good idea to know how it impacts health. Some research suggests that coffee may be associated with lower mortality risk. It may also help reduce the risk of type two diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer. However, just because coffee poses many potential health benefits does not mean everyone should drink it. How people consume their coffee makes a difference too. Adding cream and sugar can negate some of coffee's potential health benefits . Dr. Chip Lavie, cardiologist and cardiac rehabilitation and prevention director at Ochsner Health, who was not involved in the study, explained to Medical News Today:  Most studies suggest that coffee consumption is associated with better survival, less cardivascular death, lower stroke and heart failure, less chronic hypertension (whereas a very high dose of acute intake can transiently raise blood pressure), and improvements in some risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. These benefits are mostly gathered from large observational studies.   Coffee's effect: More steps, less sleep This particular study looked at heart rhythms, sleep, daily step counts, and blood sugar in relation to coffee consumption. Researchers included 100 healthy adult participants in their analysis, and the study was a randomized trial. The data collection period was two weeks. Participants wore electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors to examine heart rhythms and wore Fitbit devices to track step counts and time asleep. Finally, participants also wore a continuous glucose monitor to keep track of blood sugar levels. Participants were then assigned to either drink coffee for two days or abstain from caffeine for two days. These random assignments continued throughout the fourteen days so that no participant consumed or abstained from coffee for more than two days. Researchers were looking to see if participants had more or less premature atrial contractions on the days they drank coffee. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are extra heartbeats that start in the heart's upper chambers. While sometimes benign, study authors note that PACs may contribute to a more dangerous heart rhythm: atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that drinking coffee was not associated with more PACs. They also found that drinking coffee did not appear to impact blood sugar levels. W hen drinking coffee, participants took an average of about 1,000 steps more daily and got about half an hour less sleep at night. Participants also saw about a 50% increase in premature ventricular contractions on coffee-consumption days. Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are a type of extra heartbeat originating in the heart's lower chambers. However, there did not appear to be a relationship between drinking one cup of coffee and increased PVCs. Study author Dr. Gregory Marcus, cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, explained key findings of the study's results:  Both randomized assignment to consume coffee and the amount of coffee consumed were associated with more premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), substantially more steps taken, and significantly less sleep during the following evening.  However, the results varied among participants, possibly related to how fast they metabolized the caffeine.  Study limitations The study did have limitations. First, the study cannot establish a causal relationship between the factors discussed. Second, it only included a small number of participants, all of whom were healthy, limiting the generalizations of results. Researchers also acknowledge that some results could have been from caffeine withdrawal in participants or factors related to the study not being a blinded study. Researchers were also limited by participant adherence to instructions and the study's methods. For example, the Fitbit devices used were not clinical-grade devices, so the data collection about sleep had limited precision. It is also possible that some of the effects were related to other coffee ingredients and may not be solely attributable to caffeine."}, {"source": "mtv-news", "title": "Harry Styles Breaks Out The Party Pajamas In 'Late Night Talking' Video", "text": "Harry Styles has been doing all this  Late Night Talking,  and he is ready to take you for a ride in his bed -- literally.  The British pop star dropped the new music video for his latest Harry's House hit on Wednesday (July 13), and it begins with Styles dressed in pink and brown pajamas, waking up in an empty bed. He finds his former bedmate's clothes lying on top of an amp speaker. Confused, he looks under the covers and cartoonishly falls inside the mattress. He crawls through the covers in a new blue-brown polka dot set and enters another dimension: a red room with numerous people cuddling and kissing on a supersized bed.   If you're feeling down, I just wanna make you happier, baby,  he sings, popping his head out of the scarlet covers.  Wish I was around, I just wanna make you happier, baby.  Styles wakes up in another bed inside a gallery, this time wearing a tan blazer over his PJs and with various people scrutinizing him as if he were an artwork himself. The next time the bed teleports, Harry is served a meal of spaghetti and meatballs.  I've never been a fan of change,  he sings in the second verse.  But I'd follow you to any place / If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate, I'm coming too.   He can be later seen briefly dining with a man, posing for selfies together. The scene changes to Styles sitting on an intricate baroque bed with a different woman, also taking photos and using binoculars to watch a road engulfed in chaotic traffic. As cars beep, the singer rides on a different bed across the street, enjoying a pillow fight with his friends. Different snippets and photos of him and his friends cuddling and snoozing together appear.  We've been doin' all this late-night talkin',  he sings in the chorus.  'Bout anything you want until the morning / Now you're in my life / I can't get you off my mind.   In the countryside, Styles hosts a book club with two women on a vine-encompassing bed, but a thunderstorm envelopes the sky. As it begins pouring, Styles suddenly disappears, leaving the women perplexed. He and his bed fall from a great height in panic initially but then, to conclude the video and song, Styles relaxes and lies on his back unbothered."}, {"source": "mtv-news", "title": "BTS Will Tell 'A Story Of Our Music' In Disney+ Docuseries and Concert Special", "text": "The boys of BTS are giving you  Permission to Dance  on stage with them on their upcoming new Disney+ specials.

The figure given by the WHO may be an underestimate of the real number of endometriosis cases, since this condition is underdiagnosed, and it can take up to 11 years for a person to receive the correct diagnosis. Excruciating pain is one of the most common symptoms of endometriosis. Indeed, the pain can be so debilitating and unusual in nature that, according to a 2021 report based on data from Britain, both patients and doctors said that the currently used pain rating scale was  insufficient as a standalone tool for communicating endometriosis related pain.  Alderson also noted that it took a long time for her to find a doctor who correctly diagnosed her endometriosis. She already had a diagnosis of PCOS, and had just had an intrauterine device (IUD) put in, when she started experiencing horrible pain, she told Medical News Today in the podcast. For a while, she thought this was a side effect of the IUD, but doctors soon ruled that out. This was the start of a long and convoluted journey to obtain a correct diagnosis. Alderson described her debilitating pain and how difficult the diagnostic process was:  [The pain is] hard to describe -- [it] sort of [extends] from your ovaries to the top of your thighs, going down like scraping metal [...] And so I [initially] thought it must be the coil [IUD], went [to the doctor], got it checked out, had a scan and [the conclusion] was like, 'No, nothing's wrong.' I went to see my [...] family doctor, and then they said [it] could be trapped wind. [...] I was like, 'I really don't think it is.' [I] went away, came back. [...] And then it got to a point where I actually did think I was making it up in my head.  It was only when Alderson started studying to become a nutritionist, learning more about gynecological health conditions, that she found more information about the realities of endometriosis and, through her own research, finally reached a specialist who was able to diagnose her condition correctly. But once the person manages to obtain a correct diagnosis, that is often only the beginning of the even longer search for an effective treatment or symptom management plan.  Current treatment options Currently accepted treatment options are limited, as Dr. Kahleova pointed out:  I mean, you have some painkillers, you know, most of the time they don't work much [for people with endometriosis] [...] Then you have laparoscopy, and are hoping that surgically removing the [endometrial-type] tissues will help. But oftentimes, it [the tissue] comes back. So [surgery is] not a solution, either. So it's kind of like [a] painful journey, just to [obtain an] endometriosis [...] diagnosis in the first place, and with the limited treatment options in the second [place].  Excision surgery is the only way to remove growths of endometrial-like tissue from other organs, but the tissue can grow back, so repeated surgery may be required. Doctors may suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen or naproxen , for pain relief, but these are often ineffective in reducing the severe pain that characterizes endometriosis. Sometimes, doctors may prescribe tranexamic acid, a drug that promotes blood clotting, to help reduce heavy bleeding during periods, but the results are not guaranteed, and the  fix  may often be temporary. Other treatments prescribed for symptom management include hormone therapy , such as birth control pills, or the insertion of an IUD which releases a form of the hormone progesterone, both of which can improve or stop a person's period altogether. However, once again, the result is not guaranteed, and not all people with endometriosis respond to hormone therapy, which may be down to the type of endometrial-like tissue that they have. According to a 2018 study from The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, people with progesterone receptor (PR)-positive lesions tend to respond to progestin, one of the active ingredients in birth control pills, while those with PR-negative lesions have a lower response rate. Cue the search for lifestyle factors that may play a role in the risk of endometriosis and, by extension, could be leveraged to help manage the condition. One of the lifestyle factors that researchers have investigated in relation to endometriosis in recent years is nutrition.  Nutrition and endometriosis risk Our diets have the potential to influence every aspect of our health, so it perhaps comes as no surprise that researchers have been looking at the link between nutrition and endometriosis risk and management. One review of the existing literature published in 2021 found that several dietary items were linked to a heightened risk of endometriosis, including: trans fats, which are a result of the food manufacturing process, which are found in fried and ultra-processed foods, and which increase cholesterol levels, as well as the risk of many health conditions, including diabetes and heart disease  red meat, which may be linked to various health risks depending on the level of consumption  alcohol, which can also contribute to a wide range of other health issues. Dr. Kahleova and her colleagues made similar observations in their review.  [W]hen we look into the studies that have been conducted on diet and endometriosis, we see clear links. So. for example, we see that red meat consumption -- both processed and unprocessed red meat -- increases the risk of endometriosis,  said Dr. Kahleova, adding that  in the prevention and treatment of endometriosis, removing red meat from the diet is the number one dietary recommendation.  She also noted that reducing dairy consumption might help.  [D]airy products [...] increase the estrogen levels, and [they] also contain palmitic acid, which is one of the saturated fatty acids that makes the symptoms worse,  Dr. Kahleova explained. In contrast, some studies have found a protective effect of dairy products -- except butter -- if the intake is of over 21 servings a week, though it is hard to know if relevant confounding factors are linked to such a high dairy consumption.  What dietary changes might help? The 2021 review also found that, when it came to treating and managing endometriosis, polyunsaturated fatty acids -- such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids --  reduce[d] the proliferation of endometriosis lesions both in vivo and in vitro.  Fish, seaweed, and nuts can all be good sources of omega-3, and both Dr. Kahleova and Alderson agreed that adding more of those to the diet can help.  Seaweed has been actually found helpful in women with endometriosis,  Dr. Kahleova noted,  based on [the experience of] just a few women that were in a series of case studies . Only three women were a part of this super small case study series, and consuming seaweed increased the length of their [menstrual] cycle[s], and decreased the length of their periods, and also decreased the symptoms that are associated with painful periods.  Alderson said that her own experience backed what some of these studies have shown.  [I]n terms of my approach [to dietary interventions],  she told us,  red meat consumption is something I definitely didn't do too much of. But I did eat a diet which was more pescatarian. So that would fit into that narrative [that omega-3 fatty acids help].  She also advised that bringing in more vegetables, particularly cruciferous vegetables, legumes, and fruits rich in antioxidants and that are also a good source of fiber can help. A qualitative interview study with 12 people with endometriosis aged 28-44 years, published in BMJ Open in 2020, also suggested that such dietary changes can help improve symptoms. Most of the people interviewed had excluded gluten or decreased its consumption, as well as that of dairy products, and carbohydrate-rich foods. At the same time, the interviewees had increased their fruit, vegetable, and fish consumption, and added dietary supplements, including vitamins, minerals, omega-3, turmeric, and ginger. The interviewees said that after making these dietary changes, their endometriosis-related pain either decreased or disappeared entirely.  Some participants also experienced a decrease in the amount of bleeding and the number of days of bleeding,  the study reports. What is important, in Alderson's view is, essentially,  to create an environment [within the body] where endometriosis wouldn't be able to thrive so well.  However, she also added that this must come  alongside the incredible work the doctor could do  to treat this condition.  Because there's no way I could have solved my situation with diet alone,  she cautioned,  but definitely it's helped.   Potential mechanisms at play So what are the potential mechanisms behind the ways in which diet may interact with symptoms and characteristics of endometriosis? According to Dr. Kahleova and her colleagues' review, several different mechanisms may be at play, depending on the foods under discussion. In the review, they note that reducing dietary fat and increasing dietary fiber can reduce circulating estrogen in the body by 10-25%. This could help with endometriosis symptoms because, according to existing research , people with endometriosis have increased estrogen levels compared to those without, so reducing concentrations of this hormone may be beneficial.  Saturated fat has been shown to increase the risk of endometriosis,  Dr. Kahleova said in the podcast.  And [...] I mentioned that increasing the omega-3s instead of the low-quality fat is definitely helpful. [...] And also if you're eating red meat, that means that you are not eating the foods or are eating less of the foods that may be actually helpful with your endometriosis.  Dr. Kahleova and colleagues' review also found that plant-based diets may be beneficial thanks to their anti-inflammatory potential, and research has repeatedly shown that inflammation plays a role in endometriosis. Indeed, a new study published in March 2023 has found that endometriosis shares some of the genetic characteristics of other chronic pain and inflammatory conditions. Dr. Kahleova and her colleagues also note that vitamin C appears to have the potential to reduce endometriosis symptoms thanks to its antioxidant properties.   One study showed that, for example, in women with endometriosis, when they were supplementing vitamin[s] C and E, not only did their antioxidant levels go up, but their symptoms were actually alleviated by the supplementation,  Dr. Kahleova noted in the podcast."}, {"source": "mtv-news", "title": "ALEXANDER 23'S GENTLE MUSINGS ON THE AFTERSHOCK OF LOVE", "text": "In the three years he's spent working behind the scenes, the artist Alexander 23 has built an impressive resume. As one of the music industry's go-to songwriters and producers, he's collaborated with Olivia Rodrigo, Selena Gomez, and Chelsea Cutler, among others, coining a sound that strikes a chord between sharp lyricism and instrumental melodies.  It all started in Deerfield, Illinois, where Alexander 23, born Alexander Glantz, was raised. He became enamored with music  immediately as I gained consciousness,  he says, which he estimates was in  like, the fifth grade.  Around that time, he played on his elementary school's basketball team, and he enjoyed listening to albums from rock bands like Kansas and Supertramp from beginning to end during the long drives to games. His father helped cultivate that passion, regularly playing the guitar around the house.  Glantz briefly attended the University of Pennsylvania to study engineering but withdrew after a year to focus on music. At 19, he moved to New York and joined an indie band, teaching himself to play bass, piano, drums, and guitar along the way. The group was short-lived and disbanded in 2017. That's when he moved to Los Angeles with only the earnest goal of writing for other artists -- and notably, without a car. He remembers the solo cross-country move as being a strenuous process.  You cannot walk around L.A., which I learned the hard way early on,  Glantz says.  A few expensive Ubers later, I bought a shitty little car.   While he entertained the idea of being a soloist, Glantz initially figured that working behind the scenes would allow for more financial stability. Having become well-versed in production software like Ableton, he landed himself production credits on tracks for pop musicians like AJ Mitchell and Sam Setton. About  five or six months  after moving to California, he decided to take a chance and record songs of his own while continuing to team up with other artists.  Since then, he's released two nine-track EPs, including 2019's I'm Sorry I Love You and Oh No, Not Again! in 2021. His ability to combine live instrumentation with contemporary electronic elements, as well as his knack for describing behaviors for which people often don't have the words, has made him one of the industry's most sought-after collaborators. On Aftershock, his proper full-length debut, he details the process of a harrowing breakup, from the first inklings of doubt to finally closing the chapter, over the course of 11 poignant tracks.   I like to think of it as a one-year-plus-or-minus radius away from a breakup,  Glantz says.  It's about the events leading up to it, the breakup, then getting over it; meeting new people, thinking you're ready to meet new people, and you're not actually ready. You miss her, but you don't miss who you were together. It's definitely a breakup album, which obviously I'm not the first person to do, but I tried to really pull from my specific experience and really get into the nitty gritty and all the nuances that I was feeling.   Aftershock opens with  Hate Me if It Helps,  which sees Glantz unfazed in the midst of his ex's bitterness. On it, he allows his former partner to blame him for the dissolution of their relationship, even if her accounts are false. Co-written by Olivia Rodrigo, for whom he co-produced  Good 4 U,  the track features Glantz questioning the truth of what his ex is telling her friends and family before issuing saccharine apologies on the bridge.  I'm sorry I stayed up with you every night / For making you laugh when you wanted to cry / I'm sorry I paid for your SSRIs,  he sings.  Many fans have found the line to be playfully tongue-in-cheek, but others have taken to social media to say the lyric further stigmatizes mental health issues.  You know, what's funny about that line is I never meant for it to be a large mental health conversation starter,  Glantz says.  I have plenty of songs about that, as well, but I wanted a line in there that felt like something you would regrettably say in the heat of feeling a certain way about someone or a certain situation.   On the excruciatingly self-aware  Crash,  Glantz recounts the painful early stages of the split: changing his ex's name on his phone, dreading Valentine's Day chocolates (which he says now  taste like charcoal ), and recalling texts he typed up but never sent. While he still has love and respect for his ex, he understands that the two of them are no longer meant to be together. He sings,  I miss you, but I don't miss us / 'Cause apart we're great, but together we suck.   Glantz admits that he's learned the hard way that two people, even with the best intentions, can bring out the worst in each other.  The sum of the parts is not always greater,  Glantz notes.  That's something I think people need to learn, especially in more intimate and romantic relationships. It sucks. And I think the fact that it sucks makes you want to fight for it more, which in turn, only makes it worse.   Glantz's music is undoubtedly relatable. His ability to put universal feelings, like the train of thoughts and the behavioral patterns that follow heartbreak, into words has set him apart as a thoughtful young musician in an era of quick, hook-heavy TikTok grabs. Take the punchy, percussion-filled track called  Cosplay,  wherein he describes the moment of realizing that he and his ex were never good for each other. He surmises that they were simply imitating the mannerisms and aesthetics of  each other's exes  from previous relationships.  Perhaps the most powerful track on the collection doesn't pertain to a breakup at all. On the ballad  The Hardest Part,  driven by gentle piano keys and a melancholy guitar riff, Glantz reflects on the loss of a friend. The song's chorus --  the hardest part of getting old, is that some people that you don't love don't  -- evokes a grand feeling of sadness while pointing to the small, intimate moments that make a friendship special. He describes noticing when the  trees turn red  and realizing that he'll never again see the  three dots  that appear as someone is replying to a text message.  While Glantz paints a vivid picture of his friend,  The Hardest Part  also speaks to the grief and loss every one of us has faced in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  This has been the first time where I've had friends start to pass away,  Glantz says.  It's incredibly strange to reconcile. And even when it's not someone who you talk to every day, even if it's losing someone whom you only speak to a few times a year but have a shared childhood and history with, it's really strange to deal with. It hits you on birthdays or coming home for Thanksgiving. Learning how to deal with that emotionally has been a journey.   Over the years, Glantz has opened concerts for several major artists, including Mxmtoon, Omar Apollo, and John Mayer. During a show in Boston, Mayer joined Glantz on stage to perform a cover of Tears for Fears's  Everybody Wants to Rule the World.  Glantz will tour this fall in support of Aftershock, which he says is the  cherry  on top of making music. As a songwriter and producer, he is always satisfied when he can take another artist's song to the next level, but as he prepares to perform his own body of work, he admits to feeling a perfectionist's sense of concern. He knows fans will associate these songs with him forever."}, {"source": "mtv-news", "title": "The 2022 Emmy Nominations Are Here: See The Full List", "text": "The 2022 Emmy Awards will air September 12 on NBC and Peacock, and during a livestream on Tuesday (July 12), comedian JB Smoove and Brooklyn Nine-Nine's Melissa Fumero unveiled this year's nominees.

An increasing amount of scientific evidence now backs up this notion. Recent studies have linked reduced rates of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and cancers with Mediterranean diets. Medical News Today looked at the evidence and spoke to experts about the science behind the benefits of this diet. Share on Pinterest Several recent studies suggest the Mediterranean diet can help keep several diseases and chronic conditions at bay. Image credit: Cameron Whitman/Stocksy. Over the years, many diets have been proposed for keeping healthy or reducing the risk of specific diseases, but few of them have stood up to rigorous scientific scrutiny. One exception, however, appears to be the Mediterranean diet. Increasingly, studies are showing that there are significant health benefits for people who follow this eating plan. Not only has research shown that it reduces cardiovascular disease, but it may also benefit cognition, decrease diabetes risk, reduce the risk of some cancers, and alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis.  What is the Mediterranean diet? The Mediterranean diet is an umbrella term referring to diets based on the historic eating habits of people who live around the Mediterranean Sea. According to the American Heart Association , which recommends this type of diet for cardiovascular health, its key features are: high intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, and legumes  low-fat or fat-free dairy products, fish, poultry, non-tropical vegetable oils, and nuts  limited added sugars, sugary beverages, sodium, highly processed foods, refined carbohydrates, saturated fats, and fatty or processed meats. The Harvard School of Public Health adds to these recommendations, emphasizing the importance of healthy fats -- olive oil, avocados, nuts, and oily fish. It advises that people should eat red meat only occasionally, but get their protein from fish or seafood at least twice a week and eat small quantities of poultry, eggs, and dairy most days. Although water should be a person's main drink, people may also drink one or two small glasses of red wine each day, as per the traditional Mediterranean diet. Researchers add, however, that a healthy diet should also be paired up with some form of enjoyable physical activity every day. Dr. Scott Kaiser, a geriatrician, and director of Geriatric Cognitive Health for the Pacific Neuroscience Institute at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, noted:  Research supports the benefits of adopting healthy lifestyle habits and indicates the critical importance this can play in shaping our future individual and collective health. [...] Start with including lots of fresh vegetables -- especially green leafy vegetables -- and then enjoy fresh fruits-- like berries -- and other antioxidant-rich foods, along with fish, olive oil, and other foods rich in brain-healthy omega-3s.   Why Mediterranean diets are healthy Mediterranean diets have long been associated with benefits to cardiovascular health. In the mid-20th century, the Seven Countries study showed that dietary patterns in the Mediterranean and in Japan in the 1960s were associated with low rates of coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality. Since then, research has shown that this type of diet not only benefits cardiovascular health, but it also reduces the risk of many other health conditions. And recently, evidence has been increasing for the wide-ranging health benefits of following a Mediterranean diet. But what makes Mediterranean diets so healthy, exactly?  The Mediterranean diet is characterized by high fruit and vegetables, high fiber, high levels of 'good fats,' moderate intakes of fish and meat, low amounts of high processed foods and sugary treat foods,  noted Dr. Eamon Laird, a visiting research fellow at Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland.  These food components give high amounts of fiber, good fats, antioxidants, polyphenols, vitamins and minerals -- choline, vitamin C, potassium, B-vitamins, vitamin D from fish, etc. -- [and] proteins which give health benefits throughout a large number of organ and tissue systems,  he explained.  Mediterranean diet and CVD Lots of research has investigated the effect of a Mediterranean diet on the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A meta-analysis of several studies published in March 2023, with a pooled sample of more than 700,000 female participants, has found that, by adhering closely to a Mediterranean diet, women reduced their risk of CVD by 24%, and their risk of death from any cause by 23%. According to Dr. Laird,  [w]omen are also much more likely to stick with the diet compared to men, which could explain why we see more of the health benefits in women.  The meta-analysis seems to confirm the findings of previous research. For example, in 2015, another meta-analysis had found that the Mediterranean diet could be a major factor in preventing CVD. And it was the complete diet, rather than any particular aspect, that seemed to have this effect, as Dr. Joanna Hodges, an assistant teaching professor of nutritional sciences at Pennsylvania State University, told MNT.  [The study] concludes that no specific component of the Mediterranean diet has been shown to be as beneficial as the whole diet [in CVD prevention],  she told us.  Mediterranean diet and cognitive health There is also increasing evidence that the diet may enhance cognitive function. A study published in March 2023 that used UK Biobank data has just reported that individuals with a higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet had up to 23% lower risk for dementia compared with those who had lower adherence to a Mediterranean diet. The study, which used data from more than 60,000 people, concluded that the Mediterranean diet lowered dementia risk even in those with a genetic predisposition for dementia. The authors conclude that adopting a diet high in healthy, plant-based foods may be a strategy for reducing dementia risk. Another study, also published in March 2023, which looked at postmortem Alzheimer's pathology, found that those who had followed a Mediterranean or MIND diet, particularly one rich in leafy greens, had a much lower beta-amyloid load. Beta-amyloid is thought to be responsible for many of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The diet may also be beneficial for people with multiple sclerosis (MS). A preliminary study to be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 75th Annual Meeting in April 2023, found that people with MS who followed a Mediterranean diet had a 20% lower risk of cognitive impairment than those who followed it the least.  Mediterranean diet and cancer The diet has been found to both reduce the risk of some cancers and improve the efficacy of some cancer treatments. A 2019 review found that high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a lower rate of several cancers, including breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. This study concluded that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of components of the diet  prevent and counteract DNA damages and slow down the development of various forms of cancer.  For prostate cancer, recent research has shown that eating a diet high in colorful fruits and vegetables both reduces the risk of developing prostate cancer and speeds recovery in those who undergo radiation therapy for the disease. The studies, from South Australia, found that diets high in lycopene and selenium reduced the risk. Tomatoes, melons, papayas, grapes, peaches, watermelons, and cranberries are rich in lycopene, and white meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, and nuts contain high concentrations of selenium. All of these are recommended in the Mediterranean diet. And it is not only prostate cancer patients whose treatment may be more effective on a Mediterranean diet. A recent study presented at UEG Week 2022 found that the diet was significantly associated with an improved response to immunotherapy drugs in people with advanced melanoma.  How it works Although the exact mechanism by which the Mediterranean diet benefits health is unclear, there is increasing evidence that the diet can have five main effects : lowering lipids  protecting against oxidative stress, inflammation, and platelet aggregation  modifying hormones and growth factors involved in cancer pathogenesis  restricting specific amino acids  influencing the gut microbiome to produce metabolites that benefit metabolic health. Dr. Laird explained to MNT how some components of the diet benefit health:  Omega-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, resveratrol , vitamins, and polyphenols may contribute to lower levels of inflammation ( CRP , inflammatory cytokines ), and may improve endothelial function. By reducing levels of inflammation, improving blood flow, improving insulin sensitivity, and improving lipid metabolism, by default you are also reducing some of the major risk factors for CVD, cognitive decline, cancers, and diabetes.  Studies have found that it is best to take in these nutrients in their natural form as part of a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet. Although they can be obtained through supplements, there may be side effects to taking excessive amounts."}, {"source": "mashable", "title": "How to make iPhone's Screen Time actually helpful", "text": "Your iPhone is keeping track, but is it enough?  It's been a year since Apple introduced a new feature to its iOS settings:  Screen Time,  the activity and phone use tracker.  Since updating to iOS 12 and beyond, we've been getting daily and weekly reports on our phone with data on mobile usage to help us set limits on how long we can endlessly scroll through Instagram or Twitter. Apple CEO Tim Cook has even used Screen Time to flaunt his company's questionable anti-phone stance.  But since its introduction to our iPhone-filled lives, Screen Time has been lacking. It promised us salvation from our phone addiction (by telling you that you picked up your phone 127 times on Saturday) but it's become just another data point. It's nice to have all this information, but Apple doesn't offer much to actually do to with it.  Ahead of this year's big Apple developer conference WWDC next week, here are some ideas and suggestions to improve Screen Time. Maybe we'll actually get off our phones this year. Probably not.  Screen Time tells you what you're doing on your iPhone. Credit: apple  Cheater, cheater!  Screen Time lets you set time limits(Opens in a new tab) on all (or none of) your apps if you want, or you can pick and choose which types of apps you can only use for a set amount of time. I give myself 15 minutes of daily screen time on my iPhone 6 for all games and social networking apps.  But when my 15 minutes are up, I inevitably keep giving myself more time to look at friends' status updates on Facebook. A pop-up notifies me that I've reached my limit, but I can add 15 more minutes, an hour, or even all-day access to that app. Basically I'm given an option to cheat on my Screen Time limits.  It's so easy to cheat. Credit: sasha lekach / mashable  I knowingly give myself more time and appreciate Apple calling out that I didn't stick to my strict 15 minutes, but once I give in to more time wasted there aren't any consequences, really. That's it. I have to punch in my personal Screen Time passcode to approve the extra time, and then it's never spoken of again.  Apple needs to get a bit tougher on this front, at least in the weekly report overviewing how many minutes and pickups you racked up and which apps and categories you overindulged in. It should include that you extended your limit 45 times this week here, or flag that you have a problem when it comes to sticking to your time limit on certain apps. Something, anything that makes us think a little harder before we click  approve all day.   Limited history  When it comes to gauging how you've responded to an overt amount of phone usage, you can either see how your phone addiction is faring from the same day or from the past week. There's not much customization or analysis beyond those two options within the feature. It's time to see how we're doing over different time periods, especially if it's a weird week while you're on vacation.  For those of us actually trying to modify our behaviors around our phones, it's a process that takes weeks and months. We should be able to get a better sense of how we're using our phone over time. Change doesn't just happen in a week.  Let's get specific  This tweet below may be tongue-in-cheek - wanting Screen Time to tell you super specific actions you've taken - but it's not that big of an ask. Screen Time keeps things broad and general, breaking down what types of apps you use (productivity, reading, games, etc.) and then listing the ones you use the most.  But if you were reading a massive New Yorker piece on Twitter, it feels like you should get some time back compared to mindless  liking  on Instagram. Right? What you're doing within different apps carries different weight.  So what?  Screen Time is rife with missed opportunities. Every Sunday I get a notification flagging my  Weekly Report Available.  This week I was told my screen time was down 17 percent compared to the previous week. That's great, and I'm proud of myself.  But where do we go from here? Apple educates me on my usage and behaviors, but doesn't do much to help me enact a plan utilizing said information. Can I graduate to a more stringent version of Screen Time? Or if I  performed  poorly this week and was up 17 percent instead of down maybe I should lose my  approve for an hour  privileges? Just some ideas.  As others have pointed out, Screen Time data should be usable data. In the tweet above, this educator wants to be able to use the Screen Time data in other Apple programs. As is, it sits within your iPhone settings and can't be exported or really shared for deeper analysis or other accountability purposes.  Screen Time might be a good start, but it needs to expand and get tougher if Apple really wants us to get off our phones."}, {"source": "mashable", "title": "AOC opens up about death threats after baseball team shows offensive video of her", "text": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez opened up about death threats on Twitter following a troubling video from a minor league baseball team.

Trump and Biden are hoping it's them.  Donald Trump's re-election campaign has been pouring money into Facebook ads, particularly those targeting older women, according to Facebook data (Opens in a new tab)recently highlighted by the New York Times(Opens in a new tab). There's only one candidate who can hold a candle to the Trump campaign's Facebook spending: Joe Biden.  Thanks to Facebook's Ad Library, anyone is able to see just how much cash each campaign is spending on Facebook, what kind of ads they're buying, and who those ads are reaching. This year, President Trump's campaign has spent about $5 million on Facebook ads. Not until mid-March did all twenty-freaking-two of the democratic candidates combine to spend as much as Trump on Facebook advertising.  Now, Trump isn't the only candidate relying heavily on the social network. Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden outspent Trump on Facebook in May, giving Zuck enterprises $1.1 million, compared to about $940,000.  Their ads both feature (relatively) dashing images of the 70-year-old men, but substantively, couldn't be more different. Biden's ads saber rattle about tax cuts for the ultra wealthy, while Trump's ads have more recently been asking viewers to wish the president a happy birthday, or to get a signed MAGA hat.  One thing does look very similar: the extent to which they're wooing women over 45.   Older people are more likely to vote than younger folks, and both Biden and Trump both know that women are key to winning in 2020,  Jane Hughes, a director at Democratic communications agency Bully Pulpit Interactive, said.  According to Bully Pulpit's analysis, Biden is targeting a whopping 82 percent of his Facebook ads to people over 45. Trump is allocating 75 percent for the same.  45 - 64 year olds are SO lucky. Credit: Bully Pulpit Interactive  Joe is also apparently wooing the demographic made famous by Leslie Knope on Parks and Recreation: women who love Joe Biden. The audience for his ads was more than 65 percent women.  Ads for the  Nobody has more respect for women than I do  president skewed 56 percent female.  Um, who's impinging on MEN'S RIGHTS now? (NB: men's rights is not a thing). Credit: bully pulpit interactive  As the Times points out, white women in particular are an important demographic for Trump. They helped swing the election the president's way in 2016, and in 2018 the same demographic helped usher in a blue tsunami in the House. Furthermore, while there aren't a disproportionate amount(Opens in a new tab) of U.S. women on Facebook, they are among the most active Facebook users, according to Bully Pulpit. And in the political arena, it's not clear who the majority of this demographic will back.   White women are catching up with women of color who have a long history of supporting Democrats,  Hughes said.  Biden, who faces a primary field of talented and qualified woman opponents, is looking to seize that momentum. Trump, whose party is facing backlash for unprecedented abortion bans in states across the country, is trying to pull women back in his direction.   Other candidates are also going after the same demographic. But Biden is outspending Kamala Harris - his closest competitor, in terms of Facebook ad dollars -- two to one.  In the past, candidates hoped to reach voters who voted based on network news. But the Trump campaign showed how Facebook's microtargeted ads could be a powerful way to reach voters in unprecedented ways.

He gives them a safe space surrounded by others as fragile as they are so they can regain their sense of self.  When he's captured by Mr. Nobody (Alan Tudyk) at the start of the season, the group is forced to move from fragile co-existence to co-dependence, throwing them into disarray as they contemplate facing the outside world without The Chief's guidance and support.  During the team's first excursion away from the mansion, Larry (Matt Bomer), wrapped in bandages head-to-toe to hide his burned skin, anxiously stares out from the safety of the team's bus. He hadn't left the mansion in years, and going out into society was never his strong suit to begin with. He gathers his courage and makes a move.  It's a process I'm very familiar with.  Doom Patrol -- Ep. 101 --  Pilot  Credit: Jace Downs / Warner Bros. Entertainment  When I was a teenager, I was bullied to the point of becoming suicidal. Starting as a friend's boyfriend, my bully tore through my social circle in a violent haze of entitlement and adolescent rage over the course of a year, with me one of his main victims. I'd miss school because he was waiting outside my mom's apartment to attack me. He'd send menacing texts and turn any interaction into an attempt at coercion. I'm still not sure why I became one of his foremost targets. I think a lack of self-esteem just made me easy prey. He knew he could, so he did.  Doom Patrol is a superhero show that understands that the longest, greatest battles we face are against ourselves.  Most of the Doom Patrol's squad are products of questionable decisions, unfair choices and some astonishingly bad luck. Cliff's (Brendan Fraser) adultery tore his family apart, the fateful crash that made him a brain in a robot suit tragically occurring as he and his wife were starting to reconcile. Rita (April Bowlby) may have been hard-nosed and manipulative, but she was playing by the patriarchal rules of classic Hollywood. Larry was living a double-life because being a successful Air Force pilot and queer were incompatible with each other in the 1960s.  Traumatic events can leave us wishing we'd done things differently, blaming ourselves within warped perceptions of who we even are anymore. There isn't always a better choice, and victims are not to blame for the behavior of abusers. I wasn't the nicest person, I'd a selfish streak not unlike Rita's, but that doesn't make what happened right or excuse the friends that sat idly by.  Ah, lads, be friends,  one quipped after I was told to kill myself. They probably didn't think he was being serious, but I knew he was, and I have their indifference as mentally ingrained as anything my bully did.  He assaulted me twice - once punching me to the ground outside the local girl's high-school when I lost my temper with him, and again at a Blink-182 concert three years later. Finding me in the audience, he blamed me for him ending up in prison and elbowed me twice in the face so hard it broke the skin. I still have the scar.  I'd considered fighting back that second time. I decided against it in the moment because I figured if I let him do what he was going to do he'd stop. I've seen him twice in the nine years since then, and despite him shouting to make sure I saw him, he hasn't laid another finger on me.  Doom Patrol -- EP 108 --  Danny Patrol  Credit: Bob Mahoney / Warner Bros. Entertainment  What makes the Doom Patrol remarkable is that, when we first meet them, they're people similarly downtrodden. They're broken and beaten down, taking life day by day with as little discomfort as possible, trying to get used to these weird powers they've been cursed with. Existence has become its own kind of morose punishment for who they were.  Their triumph -- their heroism -- is in the slow march towards accepting that what they've become doesn't lessen who they are and deciding to face their demons, and Mr. Nobody, regardless of the outcome. If it all goes wrong, well at least they tried, and did so on their terms.  Nowadays, I've become used to the tinge of fear when I leave the house. Most times I shrug it off, like Larry leaving that bus. But some days are like Jane (Diane Guerrero) defiantly screaming at the massive internal projection of her abusive father in  Jane Patrol.  Others, I'm too exhausted to bother. Doom Patrol is a superhero show that understands that the longest, greatest battles we face are against ourselves.  Our disparate protagonists resist connection because solitude is comfortable when living with this kind of anguish. Vulnerability might lead to people wanting to talk about it, like Cliff does to Jane after seeing the underground, and that means risking more manipulation and heartache. But being alone eventually becomes a cage from which you watch the rest of the world with only your pain for company.  I feel Jane's level of discomfort, though not quite with the same animosity. This piece, in itself, is an exercise in rebutting my own secrecy and making what happened to me known. Silence only favors the oppressive, and I am tired of keeping myself down.   I assure you there are many monsters in this world, and none of them, not a one, is you,  Dr. Caulder tells Cliff in the opening episode. Perhaps Doom Patrol's most heroic accomplishment is making one believe that that just might be true."}, {"source": "les-echos", "title": "EXCLUSIF - Les tarifs vont augmenter de plus de 7 % pour les hopitaux", "text": "Par Solenn Poullennec  Publie le 30 mars 2023 a 18:50 Mis a jour le 31 mars 2023 a 6:55  Les hopitaux et cliniques vont enfin y voir plus clair sur leur trajectoire financiere.

Quatre ans apres les Assises de l'eau, un an apres le Varenne agricole de l'eau, ses grandes ambitions seront-elles davantage suivies d'effets que par le passe ? Les professionnels veulent y croire. Le fait qu'il ait ete presente ce jeudi par Emmanuel Macron est juge comme un signal positif - meme si le chef de l'Etat souhaitait sans doute aussi detourner l'attention de la reforme des retraites.  << C'est un message fort ! >> reagit Nicolas Garnier, delegue general de l'association Amorce, qui represente les collectivites locales. << L'eau est un sujet fondamental, mais pas assez politise. >> La secheresse de l'ete 2022 a certainement aussi contribue a propulser le sujet sur le devant de la scene. << Aucun des scenarios scientifiques sur le climat ne nous dit que la situation va s'ameliorer >>, a insiste Emmanuel Macron dans son discours.  Nouveaux moyens  Grande difference avec les initiatives precedentes, ce << plan >> prevoit de debloquer de nouveaux moyens pour les agences de l'eau. Car la gestion de l'eau reste avant tout du ressort des collectivites locales - et le chef de l'Etat a confirme qu'il n'etait pas question de revenir sur cette organisation : ce sont notamment les redevances prelevees par les agences de l'eau qui permettent aux collectivites d'engager des investissements de long terme.  Le chef de l'Etat a annonce une augmentation globale des moyens des agences de l'eau de 475 millions d'euros par an. Leur plafond de depenses sera supprime.  Les redevances, aujourd'hui essentiellement prelevees sur les particuliers, seront augmentees et pourraient etre elargies aux autres consommateurs d'eau, industriels et agriculteurs. << Un tel elargissement rapporterait 1,2 milliard d'euros >>, a calcule Nicolas Garnier. De quoi mettre en oeuvre une nouvelle politique de l'eau reellement ambitieuse.  Economiser 10 %  Le plan elabore par le ministere de la Transition ecologique en collaboration avec celui de l'Agriculture, qui comporte au total 53 mesures, vise a la sobriete : il prevoit un objectif global de reduction des prelevements d'eau de 10 % d'ici a 2030. L'energie, l'industrie, l'agriculture et le tourisme seront concernes.  Dans l'industrie, il s'agit d'etudier les economies possibles des 50 sites les plus consommateurs d'eau. Dans l'energie, le gouvernement va demander a EDF d'engager un travail sur les centrales electriques (nucleaire et hydroelectricite) pour reduire leurs consommations. L'agriculture sera elle aussi mise a contribution : il lui sera demande de stabiliser ses prelevements, ce qui represente en soi un effort dans un contexte de rechauffement climatique.  Lire aussi : DECRYPTAGE Pour faire face aux secheresses, la France se tourne vers les eaux usees  Les particuliers seront eux aussi sollicites. Le gouvernement lancera comme prevu avant l'ete une campagne de sensibilisation a destination du grand public. Emmanuel Macron a aussi confirme la mise en place d'ici a l'ete d'un << Ecowatt de l'eau >>, qui permettra de connaitre la situation de chaque territoire et les mesures adaptees dans chacun d'entre eux. Ce sont les prefets qui decident des restrictions a engager dans chaque departement, en fonction de la situation hydrique locale. Les particuliers devraient aussi etre aides pour l'installation de dispositifs permettant d'utiliser les eaux de pluie, par exemple, << en fonction des besoins sur les territoires >>.  Plus generalement, tous les projets relatifs a l'utilisation de l'eau devront etre montes via des schemas d'amenagement et de gestion de l'eau. << En posant des objectifs par acteur, ces schemas permettront de responsabiliser tout le monde >>, estime Nicolas Garnier.  Tarification progressive  L'Etat prevoit aussi de rendre possible toute une serie de mesures, qui restent du ressort des collectivites locales. Il compte ainsi << faciliter >> la tarification progressive de l'eau, qui consisterait a augmenter fortement les prix au-dela d'un certain volume consomme - de sorte a penaliser le remplissage des piscines ou le lavage des voitures, par exemple.  Il veut egalement inciter les communes a s'attaquer aux problemes des fuites , qui representent en France 20 % de l'eau potable entrant dans les reseaux de distribution, et developper la reutilisation des eaux usees, qui sortent des stations d'epuration et sont aujourd'hui rejetees dans la nature.

Emmanuel Macron est ce jeudi dans les Hautes-Alpes, sur les bords du lac de Serre-Poncon, a Savines-le-Lac. Ce lac est la plus grande reserve d'eau douce d'Europe de l'Ouest, mais son taux de remplissage s'est nettement affaibli ces dernieres annees avec la baisse des precipitations. Depuis ce lieu, le president a d'abord ete accueilli aux sons des protestations de manifestants. << C'est au plus pres du terrain qu'on peut gerer la repartition des ressources >>, a repondu Emmanuel Macron.  << Nous aurons entre 10 % et 40 % d'eau en moins dans les annees a venir >>, a ensuite alerte Christophe Bechu, ministre de la Transition ecologique. Pour faire face a cette nouvelle donne, le gouvernement devoile un << plan de sobriete sur l'eau >> en 53 mesures pour preparer l'ete 2023 et, a plus long terme, planifier la gestion de l'eau jusqu'en 2030.

Dans chaque territoire, les prefets vont fixer des regles de partage de l'eau pour chacun.  Par ailleurs, Emmanuel Macron a annonce que, comme avec l'energie, << chaque secteur devra mettre en place un plan de sobriete : celui de l'energie du tourisme, de l'agriculture... >>, a-t-il annonce.  Le but est de baisser les prelevements d'eau douce de 10 % dans tous les secteurs d'ici 2030  Lutte contre les fuites  Le gouvernement va aussi s'attaquer au gaspillage de l'eau. L'objectif est de reduire les fuites qui representent 20 % des volumes d'eau potable et peuvent monter a 50 % dans certaines communes, a deplore le president. Ainsi, << pour accompagner les territoires les plus vulnerables, on a debloque en urgence 180 millions d'euros, renouvele chaque annee >>, a-t-il lance.

Une enveloppe de 35 millions d'euros sera debloquee dans les Outre-mer.  << On va lancer un grand plan sur nos infrastructures >>, a ajoute le president. Il a notamment evoque une modernisation des reseaux avec des compteurs intelligents << pour organiser la sobriete au plus pres du terrain >>.  Reutilisation des eaux usees  Le president a aussi annonce une reutilisation des eaux usees facilitee. Aujourd'hui, << moins de 1 % des eaux sont reutilisees en France mais on peut faire dix, quinze, vingt fois mieux >>, estime Emmanuel Macron. << On veut passer a 10 % de reutilisation des eaux usees d'ici a 2030 >>, annonce-t-il, soit un volume de 300 millions de metres cubes. Pour cela, << on va lancer 1.000 projets en 5 ans. On a des femmes et des hommes sur notre territoire qui savent le faire >>, lance-t-il.  Transformation de l'agriculture  Dans le secteur agricole << toutes les nouvelles installations devront etre adaptees au changement climatique avec des diagnostics eau, sols et adaptation integres aux aides a l'installation >>, precise le president. << Il faudra reinventer des territoires agricoles car le systeme climatique change et nous devons adapter nos cultures >>, ajoute-t-il.  Ainsi, pour faire evoluer le stockage de l'eau, un fonds de 30 millions d'euros sera deploye pour financer des techniques qui favorisent la recharge des nappes . << Il faut tout faire pour reduire l'irrigation >>, estime le president. Par ailleurs, les agences de l'eau disposeront chaque annee de 500 millions d'euros supplementaires.  Tarification progressive de l'eau  Le president a annonce que la tarification de l'eau va evoluer.

Le secretaire d'Etat au Travail et aux Retraites, Mel Stride, a annonce jeudi au parlement que l'entree en vigueur de la retraite a 68 ans ne serait pas acceleree, comme le gouvernement britannique avait pu un temps l'envisager.  La generation nee a partir d'avril 1977 sera la premiere a travailler jusqu'a 68 ans, avant de pouvoir toucher sa retraite d'Etat. Le gouvernement avait envisage d'appliquer cette mesure a partir des generations nees a la fin des annees 1960, mais a finalement renonce dans un contexte de crise du pouvoir d'achat et de forte inflation.  << Depuis la derniere evaluation de 2017, les gains en esperance de vie ont ralenti, a justifie Mel Stride. C'est une tendance observee a des degres varies dans un certain nombre de pays developpes. >> Si l'esperance de vie en retraite est moins longue que prevu, le besoin de faire des economies sur le systeme de retraite est donc moins pressant.  Sujet peu sensible  Au Royaume-Uni, l'age de la retraite n'est pas un sujet sensible politiquement comme en France. D'ou le fait que ces annonces aient lieu dans le cadre des debats quotidiens de la Chambre des communes, dans une relative indifference. Depuis une reforme de 2014, le gouvernement decide du calendrier de report de l'age legal sur la base d'un rapport d'experts. Ce rapport, dont la derniere version datait de 2017, vient d'etre mis a jour.  A cette occasion, Mel Stride a annonce que l'age legal serait bien porte de 66 a 67 ans entre 2026 et 2028. Mais il a remis la decision de report a 68 ans a une nouvelle evaluation qui sera publiee d'ici a deux ans, soit apres les prochaines elections legislatives.  Cette decision concerne uniquement la pension versee par l'Etat, qui n'est qu'une composante de la retraite des Britanniques, basee en grande partie sur la capitalisation. Au Royaume-Uni, moins de la moitie des revenus des retraites provient de cette retraite d'Etat et des prestations sociales. Son montant est d'environ 185 livres par semaine (soit 900 euros par mois) pour toute personne ayant cotise au moins 35 ans.  Le reste de leurs revenus vient de fonds de pension abondes par les employeurs ou auxquels les Britanniques ont volontairement cotise. Ils peuvent ainsi arreter leur activite professionnelle avant l'age legal et toucher les revenus de leur fonds de pension.  Par comparaison, les retraites francais retirent plus de 80 % de leurs revenus de la pension versee par la Securite sociale. Cette difference fait que le poids des depenses publiques de retraite frole les 15 % du PIB en France, alors qu'il est inferieur a 5 % du PIB au Royaume-Uni. Le Royaume-Uni se caracterise aussi par un taux de pauvrete bien plus eleve chez les plus de 66 ans, a 15,5 %, contre moins de 5 % en France.  Inegalites d'esperance de vie  Si la retraite a 68 ans ne fait pas tellement polemique de l'autre cote de la Manche, les raisons qui ont pousse le gouvernement a temporiser soulevent un debat sur les inegalites d'esperance de vie.  << La pauvrete rend les gens davantage malades et les fait mourir plus tot. Et les progres en termes d'esperance de vie ralentissaient deja avant la pandemie >>, a lance Jonathan Ashworth, le depute travailliste specialiste des retraites, citant en exemple l'ecart d'esperance de vie de neuf ans entre certains endroits de Manchester et le quartier londonien huppe de Chelsea.

Alors qu'une secheresse historique s'annonce pour cet ete avec des nappes phreatiques au plus bas, des communes se mobilisent pour une meilleure repartition de l'indispensable ressource. Le ministre de l'Environnement devoilera son << plan eau >> ce jeudi mais des territoires n'ont pas attendu les mesures d'Etat pour experimenter des solutions.  En effet, face a une rarefaction de la ressource, les conflits autour de l'eau s'intensifient, a l'image de celui autour des mega-bassines de Sainte-Soline dans les Deux-Sevres qui oppose agriculteurs et riverains et ecologistes. Deja l'ete dernier, des conflits autour de la ressource avaient eclate partout en France : des golfs, des piscines, des retenues d'eau a usage recreatif... avaient ete pris pour cible. Pour eviter ces conflits et mieux preserver la ressource, des elus ont d'ores et deja pris des mesures.  1. La fin des permis de construire  Un choix radical : neuf communes du pays de Fayence, dans le Var, ont decide de ne plus autoriser, ou presque, de nouvelles constructions. << C'est une decision difficile que nous ne prenons pas de gaite de coeur >>, souligne Francois Cavallier, maire de Callian, une des communes concernees. << Mais il est inconcevable pour nous de faire venir de nouveaux habitants en leur disant qu'il n'y a plus d'eau au robinet >>, ajoute l'edile.  Les elus de la communaute de communes qui comptent 31.000 habitants ont donc collectivement decide << de limiter la croissance demographique sur les 5 prochaines annees a 0,5 % >>, souligne Francois Cavallier. << Une situation de quasi-gel des permis de construire >>, martele l'edile.  Lire aussi : Secheresse : des communes gelent les permis de construire  << C'est une decision historique qui met en lumiere le fait que, sans eau, la construction n'est plus possible >>, souligne Emma Haziza, hydrologue. D'ailleurs, l'Etat lui-meme a pris des decisions comparables comme en Ardeche ou le prefet a interdit la delivrance des permis de construire dans 22 communes. La decision est temporaire nuance toutefois Thierry Devimeux, prefet de l'Ardeche.  Mais ces decisions s'exposent aussi a des contentieux. La loi n'est pas assez claire : << On a d'un cote la loi Alur qui pousse a une pression urbanistique et de l'autre des ressources insuffisantes qui ne nous permettent plus d'accueillir de nouveaux habitants >>, precise Francois Cavallier. << La jurisprudence devra trancher >>, explique Arnaud Gossement, avocat en droit de l'environnement.  2. L'interdiction de construire des piscines  D'autres maires ont pris des decisions comparables. Ainsi, Gerardmer (Vosges) a decide de ne plus autoriser de permis de construire a plus de 700 m d'altitude, juste au-dessus du celebre lac de Gerardmer situe a 650 m. De fait, l'ete dernier, la station touristique la plus frequentee du massif avait ete victime de secheresse et de surfrequentation, au point de se retrouver en penurie d'eau potable debut aout. Elle avait du s'approvisionner dans le lac. La << perle des Vosges >> a egalement decide de ne plus autoriser la construction de nouvelle piscine.  Face au deficit d'eau dans les Pyrenees-Orientales, le maire d'Elne a egalement interdit toute construction de piscine et tout nouveau forage dans la nappe phreatique de la part de particuliers raccordes au reseau. L'arrete municipal court du 7 mars jusqu'au 30 avril au moins. Le maire (PC) Nicolas Garcia estime qu'il << faut faire fleche de tout bois pour economiser la ressource et marquer les esprits. C'est vital ! >>, s'insurge l'elu sur son blog.  3. Une tarification progressive  Meme probleme a Montpellier mais une solution differente a ete deployee. Depuis le debut de l'annee 2023, la ville a choisi de tester une tarification de l'eau progressive. Autrement dit, au-dela d'une certaine quantite d'eau consommee, le prix du metre cube d'eau augmente. Le but est evidemment d'inciter les habitants a reduire leur consommation d'eau.  Concretement, dans les 14 communes de la metropole de Montpellier, les particuliers recoivent 15 metres cubes d'eau gratuitement par an. Ensuite, le tarif est progressif. Ainsi jusqu'a 120 metres cubes supplementaires, le tarif s'eleve a 95 centimes d'euros par metre cube puis de 120 metres cubes a 240 metres cubes, le cout est de 1,40 euro, et au-dela de 240 metres cubes c'est 2,60 euros le metre cube.   La Metropole fait le choix de proposer la tarification eco-solidaire pour lutter contre le gaspillage   Les abonnes de la @RegiedeseauxM3M disposant d'un compteur individuel beneficient d'une tarification progressive de leur consommation d'eau avec les 15 premiers m3 gratuits pic.twitter.com/TiVHnAU3mx -- Montpellier3m (@Montpellier3m) January 6, 2023  Le but est ainsi de decourager les plus gros consommateurs d'eau et d'inciter les usagers a plus de sobriete. Les proprietaires de piscines sont aussi clairement en ligne de mire. A l'inverse, la metropole assure que les foyers les plus modestes et les moins consommateurs d'eau verront leur facture diminuer. << Une aide << eau solidaire >> sera versee pour les foyers aux revenus les plus modestes a partir de l'automne 2023 >>, annonce ainsi la regie.  4. La reutilisation des eaux usees  En Vendee, la presqu'ile vendeenne de Noirmoutier a ete pionniere dans la reutilisation de ses eaux usees. Depuis 40 ans, cette eau recyclee est distribuee gratuitement aux agriculteurs. << Grace a cela, les agriculteurs ne consomment plus un tiers de l'eau potable de l'ile comme avant >>, confie Nicolas Paille, responsable de la cooperative.  En France, moins de 1 % des eaux usees retraitees sont reutilisees. << C'est dix fois plus en Italie, vingt fois plus en Espagne, cent fois plus en Israel ! >>, rappelle regulierement le ministre de la Transition ecologique, Christophe Bechu qui se mobilise pour deployer cette solution.  Aujourd'hui en France, les eaux usees retraitees sont principalement rejetees dans la nature. De fait, les collectivites locales n'en avaient pas reellement eu besoin jusqu'a present. La situation change mais la reutilisation des eaux usees, (<< reut >>, dans le jargon des professionnels), reste encore tres encadree et couteuse.  Lire aussi : DECRYPTAGE Pour faire face aux secheresses, la France se tourne vers les eaux usees  La << reut >> est rentable si elle se substitue a de l'eau potable, comme a Noirmoutier. Mais pour les agriculteurs qui prelevent l'eau dans le milieu naturel, la << reut >> est bien plus couteuse. Par ailleurs, ce n'est pas une solution miracle car les eaux rejetees par les stations d'epuration sont aussi indispensables pour alimenter les cours d'eau et permettre les usages en aval.  5. La lutte anti-fuite  Depuis que l'eau se fait rare, les nombreuses fuites sur le reseau de distribution d'eau potable sont pointees du doigt. Contre ce gaspillage, la ville de Valence se mobilise de longue date. Cette commune de la Drome a ainsi choisi de renouveler ses canalisations regulierement, sans attendre les fuites pour le faire. Elle a egalement installe des capteurs d'eau pour detecter les fuites au plus vite et les localiser precisement pour les reparer sans attendre.  Lire aussi : Les nappes phreatiques toujours trop basses en France malgre la pluie  Resultat, la ville peut se targuer de l'un des taux de fuite le plus faible de France, 15 % contre 20 % en moyenne en France. Ce taux est evidemment bien plus eleve dans les communes rurales ou des kilometres de canalisation sont necessaires a l'alimentation des habitations.  Alors que l'eau se fera de plus en plus rare avec le rechauffement climatique, les communes vont devoir trouver des solutions. Les 117 communes ayant du acheminer de l'eau potable par camion-citerne l'ete dernier sont a pied d'oeuvre. Tout comme l'Etat qui va finalement presenter son plan eau ce jeudi. A moins que d'autres priorites ne fassent une nouvelle fois passer la gestion de la precieuse ressource au second plan."}, {"source": "goteborgs-posten", "title": "Kvinnor blir nio ar aldre i Eriksberg an i Bergsjon", "text": "Goteborgs-Posten ar som bast nar du ar inloggad.

Man kan ha synpunkter pa att kommunen valjer att mata sig efter polisens klassificering av olika omraden - eftersom den utgar fran de problem just polisen upplever, som hur hog brottsligheten ar och hur latt eller svart det ar att fa folk dar att delta i rattsprocessen.  Som bland andra forskaren Tapio Salonen pekat pa finns det andra - och kanske for en kommun viktigare - satt att mata hur ett omrade mar. Genom att utga fran polisens lista tvingas kommunen dessutom slass mot foreteelser den overhuvudtaget inte kan ra pa, eftersom det ar polisen som skoter brottsbekampningen.  Exemplet Hammarkullen ar en god illustration pa just detta: har kopplas en stor del av problematiken till en stor och, enligt polisen, ordentligt brottsaktiv slakt. Med all respekt for kommunala forebyggande insatser, sa ar det i forsta hand polisen som kan mota den utmaning det innebar i ett kortare perspektiv.  AB Framtidens plan  Med allt detta sagt: att Goteborgs stad inte ska ha nagra utsatta omraden ar sjalvfallet en rimlig och bra ambition. Sa lat oss titta pa hur man jobbat for att na dit sedan beslutet fattades.  Under 2020 fattade den kommunala bostadskoncernen AB Framtiden beslut om att avsatta 11 miljarder kronor for att jobba mot malet. En strategi - som bygger pa bland annat okad narvaro i omradena, renoveringar och nybyggen - togs fram och sedan dess har bolaget lopande redovisat hur arbetet gar.  Gott sa. Men resten av stadens alla verksamheter? Tja, vi kan val hoppas pa att de stravar pa, var och en pa sitt hall.  Efter budgetbeslutet 2019 drojde det ett helt ar innan politikerna fattade ett beslut om att ta fram en handlingsplan. I en intervju med GP hosten 2021 sa kommunstyrelsens davarande ordforande Axel Josefson (M) att handlingsplanen var pa gang.  Det samlade greppet saknas  Nu var det forstas inte sa att arbetet stod helt stilla under tiden, men handlingsplanen ska anda ses som ett viktigt instrument for att samla och strukturera upp insatserna. En karta att halla sig i pa vagen mot malet, helt enkelt.  I slutet av 2021 fick politikerna i kommunstyrelsen ett forsta utkast till handlingsplan. Den skickades ut till forvaltningar och andra for att fa in synpunkter och kom tillbaka i februari 2022. Flera remissinstanser, som forskolan, pekade pa att det kravdes mer pengar for att genomfora planen. Socialforvaltningen Sydvast ifragasatte om inriktningen pa forebyggande arbete verkligen var i linje med ambitionen att na malet till 2025.  Och polisen - som ju faktiskt avgor vilka stadsdelar som klassas som utsatta - konstaterade stillsamt att de ar  tveksamma till att insatserna ar tillrackliga for att astadkomma varaktiga positiva forandringar .  Malet framflyttat  Inte heller politikerna var nojda och skickade tillbaka planen till tjanstemannen. Nytt forsok. Efter sommaren 2022 var en reviderad version uppe pa kommunstyrelsens bord.  Den nadde anda upp till kommunfullmaktige for faststallande, men dar tog det stopp strax efter jul. Den nya majoriteten S-V-MP vill ha en fordjupad ekonomisk analys av hur planen ska kunna genomforas och flytta fram malet for sarskilt utsatta omraden till 2030 och till 2035 for utsatta omraden.  Dar ar vi nu. Mer an tre ar har gatt sedan beslutet att de utsatta omradena ska bort fattades. Men nagon plan for hur malet ska nas existerar fortfarande inte."}, {"source": "goteborgs-posten", "title": "Sa hanterar goteborgarna de allt hogre matpriserna", "text": "Goteborgs-Posten ar som bast nar du ar inloggad.

Powell  stepped up and took a flamethrower to the regulations,  Warren said on ABC's  This Week.   It is moves like this that led Warren to oppose Powell's nomination to the Fed, she said.   Jerome Powell has said that all he wants to do is lighten regulations on the banks. I opposed him as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank precisely for that reason. I said he was a dangerous man to have in this position,  she said.  Warren, who has long opposed government intervention that helps big business at the expense of small business and the nation's workforce, also criticized Powell for sacrificing U.S. employment in order to combat inflation.   What Chair Powell is trying to do -- and he has said fairly explicitly is that they are trying to, in effect, slow down the economy so that (this is, by the Fed's own estimate) -- 2 million people will lose their jobs.

When asked whether President Joe Biden should replace Powell, Warren told NBC's Chuck Todd:  I don't think he should be Chairman of the Federal Reserve.

The ruling could jeopardize coverage nationwide for people relying on the health care law for preventive services, such as screenings for cancer, as well as HIV drugs.  In the decision, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor mentioned his previous ruling on the structure of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which was created under Obamacare and helps determine preventive services coverage, saying it violates the appointments clause of the Constitution and therefore its related preventive care mandates are unlawful.  O'Connor also said Obamacare's requirement to cover drugs preventing HIV, known as PrEP, violates the religious rights of plaintiffs under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.  A sign directs people to an insurance company where they can sign up for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in Miami in 2015. Joe Raedle / Getty Images file  The plaintiffs objected to buying health insurance that provided coverage for those drugs, the human papillomavirus vaccine, contraceptives and screenings for sexually transmitted diseases because  coverage for those services violates their religious beliefs by making them complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman,  O'Connor wrote.  In September, the judge said the preventive services requirements were unconstitutional, but he hadn't decided whether the determination should apply nationally, a decision he made in Thursday's ruling.  The Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Biden administration and more than 20 states had asked the judge not to rule broadly against the preventive care requirement, which they said millions now relied on to safeguard their health.  O'Connor, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, has issued a number of rulings targeting Obamacare in recent years. In 2018, he struck down the 2010 health care law, saying,  The individual mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress's tax power and is still impermissible under the interstate Commerce Clause -- meaning the individual mandate is unconstitutional.   The Supreme Court, however, ultimately ruled in favor of the law, rejecting GOP efforts to dismantle it."}, {"source": "lenta", "title": "SShA prigotovilis' priniat' bezhentsev iz Ukrainy", "text": "Press-sekretar' Belogo doma Psaki zaiavila o gotovnosti SShA razmestit' ukrainskikh bezhentsev  Predstavitel' Belogo doma Dzhen Psaki v khode reguliarnogo brifinga prokommentirovala, gotovy li SShA razmestit' u sebia bezhentsev s Ukrainy.

When the Fed raises its key rate, it typically leads to higher rates on mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and many business loans.  When measured against prices a year ago, inflation has been easing for eight months. In February, consumer prices climbed 6% from 12 months earlier, down from January's 6.4% year-over-year increase and well below a recent peak of 9.1% in June. Yet it remains far above the Fed's 2% annual inflation target. Core prices in February rose 5.5% from 12 months ago, down slightly from 5.6% in January.  Inflation pressures remain entrenched in much of the economy. Rents, grocery prices and the cost of hotels, restaurants and airplane flights have all been surging as more Americans seek housing and spend money on traveling, dining out and attending entertainment events.  Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, said Goldman now thinks the Fed's policymakers will pause their rate increases next week. Goldman had previously predicted a quarter-point hike. In a note to clients, Hatzius noted that the Fed, for now, appears even more focused on calming the banking sector and the financial markets than on fighting inflation.   We would be surprised if, just one week after going to great lengths to support financial stability, policymakers risked undermining their efforts by raising interest rates again,  Hatzius wrote in a separate note Monday.  If the Fed does pause its rate hikes this month, Hatzius predicted, it will likely resume them when it next meets in May. Ultimately, he still expects the Fed to raise its key rate, which affects many consumer and business loans, to about 5.4% this year, up from the current 4.6%.  The Fed may get some unintentional help in its inflation fight from the aftereffects of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and New York-based Signature Bank. In response, many small and medium-size banks may pull back on lending to shore up their finances. A lower pace of lending could help cool the economy and slow inflation.  The possibility of a Fed pause underscores the sharp shift in the nation's financial system and economy in barely one week. Last Tuesday, Powell had told the Senate Banking Committee that if hiring and inflation continued to run hot, the Fed would likely raise rates at this month's meeting by a sizeable half-point.  That would have marked a re-acceleration in the Fed's efforts to tighten credit. The central bank had raised its benchmark rate by a quarter-point in February, a half-point in December and by three-quarters of point four times before that.  The next day, testifying to a House committee, Powell cautioned that no final decision had been made about what the Fed would do at the March meeting. Still, on Friday, the government reported that employers added a robust 311,000 jobs last month. It was a potential sign of continued high inflation, and it led to predictions of a half-point hike at the Fed's meeting next week.  Later that day, though, Silicon Valley Bank failed, thrusting an entirely new set of concerns onto the Fed."}, {"source": "nbc-news", "title": "2 Army Blackhawk helicopters crash during training in Kentucky", "text": "Nine soldiers were killed when two Army Black Hawk helicopters crashed during a training exercise in Kentucky on Wednesday night, officials said Thursday morning.  The crash occurred at around 10 p.m. local time (11 p.m. ET) in Trigg County, west of Fort Campbell, the Army base said in a statement early Thursday. The two HH-60 Black Hawk medical evacuation aircraft were engaged in a training exercise, officials said.  All nine soldiers were based at Fort Campbell in the 101st Airborne Division. Their identities were not immediately made public, pending next-of-kin notification.  Brig. Gen. John Lubas, with the 101st Airborne Division, said there were five people in one helicopter and four in the other, which he described as  fairly typical.   The helicopters were being flown using night vision goggles, Lubas said.  The Army has a deployed an aircraft safety team from Alabama who will arrive later Thursday and initiate an investigation into the cause of the crash, Lubas said. He said he is hopeful investigators will be able to pull data from on-board computers, noting there's something similar to a black box on board that can shed more light on the crash.   This is a truly tragic loss for our families, our division and Fort Campbell and our number one priority is caring for the families and the soldiers within our combat aviation brigade,  Lubas said.  Tim Gore, a pastor in North Carolina, on Thursday identified his son as one of the nine soldiers killed.  In a statement provided to NBC News he called his son, Staff Sgt. Caleb Gore, 25, a real-life Captain America who loved serving his country in the Army.   His passion was search and rescue and if you happened to be wounded on the battlefield, Caleb coming out of that helicopter would be the most beautiful thing you would ever see,  the statement said.

Evan Gershkovich was detained in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg on suspicion of  espionage in the interests of the American government,  the Federal Security Service (FSB) said in a statement, which was reported by state media.  The FSB accused Gershkovich of collecting  information constituting a state secret about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military-industrial complex.   The Journal denied the charges.  The FSB provided no evidence or further details on when Gershkovich was detained. He was later taken to the Lefortovo court in Moscow and formally arrested. The court quickly ordered Gershkovich's initial detention until May 29, according to the official Telegram channel of the capital's courts.  Officers escort Evan Gershkovich from the Moscow court to an awaiting vehicle. Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP  He denied his guilt, according to the TASS state news agency. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.  Gershkovich is the first journalist from an American outlet to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since the Cold War. The charges come at a time of bitter tensions between Washington and Moscow over the war in Ukraine, and as the Kremlin cracks down on free speech at home.   We are not talking about suspicions, but about the fact that he was detained red-handed,  Kremlin spokesman Dimtry Peskov said at a news briefing, adding that the arrest was up to the FSB.  The Journal said in a statement that it  vehemently denies the allegations from the FSB and seeks the immediate release of our trusted and dedicated reporter.  It added:  We stand in solidarity with Evan and his family.   U.S. officials have been in touch with the Journal, a senior Biden administration official said.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that he was  deeply concerned over Russia's widely-reported detention of a U.S. citizen journalist.    In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices,  he said.  Gershkovich covers Russia, Ukraine and the former Soviet Union for the Journal.  He was previously a reporter for Agence France-Presse and the Moscow Times and a news assistant at The New York Times, according to his author page on the Journal's website.  Gershkovich, 31, speaks Russian. His parents live in the United States and are originally from the former Soviet Union.  His most recent article was published Tuesday and co-bylined, with the headline:  Russia's Economy Is Starting to Come Undone.   The FSB noted that he had accreditation from the Russian Foreign Ministry to work as a journalist, but ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Gershkovich was using his journalistic credentials as a cover for  activities that have nothing to do with journalism.   His arrest comes amid high tensions between Moscow and Washington over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  It also comes following the high-profile prisoner swap involving WNBA star Brittney Griner.  Griner was released from a Russian penal colony in December in exchange for arms dealer Viktor Bout after she pleaded guilty to having vape canisters with cannabis oil in her luggage, but said she had no criminal intent.  There had been hopes that Paul Whelan -- a U.S. corporate security executive jailed in Russia on espionage charges -- might be included in the exchange, but he remains imprisoned.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov ruled out any quick swap involving Gershkovich.   I wouldn't even consider this issue now because people who were previously swapped had already served their sentences,  Ryabkov said, according to Russian news agencies.  In recent years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has overseen the largest crackdown on the free press and political dissent since the Soviet era.  That intensified after his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with Russia adopting strict laws that prohibit criticism of the military, leading many journalists to flee the country.   Let's wait to see what the FSB specifically presents, but it appears that they have taken a hostage,  said Tatiana Stanovaya, a nonresident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the founder and head of the political analysis firm R.Politik.

We clicked. We hit it off. And our ratings were skyrocketing,  Grossberg said.  But over the next four years, as she tried and failed to get a promotion and then switched to working for Tucker Carlson, Grossberg says she ran up against a hyper misogynistic culture in which walls were plastered with photos of Nancy Pelosi in a plunging bathing suit and male staffers openly debated which female politicians they'd rather have sex with.  It culminated in Grossberg complaining to a supervisor and then moving to file lawsuits alleging that she was harassed, retaliated against and ultimately set up to be the scapegoat in Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation suit against Fox News.   They're a big corporate machine that destroys people,  Grossberg told NBC News in her most extensive interview to date.   I sat in those meetings. I heard them laugh about tearing apart politicians. Now I know that in those meetings they're talking about me.   For more on this story, tune in to NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt tonight at 6:30pm ET/5:30pm CT or check your local listings.  After this story was published, a Fox News spokesperson sent a statement that described Grossberg's legal claims as  unmeritorious  and  riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees.   The Dominion lawsuit has put the network in a perilous position.  Abby Grossberg. NBC News  Fox News is accused of repeatedly airing false allegations from Rudy Giuliani and others that the voting machine company  rigged  the 2020 election in favor of Joe Biden. The network has said the claims from lawyers for former President Donald Trump were newsworthy and its coverage was protected by the First Amendment.  Jury selection for the trial is scheduled to begin on April 13. Dominion indicated this week that it intends to call Grossberg as a witness.  On Thursday, Grossberg's lawyer Parisis Filippatos filed a motion to intervene in Dominion's lawsuit against Fox in Delaware to assert her rights to the scope or location of her potential testimony, or alternatively unseal any transcripts concerning her or her testimony. Her lawyers state in the filing that Fox cannot rely on her  coerced, inaccurate, deposition testimony  while simultaneously asking the court to keep references to her testimony sealed.  But Dominion and Fox are still awaiting a summary judgment ruling from the judge that could favor one side, or go forward with the trial.  In the interview, Grossberg said network executives were well aware that she was booking guests like Giuliani and lawyer Sidney Powell for the  Sunday Morning Futures With Maria Bartiromo  show, and that they were likely to spread unfounded conspiracy theories about Dominion's voting machines.  Grossberg said there was only one thing network executives told her was off limits: a guest criticizing Fox News for being the first network to call Arizona, a crucial swing state, for Biden.   Because, you know, that kind of impacted the ratings at Fox,  Grossberg said.  Prior to the election, it was not unusual for executives to bar the show from booking certain guests, Grossberg said. But in the days afterward, there was a marked shift, according to Grossberg.   All of a sudden, it was caution to the wind,  Grossberg said.  There was no one to be found. And these were the individuals that were ultimately responsible for the programming at the network.   At one point, Grossberg said she received a text message from her boss that she paraphrased as saying:  You can let Maria know there will be no fact checking today. She can do what she wants. ... Go wild.   The Fox News spokesperson said Grossberg's boss  had been referring instead to a practice in which Fox shows sometimes criticized material that had aired elsewhere on the network.   Behind the scenes, Fox executives were fretting over its viewers fleeing the network in favor of startup outlets that were even further to the right and were devoting even more air time to election falsehoods, according to depositions previously released by Dominion.  Grossberg said Bartiromo's show was so short-staffed that she was forced to do multiple jobs at once. She said she asked for a promotion several times -- as well as for additional staffers -- but the requests fell on deaf ears.  All the while, Fox higher-ups referred to Bartiromo as  crazy,   menopausal  and often  hysterical,  Grossberg said in her suit.  The Fox News spokesperson said the network  cannot verify  those statements and that the people she attributed the remarks to were on the producer level and not in any level of leadership.  Grossberg was still working for Bartiromo when Dominion filed its lawsuit against Fox in 2021. She accepted a job with Carlson's team in July 2022.  Prior to sitting for a deposition, Grossberg met with Fox lawyers that August. She said they repeatedly coached her to refrain from going into detail about higher-ups at the network.   I was flat out told, 'You do not want to be the star witness in this case,' when I was very truthful and forthcoming,  Grossberg said.   I realized that the answers that they wanted me to say were putting me in a very vulnerable position to be the company scapegoat.   She said she was also told at the start that she didn't need her own lawyer. But after she started questioning and pushing back on some of the lawyers' advice, the deposition was canceled and her subsequent meetings with Fox lawyers grew more tense.  At one point, she said, they suggested she might be hiding something.   I was called into a boardroom with the attorneys and made to believe that they had something criminal on me that there was something on my phones or my emails or somewhere that they were looking for it,  Grossberg said.  She said the lawyers told her she would have to get her own lawyer if they found something incriminating on her phone.   I remember I was shaking,  Grossberg said.  This is a multibillion dollar case. ... I said, 'I can't afford my own attorney.' And they go, 'Well, we'll see what we find.'   The Fox News spokesperson said  the assertion that Ms. Grossberg was coached or intimidated into being dishonest during her Dominion deposition is patently false.   Grossberg was praised after she sat for her deposition in September and toed the company line. She says her colleagues declared it  Abby Day  in celebration.  But she said Fox didn't give her a copy of the deposition until five months later despite numerous requests. That prevented her from reviewing it and making changes, according to her lawyer who cited rules in Delaware that the deposition should have been turned over in 30 days.   The type of preparation that they engaged in and the way that they manipulated her goes way beyond the pale, way beyond the pale, of anything I've ever experienced,  Grossberg's lawyer, Gerry Filippatos, said.  Abby Grossberg, center, with lawyers Kimberly Catala and Gerry Filippatos. NBC News  One such answer she said she would have changed created an uproar when it was released in a Dominion filing. When asked if she felt it was important to correct a false claim made on the air, Grossberg said no, according to the transcript.   It felt terrible because I knew that I was bullied, intimidated and coerced into saying that just to keep my job and stay at the company,  Grossberg said.  I made the decision to keep my job so that I can keep paying my bills.   Grossberg said the revelations from Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch's deposition confirmed her suspicions that she and Bartiromo were being  thrown under the bus.  Murdoch identified Bartiromo as one of the hosts who had done more than just given a platform to baseless claims of voter fraud.   They endorsed,  Murdoch said, according to a transcript.  Said Grossberg:  It's really, really terrifying to think that you could be the fall guy in perhaps the biggest media case the country's ever had.   Grossberg sued Fox News in Delaware and New York on March 20.  The lawsuits alleged that the network had a  toxic workplace  culture of discrimination and that company lawyers  coerced, intimidated, and misinformed  her as they prepared her to testify in Dominion's defamation suit.  Fox fired her last week, alleging she had disclosed privileged information in her legal claims despite being warned that she was  not authorized to disclose it publicly.  Grossberg alleges in amended complaints that her firing was retaliation for taking legal action.  The stress and anxiety had prompted Grossberg to take a medical leave from Fox earlier this year.  It got so bad, she said, that she called a crisis hotline one night. During a walk home from the office, she said she had found herself thinking that she could step in front of a car.   And I wouldn't have to go to work tomorrow,  Grossberg said.  That crossed my mind. It definitely did. I really had no hope in those moments.   Grossberg said she's in a better place now. She hopes her story will inspire others in similar situations to speak up.   It takes a lot of courage, but it also feels really good and really validating to be able to say this isn't OK,  she said."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "Did Disney pull a fast one ahead of DeSantis' takeover scheme?", "text": "Gov.

As NBC News' report added, it grants Disney  prior review and comment  over any changes made to properties in the local district, and forbids the political board from using Disney's brand name or any of its trademarks. All of this, the document added, would be enforceable  in perpetuity.   Evidently, the governor's political appointees weren't aware of any of this, and they're not especially pleased. One told the Sentinel that Disney's move represents a  subversion  of DeSantis' scheme, and leaves the governor's board with far less authority than it expected to have.  That impression is probably accurate. In fact, it was almost certainly the point of the power-shifting directive in the first place. A Washington Post report described the move as a  bureaucratic coup.   As DeSantis and his allied state legislators advanced their plan, it struck me as odd that Disney didn't put up more of a public fight. It suddenly makes more sense: Maybe the corporate giant didn't make a fuss because it was taking steps to circumvent the governor's new board and its appointees.  As for what's next, DeSantis' board members are threatening litigation, and the matter seems likely to become a lengthy legal mess. Watch this space.

Now, some of those candidates are pushing a wave of legislation boosting DeVos' longtime goal: subsidizing private schools with public dollars.  Using at least $2.5 million from DeVos and her husband, the American Federation for Children has played a pivotal role in getting what supporters call  school choice  policies passed into law in at least three states and introduced in several more, according to current and former GOP legislators, lobbyists for teachers unions and academics.  The nonprofit group has found success amid a 20-year low in approval for the K-12 education system and after two years of protests over lessons involving race and LGBTQ identity. It is now on the verge of ushering in a transformation in how large swaths of the country fund schools.   They've been quite strategic,  Patrick Wolf, an education policy professor at the University of Arkansas, said of the group.  They've particularly targeted rural Republicans who are opposed to school choice. They just had to take out a few marginal incumbents, and thereby put the fear of God into the rest of them.   It's difficult to determine whether the laws would have been enacted without the American Federation for Children's involvement; other groups supporting the same  school choice  policies also targeted lawmakers with campaign ads last year. Each state's political landscape is unique and subject to myriad factors. But the federation's spending preceded a marked increase in both the scale of private school subsidies on the table at the state level and the rate at which the laws have been enacted.  In Florida, where the American Federation for Children's state political action committee spent $1.7 million during last year's elections, Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law Monday that will allow more families to receive public funds to pay for private education, regardless of their financial need.  In Iowa and Arkansas, where the organization's PAC put money into ousting incumbent Republicans who had resisted past proposals to subsidize private education, GOP governors signed sweeping legislation this winter to offer money for school tuition for every child in their states.  And in Texas, where the American Federation for Children's PAC spent $1 million during last year's election cycle, and in Georgia, where it spent $380,000, bills recently advanced in the GOP-controlled legislatures to create programs to fund private schooling.   We're doing a lot of winning -- I'm almost getting tired of winning so much because we're winning all across the country,  Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the federation, said in a Twitter Space on Sunday.  DeVos and other conservatives have long advocated for financially supporting families who want to move their children from public schools to private ones, calling these policies  school choice,  and arguing that they would help poor children get a better education. Opponents, including teachers unions, educators and Democrats, have pushed back, arguing that such policies would siphon students and money away from public schools.  DeVos, a billionaire philanthropist, was unsuccessful in pushing for  school choice  bills in Congress during her time in the Trump administration and was stymied in attempts to reroute federal dollars toward private education, but the political winds among the GOP base have changed since then.  Republican lawmakers in over a dozen states have recently cited complaints about liberal ideology in public schools as a reason to support helping parents pay for private education. That shift in strategy has been hailed by organizations like the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that helped spur parent protests over lessons about racism. And it has helped cement funding for private schooling as a benchmark of Republican governance.  DeVos said in a June 2022 C-SPAN interview that parent protests had driven increased interest in  education freedom  policies, and that this was having an electoral impact.   Importantly, we've seen this issue really inform many of the primary races this year in states where there haven't been programs and where there's been legislation introduced in the past but there simply hasn't been enough support,  she said.  But this issue has really popped to the top of the list for many states. And so I think in this next year or two, we're going to see some major gains.   Tommy Schultz, CEO of the American Federation for Children, said the group targeted 69 incumbents in state legislatures last year and ousted 40 of them.  The group is  willing to beat opponents of either party who oppose the desires of parents who want these educational options,  Schultz said in a statement.   Especially after 2020 and the chaos created for parents by the teachers' unions and the education establishment,  he added,  parents are now winning one of the most important domestic policy issues of our time: school choice.   Removing incumbents is a move that sends a strong signal, said Maurice Cunningham, a University of Massachusetts-Boston professor who studies the impact of dark money groups:  Get in our way, and you'll be gone.    Politicians are rational,  Cunningham said.  It intimidates people. Who wants to be next after that?   DeVos left her role as chairman of the American Federation for Children when she joined the Trump administration, but she remains one of its largest financial backers. She and her husband, Dick, gave at least $2.25 million to the nonprofit group's national PAC and $250,000 to its Texas PAC last year. The organization's national political arm also drew $1 million from Cleveland Browns co-owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam for its national election efforts. Jim Walton, a billionaire banker and son of the Walmart founder, put in $100,000 toward the group's work in Arizona last year.  The American Federation for Children  helps make sure what's best for students comes first by ensuring parents, not just the unions, have a seat at the table when it comes to education policy,  Nate Bailey, DeVos' chief of staff, said in an email.  The Haslams said in a statement that they support the American Federation for Children's efforts  to help students from all different areas and backgrounds have a chance for a quality education and a brighter future.   Walton did not respond to requests for comment.  Perhaps nowhere has the federation's impact been more evident than in Iowa.  Proposals to direct taxpayer money to cover the cost of attending a private K-12 school floundered in the Iowa Legislature for several years. Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, pushed for this funding as a way to help students from low-income families get a better education. But Democrats uniformly opposed it, and many rural Republicans did, too, worried that the shift in funding would hobble public schools and cost the state too much money.  The proposals Reynolds advocated for in previous years were limited in scope. They would have provided state dollars to families to pay for private school if their child had special needs, or went to poor performing public schools, and included income caps. A majority of Iowans opposed them, according to polls.  Last year, Reynolds endorsed supporters of her education proposals in nine state legislative primaries, including primary challengers running against incumbent GOP lawmakers. The American Federation for Children Action Fund spent $254,000 during the primaries, targeting some of the same legislators, including Dustin Hite, a Republican who chaired the Iowa House Education Committee.  Hite faced a challenge from Helena Hayes, a mother who home-schooled her children and had no political experience before the primary. Hayes said she didn't realize groups like the American Federation for Children had gotten behind her until she received supportive flyers in the mail with her picture on them. The nonprofit group also sent out mailers that linked Hite to  liberal teachers unions  and blamed him for blocking school choice proposals.  Hayes said that she was grateful to the American Federation for Children, and that the money the group  poured into my campaign, enabling and helping me win that primary,  was what boosted her chances.  Hite said he had opposed previous proposals to fund private education because the vast majority of his constituents in a district of small towns outside of Des Moines told him they did not support them. He didn't expect a sitting governor of the same political party, or national conservative groups, to campaign against him in the primary.   That probably made the difference,  Hite said.  Because what I was starting to get as the campaign wore on was reactions from people over mailers they would see or advertisements they would hear.   Hite spent $43,000 before the June primary, while Hayes spent just $4,000. The American Federation for Children Action Fund put $64,000 into the race -- significantly more than either candidate.   To see one entity dump that much money into the primary is unheard of,  said Melissa Peterson, lobbyist for the Iowa State Education Association, a teachers union that donated $2,500 to Hite last year.  The American Federation for Children financed mailers that tied Republican legislators to liberal groups.  Hayes took Hite's seat in the House, and six other candidates backed by the American Federation for Children also won, helping to give the GOP an expanded majority in the Iowa Legislature.  In January, Iowa Republicans passed a seismic bill that will, within three years, provide up to $7,598 for every family to pay for private school expenses, with no income cap. After the bill cleared both chambers, lawmakers hugged the federation's DeAngelis, and Reynolds clasped his hands in jubilation, according to photos and video captured by reporters.  The mailers also promoted GOP candidates who supported offering funding for private schools.   That school choice bill was won back in the primaries,  said Hayes, who voted in favor of it.  Reynolds, who did not respond to a request for comment, later promoted the new law as a way to financially pressure public schools to drop contentious lessons on race and policies to accommodate transgender children, because parents who don't support those lessons and policies can now easily move their children to private school.  However, the new law appears unpopular. Sixty-two percent of Iowans said in a Des Moines Register poll this month that they disapprove of it, including 51% of Republicans.  Many of the bills moving forward this year create education savings accounts, in which parents whose children do not attend public school receive money for approved expenses related to private schooling, including books, supplies and tutoring. These accounts -- which a former Heritage Foundation fellow proposed, modeling the idea off of health savings accounts -- differ slightly from vouchers, in which states pay private schools directly for children's tuition. Some states have already used education savings accounts, but in the past have limited them to children with disabilities or those from poor families.  Arizona was the first state to implement universal education savings accounts last year, opening up a decade-old program to all families. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who was elected governor in November, has said she wants to roll back this expansion because too much money otherwise reserved for public schools has gone toward wealthy families. But that will be a hard sell in the Arizona Legislature, where the American Federation for Children's state PAC spent $512,000 to help Republicans hold slim majorities.  The organization also worked against activists who were collecting signatures in an attempt to force a voter referendum on the new universal education savings account program.  When Save Our Schools Arizona, a public school activist group, held signature drives, counter-protesters showed up with signs reading  Do Not Sign Anything from SOS Arizona.  The bottom of the signs included a disclosure:  Paid for by the American Federation for Children.   The push for a referendum failed."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "After school shooting, GOP's Donalds downplays role of 'emotions'", "text": "The day after the deadly mass shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville, CNN caught up with Republican Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida, who seemed eager to shut down any further conversation about trying to prevent gun violence.   Let's not get into politics, alright? Let's not get into emotion, because emotion feels good, but emotion doesn't solve problems.   If the idea is that unproductive emotions such as panic and hysteria don't lead to worthwhile policy outcomes, I'd be inclined to agree. But if the public and its elected representatives are shocked by avoidable massacres, and want to take steps to prevent future bloodshed, that's not just a mindless, emotional reaction, it's a constructive desire to protect people from harm.   Emotion doesn't solve problems ? Perhaps not, but indifference doesn't solve problems, either.   Emotion feels good ? Not always, it doesn't. When people grieve in the wake of mass murders, including the deaths of children, it doesn't feel  good  at all. What feels far better is when people elected to serve the public's interests take steps to prevent avoidable catastrophes.  When the GOP congressman was asked whether Americans need assault rifles, he responded,  Need is in the eye of the beholder. I don't question why you need a blue suit, but you got one.   And if formal wear and AR-15s had anything in common, that comparison might make sense. What's more, if blue suits were responsible for the slaughter of many innocent Americans, I'd like to think Congress would take an interest in the matter.  Finally, CNN's Manu Raju asked Donalds about limiting consumer access to weapons such as the AR-15.  If you're gonna talk about the AR-15, you're talking politics now,  the Republican responded.  First, asking about a specific firearm, used in multiple massacres, is a substantive, policy-focused question. It's not as if the reporter asked him to weigh in on electoral trivia or the latest poll. To ask about potentially life-saving reforms related to a public health hazard is to talk governance.  Second, I'm not altogether sure what Donalds means when he uses the word  politics  to dismiss the issue. He is, after all, a politician. He ran a political campaign. He was elected to a political office. He serves alongside 434 other politicians who collectively participate in political processes.  If the Florida Republican doesn't want to use the political process to solve problems, perhaps he's in the wrong line of work?"}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "Judge in defamation case reveals details Fox News tried to hide", "text": "Dominion Voting Systems and the company's lawyers have high thresholds to meet in their defamation case against Fox News, but in terms of the political impact of their lawsuit, the revelations have already been devastating -- and they somehow keep getting worse.  To briefly recap, a recent court filing presented evidence that suggested Fox News promoted bogus election claims they knew to be false, on purpose, in order to placate its audience and make money. We also learned, among other things, that News Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch acknowledged under oath that some prominent Fox News hosts  endorsed  baseless claims the network knew to be wrong.  As part of a pretrial hearing, Dominion prepared a series of slides that referenced internal communications and testimony. Fox News redacted some pertinent details, but as NBC News reported, the judge in the case yesterday ordered that they be made public. That didn't do the network any favors.  Ten days after the 2020 election, Fox News' so-called Brain Room looked into conspiracy theories that Dominion Voting Systems had rigged the presidential election against Donald Trump. The fact-checking and research division of the network came back with a clear decision: Those claims were false. But the misinformation went on the air anyway.  During one deposition, a Dominion lawyer asked David Clark, Fox News' senior vice president for weekend news and programming,  If the Brain Room had concluded that the charges were, in fact, false, they never should have been aired, correct?  The network executive replied,  Yes.   But the claims were aired anyway.  What's more, this wasn't the only revelation of note from NBC News' reporting.  On Dec. 2, 2020, Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott sent an email to Meade Cooper, the executive vice president of prime-time programming, complaining about a segment in which an on-air anchor told viewers the truth about some of Trump's bogus voter fraud claims.  This has to stop now,  Scott wrote.  The audience is furious and we are just feeding them material. Bad for business.   On Jan. 20, 2021, News Corp. Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch emailed Scott, marveling at Trump's election-related lies.  Trump insisting on the election being stolen and convincing 25% of Americans was a huge disservice to the country. Pretty much a crime. Inevitable it blew up Jan 6th,  he wrote.  Before putting Sidney Powell on the air for a bonkers interview, Maria Bartiromo sent unhinged messages to a producer, saying, among other things,  We have to go to a full on war.  The far-right host added,  We have to keep this president. Noone [sic] thinks anyway that people voted for Biden,  before pointing to non-existent evidence of Dominion wrongdoing. Bartiromo's weird conspiracy theory also referenced then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and George Soros for reasons that aren't entirely clear.  The case has already taken a noticeable toll on Fox' public standing, and Democratic officials increasingly see the disclosures as a unique scandal, causing the party to rethink its entire approach to the network.  Fox News, meanwhile, has denied all wrongdoing and is vigorously contesting the lawsuit. In a statement to NBC News, a network spokesperson said,  These documents once again demonstrate Dominion's continued reliance on cherry-picked quotes without context to generate headlines in order to distract from the facts of this case. The foundational right to a free press is at stake and we will continue to fiercely advocate for the First Amendment in protecting the role of news organizations to cover the news.

This surveillance video shows the shooter arriving at The Covenant School, carrying what police called an assault-type rifle and wearing a tactical vest with another rifle visible.  There is also bodycam footage, and we must warn you: It is graphic.  But we're showing it to you for three reasons:  One, so that more of us can understand the abject terror unleashed in a school shooting.  Two, to prove that there is no way a teacher alone can take down a shooter armed with a weapon of war, the way that trained police can do.  And third, to show you how police are supposed to respond.  The footage further proves how the delayed, incompetent and, one might say, cowardly response in Uvalde, Texas -- when officers waited more than an hour outside the classrooms where the gunman killed 21 people -- was a complete disgrace.  We're talking about an elementary school, where cubbies held tiny jackets and backpacks and lunchboxes.  No other country does this to their children, forcing little kids to live -- and die -- like this. It's literally just us!

When asked what he would do to protect young children, one Tennessee lawmaker simply noted that he home-schools his daughter, so his family's good!  As for the rest of America?

This is an excerpt from Tuesday's episode of the  The ReidOut.  It has been slightly edited for length and clarity."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "Republican's Nashville shooting claims ignore red flag gun laws", "text": "On Monday, six people, three of them children who didn't live to see age 10, were murdered in Nashville at the hands of a shooter armed with assault-style weapons. This problem of mass shootings, including those that target children at schools, has caused some lawmakers to essentially throw up their hands in defeat. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who is either unable or unwilling to envision a legislative solution, asserted in an interview that Congress is  not gonna fix  the problem of school shootings and argued that the U.S. needs not gun control legislation but a  real revival.  But as prosecutors, we count strong gun laws among the practical, commonsense legislative solutions that have saved lives. And key among these solutions are red flag laws.  The problem of mass shootings, including those that target children at schools, has caused some lawmakers to essentially throw up their hands in defeat.  The Nashville shooter was able to legally obtain seven weapons, three of which were used in the attack, which police say was  calculated and planned.  Significantly, as in so many other mass shootings, early reporting indicates that the attacker exhibited troubling warning signs to family members. Nashville Police Chief John Drake has said the shooter's parents felt the 28-year-old  should not own weapons.   This is an all-too-common fact pattern for such crimes. According to a 2021 Everytown for Gun Safety report, perpetrators in 56% of mass shootings exhibited dangerous warning signs before they carried out their attacks. In a 2021 Department of Homeland Security analysis, two-thirds of attackers in mass shootings exhibited behaviors or communications  that were so concerning, they should have been met with an immediate response.   It's even more traumatizing to victims and even those who read or watch reports of a deadly mass shooting every time we learn that it might have been prevented. Critically, there's something we as a country can do to help stem the tide.  Well-known and widely discussed proposals include banning assault weapons, closing loopholes on background checks and instituting waiting periods. But we first should focus on passing strong extreme risk laws (also called red flag laws) at the national and state levels, and where such laws already exist, we should focus on raising awareness of them and significantly increasing the training for those who will be asked to invoke them.  Currently, 19 states and Washington, D.C., have adopted red flag laws, which allow judges to temporarily remove people's access to guns and temporarily prevent the purchase of new guns when there is evidence that the people pose serious risks to themselves or others. But that leaves 31 states, including Tennessee, with no such tool.  This means that even if the Nashville shooter's parents had wanted to raise the  red flag  about the dangerous warning signs they saw in their adult child, their options were limited. And even in states that have strong red flag laws, we believe there has been significant underuse because of a lack of awareness and training.  President Joe Biden's recent announcement that the Justice Department will give more than $231 million to states for crisis intervention projects, such as red flag programs, is a strong start, but it's not a substitute for a federal red flag law. And red flag laws at the state and local levels must be strengthened, expanded and accompanied by national and state programs to ensure that existing laws are fully used.  In New York, something remarkable has happened. Statewide, the number of Extreme Risk Protection Orders, or ERPOs, skyrocketed from 500 filed in 2021 to 3,500 last year. While it's hard to prove that any particular ERPO prevented a mass shooting, these numbers demonstrate that more people are empowered to report warning signs before it's too late. We are confident, based on many of statements of fact supporting these ERPO petitions, that tragedies have been averted.  Despite the relentless headlines, weekly mass shootings aren't inevitable.  What caused this dramatic rise in the use of New York's red flag laws? Since it went into effect in 2019, prosecutors' offices, such as ours in Westchester County, and police departments statewide have made tremendous efforts to increase public awareness and training to ensure police officers, prosecutors, school officials, doctors, therapists and parents know how to raise red flags when they see someone in crisis. Amendments passed last year strengthened New York's law, making it mandatory for law enforcement to petition for ERPOs under certain conditions, and those amendments expanded the categories of people who could file for petitions to include health care professionals.  Despite the relentless headlines, weekly mass shootings aren't inevitable, and, unlike Rep. Burchett, we can't resign ourselves to accepting this as our way of life. Discussions around gun regulation and gun safety measures are often irrationally overpoliticized, but all reasonable people should be able to agree that people having mental health crises and displaying dangerous warning signs shouldn't have easy access to high-capacity killing machines. Will this prevent all mass shootings? Of course not. But this approach will help. Red flag laws have to be widely implemented if we are to ever stem the tide of horrific and deadly shootings that keep our country traumatized."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "After shooting, Josh Hawley has a new perspective on hate crimes", "text": "On Monday, a shooter opened fire at the Covenant School in Nashville, killing six people, including three children. On Tuesday, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a congressional resolution condemning the slayings  as a hate crime.   To be sure, there may yet be evidence to support such a claim, but the investigation has just begun -- it's only been two days since the shooting -- and as Attorney General Merrick Garland reminded senators yesterday, the shooter's motive  hasn't been identified.   It appears Hawley isn't inclined to wait for the factual details to come into sharper focus. NBC News reported:  Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., on Tuesday called on federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the shooting at The Covenant School as a religious hate crime. ...  It is commonplace to call such horrors 'senseless violence,'  Hawley wrote in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.  But properly speaking, that is false. Police report that the attack here was 'targeted' -- targeted, that is, against Christians.   Again, it's entirely possible that the killings were the result of religious animus, but given the circumstances, it hardly seems outlandish to wait for investigators to collect evidence and share their findings. At least, that is, unless political grandstanding is deemed the higher priority.  It's also an open question as to why a senator from Missouri, who lives in Virginia, is trying to make snap judgments about a case in Tennessee.  But there's also a disconnect between the message and the messenger. Remember this NPR report from two years ago?  Capping nearly two weeks of talks between Democrats and Republicans, the Senate approved legislation on Thursday to ramp up law enforcement efforts to better protect the Asian American and Pacific Islander community from hate crimes. The move marks a rare moment of bipartisan unity needed to approve the Senate legislation despite a new political era marked by increasingly bitter party divisions. The bill, which needed 60 votes for passage in the evenly divided Senate, was approved by a 94-1 vote. Only GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri voted no.  Yes, in April 2021, the Senate easily approved new hate crimes legislation. Hawley knew the measure -- designed to empower law enforcement to help prevent and investigate hate crimes -- would pass with overwhelming bipartisan support, but the far-right Missourian voted against it anyway.  Now, evidently, the senator has a different perspective on the issue.  But The New Republic's Prem Thakker raised a related point yesterday that's worth keeping in mind, noting that Hawley did not scramble to label the May 2022 mass shooting in Buffalo a hate crime, despite the fact that the shooter left behind a racist manifesto, leaving no doubt about the racism at the heart of the gun violence.  After the Buffalo shooting, members of Congress began pushing for a Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, which sought to establish offices to focus on neo-Nazi and white supremacist terror threats. Hawley stood in full opposition to the bill, calling it the  Patriot Act for American citizens.  (The Patriot Act, a vestige of 9/11, already was policing American citizens, but perhaps Hawley didn't reflexively think of them as such since they were largely Brown men). And while it's fair to be hesitant of increasing American policing power, Hawley did not offer any meaningful alternatives to confront white supremacy (nor has he been a critic of law enforcement overreach when it comes to marginalized people anyhow).  I'm eager to hear the senator explain the evolution of his perspective on hate crimes, because at this point, his principles appear quite malleable."}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "3-ton parts of Stonehenge may have been carried from earlier monuments", "text": "It's not difficult to see why Stonehenge is one of the most iconic archaeological sites in the world.

But one question remains:  Why?  Why this school, why these victims, why was the shooter motivated to take these lives?  The search for a motive is a logical one. There's a deep desire to understand what pushed a person to carry out such a heinous crime, especially when three children are dead. Nashville police have said that the shooter left behind writings that would potentially showcase their reasoning. But already many on the right have seized on reporting that the shooter was transgender to put a new spin on their anti-trans hate.  We know that America is simply awash in firearms.  My inbox was relatedly filled this morning after my article on Monday with people who were outraged that I didn't mention the shooter being a transgender former student of the school. This is less of a  gotcha  than they seem to assume. As many pro-gun voices have said before, it's impossible to legislate against whatever  evil  lies in a mass shooter's head. This argument is often deployed as a defense against stronger gun laws. What it does not then grapple with is that it is entirely possible to legislate on the availability of guns in our society.  That fact remains true no matter the motive of the shooter. It's true when talking about the Santa Barbara, California, gunman who left behind a  manifesto  detailing his hatred of women in 2014. It's true when talking about the Charleston, South Carolina, shooter who walked into Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015 and killed nine people, whose white supremacy fueled his rampage. And it's true when talking about the 2017 Las Vegas massacre that remains the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history, even though to this day we have no solid answer about what prompted the slaughter.  What we can say with certainty though is that the shooter had  two AR-style rifles  with them on Monday afternoon. Nashville police said on Tuesday that the shooter had legally  bought seven firearms from five different local gun stores here  ahead of the shooting. As I noted on Monday, there is no waiting period or license required in the state of Tennessee before purchasing guns.  We also know that the AR-15 and similar weapons do unspeakable damage to the human body.  The AR-15 fires bullets at such a high velocity -- often in a barrage of 30 or even 100 in rapid succession -- that it can eviscerate multiple people in seconds,  according to The Washington Post.  A single bullet lands with a shock wave intense enough to blow apart a skull and demolish vital organs. The impact is even more acute on the compact body of a small child.   It's therefore all but a fool's errand to focus on individual mass shooters.  And we know that America is simply awash in firearms. This country has more guns than people, according to 2018 data from the Small Arms Survey. That ratio has likely only gotten more extreme after a spike in sales during the pandemic. Even with a drop in new gun purchases since the peak in 2020, estimated using background check data, there were at least 16.4 million guns purchased in 2022. That nothing resembling a cap on gun manufacturing or ownership exists is a testament to how deeply ingrained firearms are in both society and the economy.  Yes, mental health is a factor, despite it so often being deployed as a deflection from guns themselves. But if that explanation wasn't just a cover for inaction, we'd see Republicans in favor of stronger  red flag  laws that give courts the power to remove guns from homes where there's a danger of them being used against the owner or others. They'd push for stronger health care and treatment options for suicidal ideation, given that the No. 1 cause of firearm deaths is their owners turning a weapon on themselves. And if conservatives truly believe that all transgender Americans are mentally unwell, as has been suggested repeatedly to me in the last 24 hours as the real issue to focus on, then they should be working to help them, not demonize them.  The cliche from gun rights activists that a gun is merely a tool and it's the person who wields it that's the problem is inherently backward. Guns are weapons of destruction no matter who wields them. Their capacity to kill is not limited by identity or ideology. It's therefore all but a fool's errand to focus on individual mass shooters. In the end, it is only their ability to obtain these readily available instruments of death that unites them."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "Ron DeSantis is the political version of Clark Griswold", "text": "Virtually every feature written about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis speaks to a megalomania that's become apparent to folks who've watched the Republican over the years.  You've undoubtedly heard variations of this, perhaps framed this way: that DeSantis would be even worse than Donald Trump from a civil rights perspective, because he's a true adherent to a right-wing worldview (whereas Trump's adherence is more so out of political convenience). I think there's something to this theory.  DeSantis appears to relish the political minutiae in ways Trump doesn't. He seems to take delight in devising and effectuating specific plans to hurt political enemies.  To me, this is more a tactical difference from Trump than a moral one. DeSantis is more technically aware of how to wield political power in nefarious ways. And, dare I say, he's even more self-assured that these crazed political ambitions are actually wanted by the masses.  Despite backing policies restricting voting rights, access to health care and education, press freedoms and immigration, DeSantis remains insistent that Florida is a top destination because of what he has done.  Even Trump poked a hole in DeSantis' balloon on this front, noting in a social media post that Florida was an attraction long before its current governor arrived.   SUNSHINE AND OCEAN, very alluring!!!  he wrote.  DeSantis recently clapped back at Trump's mockery.   You can call me whatever you want ... as long as you also call me a winner,  the governor said in an interview.  And sure, for a certain type of political enthusiast -- the type who believes in winning at all costs, even at the cost of freedom -- DeSantis may seem like a godsend. But I find it odd that a man who boasts so much about winning is so clueless, or careless, about the fact that he has rigged the game in his favor.  Apparently, DeSantis believes being feared and being loved are one and the same. But there's something creepy about holding your opponents at (figurative) gunpoint and telling everyone this amounts to a good time for all involved.  In that light, I'd been searching for the perfect metaphor to convey the oddity of DeSantis' coercive politics and his jolly portrayal of these politics as desirable.  And then it hit me: Clark Griswold, Chevy Chase's character in  National Lampoon's Vacation.   In the movie, Clark has one goal: to get his family to the Walley World theme park. And he engages in all sorts of destruction en route to getting there, as his family frighteningly goes along for the ride.  The film comes to a head when the family finally reaches Walley World only to discover it's closed. Clark pulls a real-looking BB gun on a security guard and forces him to escort the Griswolds from ride to ride.  So, Walley World is executive power and Republicans are like the Griswolds being dragged along. Conservatives like DeSantis -- maybe even love him -- but they're a bit concerned by his recklessness, his awkwardness and, in some cases, even his possible disregard for the law as he pursues total control.  And, I insist, the creepy  aren't we having fun  energy is plentiful in both Clark Griswold and Ron DeSantis.  Remember, for example, that DeSantis overstepped right-wingers in the Florida Legislature last year to demand the passage of a gerrymandered map that diminished the power of Black voters even more than Florida Republicans had already planned.  And he demanded that lawmakers strip Disney of its special business classification after the company's CEO lightly defended LGBTQ people targeted by a DeSantis-backed law. Ultimately, lawmakers had to change course to avoid hurting local taxpayers.  It's noteworthy that DeSantis has out-crazied the Florida GOP on some fronts. And many conservatives are playing with fire by portraying him as a leader of their movement.  To the extent Republicans hitch their wagons to DeSantis, a potential presidential candidate, they're banking their political futures on -- and I want to be technical here -- a certified weirdo whose social skills and ability to persuade are even less impressive than the party's last presidential candidate's."}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "Why mapping Mars completely changed how we see it", "text": "Meet Mexico's 'forgotten panda.'

She's the last of her kind."}, {"source": "msnbc", "title": "Why DeSantis is struggling against Trump in the 2024 election", "text": "Ron DeSantis' honeymoon is over.  After his re-election in November, Florida's Republican governor cemented himself as the Republican establishment's great non-Trump hope. But even before he formally enters the presidential race, DeSantis' momentum has disappeared. Monmouth University's Republican primary poll shows a 15 point gain for former President Donald Trump since December, while DeSantis has dropped 12 points. Other surveys tell a similar story. NBC News reports that  a number of the Florida governor's donors and allies are worried his recent stumbles suggest he may not be ready.   How has DeSantis tripped up so spectacularly? As usual when it comes to Republican politics, the answer involves Trump. And DeSantis and the GOP establishment have once again played themselves.  Like many other Trump foes, he can't even settle on how to respond to Trump's attacks.  When DeSantis' poll numbers started rising, Trump wasted no time hurling attacks at his rival. He road-tested numerous nicknames, settling on  Ron DeSanctimonious.  He claimed -- without proof, of course -- that DeSantis had groomed high school students. And he even made, by Trump standards, an almost substantive case against DeSantis' actual record:   It's poorly written and has Trump's usual weird capitalization issues,  as MSNBC columnist Michael A. Cohen tweeted,  but it is also a pretty compelling argument against a DeSantis presidential bid.  It also has Trump's typical spin -- of course a president running for re-election got more votes in Florida than a governor running in a nonpresidential election year. But the inaccuracies and distortions only slightly weaken the attacks, because their thrust -- that DeSantis' views and actions are  a mirage  -- is accurate.  Like Derek Zoolander, DeSantis has only one look. If he has a Democrat or media straw man to light on fire, then he plays the angry fighter. But take that away, and he twists in the wind, waiting for Republican voters to tell him what they want.  DeSantis looks like a Bush Republican as much as or more than he does a Trump one,  writes The New York Times' Jamelle Bouie -- a diagnosis that reveals less about DeSantis' establishment lean than it does his ideological rootlessness. His recent twisting on the war in Ukraine echoes similar shifts on pandemic restrictions, entitlements and vaccines, to name just a few.  Such vacillating is largely a problem for the general election -- Mitt Romney in 2012 and John Kerry in 2004 are just two recent nominees who struggled to overcome past flip-flops. But for the GOP primary, DeSantis' indecision creates a different problem: Like many other Trump foes, he can't even settle on how to respond to Trump's attacks. For months, he tried to ignore Trump. Then he briefly tried to needle the president over his hush money case. Only in the last couple of days has DeSantis returned to citing his re-election, as he did late last year when his poll numbers were at their best.  The only way to beat Trump is to choose attacks early, dial them up to 11 and stick with them. In 2020, Joe Biden didn't hold back on the former president's racism, incompetence and corruption. The no-holds-barred approach doesn't always work -- ask Hillary Clinton -- but it fares far better than the approach his Republican foes used in 2016. But because DeSantis depends so heavily on the GOP base telling him what it wants, he's put himself at a disadvantage in trying to take on a candidate whom they still like.  An all-out attack on a primary rival is easier when you believe the candidate's nomination will be a grave mistake for the party.  This isn't only DeSantis' fault, though. It's the fault of the whole Republican establishment, and it goes back to the 2020 election. Trump may have insisted that he won the 2020 election primarily to assuage his own ego. But he also recognized that if Republican voters accepted that he was a  loser,  his brand was done.  Remember, DeSantis' post-midterm polling bump stemmed precisely from his re-election, in contrast to the serial losses of Trump's favorites -- defeats that went by and large unchallenged. Had Republican leaders rejected the conspiracy theories two years earlier and admitted (even tacitly) that Trump was a political loser, it could have permanently damaged his standing. Instead, they pre-emptively neutered their future champion's most compelling argument to the base: DeSantis won, and Trump didn't.  Why throw away this golden opportunity? Why flinch every time Trump swipes? Why refuse to win the only way you can against Trump -- by throwing the kitchen sink back at him? It's certainly not as if presidential primaries are conducted with a lighter touch -- ask anyone who witnessed the vicious contest between George W. Bush and John McCain.  An all-out attack on a primary rival is easier, though, when you believe the candidate's nomination will be a grave mistake for the party. And neither DeSantis nor the rest of the Republican establishment believes the man who instigated the attack on the Capitol is a threat to their party, let alone democracy. Some Republican politicians will privately bewail Trump anonymously to reporters. Some even tut-tutted him publicly once or twice after voting for most or all of his legislative agenda. Some will assure us in their future memoirs that they never liked him. But publicly, they'll sit on their hands and condemn their party to stay in Trump's hands.  Maybe DeSantis recovers between now and next February, when Iowa Republicans make their choices. But for now, he and the Republican establishment would rather doom their own chances than truly take on Trump. One can hope their strategy doesn't doom the country too."}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "How these feuding map-makers shaped our fascination with Mars", "text": "Today, humans have a clear-eyed view of Mars and its bleak, ruddy surface.

The clip from engineering firm Boston Dynamics was a hit, drawing 24 million views and counting. Watching it, you're likely to marvel at just how far robots have come--and wonder where they will go next.  That was the point of the video, said engineer Aaron Saunders: encouraging people to learn more about these machines and  imagine new ways in which robots could be useful in our daily lives.  At Carnegie Mellon University, researcher Manuela Veloso calls her team's creations  CoBots,  or collaborative robots, to emphasize their role in helping, rather than competing with, humans.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Already, robots are more common than you might think. They might not go around dancing on two legs, but intelligent machines can be found today in a variety of settings. They're assembling cars, harvesting crops, and possibly vacuuming your floors. The annual consumer electronics show, CES 2021, was filled with them: One product promises to help with home schooling; another will clean the swimming pool.  The coronavirus pandemic has ushered in yet another role for robots. One machine introduced last December is designed to disinfect places like hotels and restaurants with UV light, moving around furniture as it works. Others have been trained to monitor public spaces for social distancing and remind people of best practices for avoiding infection.  This robot revolution has been made possible by advances in the past few decades across multiple technology fronts: lighter mechanical parts; cheaper, better sensors; smaller and more sophisticated computers. The robots you're likely to see in the future are using capabilities already built into the latest cars, which can alert drivers to obstacles, detect blind spots, and steer within lanes on the road.  As a former Ford Motor Company executive, William  Bill  Santana Li saw this autonomous technology as a unique opportunity. He believed it would change the world, but not in the way many in the auto industry imagined. Did it really make sense to rush into self-driving cars which could be decades away? Li saw a different opportunity: Supporting law enforcement and private security.  0:15   'Everyone' is trying to go to Pluto first without perhaps first considering stopping at the moon,  he said.  Li's moon shot is Knightscope, the company he founded in 2013 to build Autonomous Security Robots ( ASRs ). Knightscope's five-foot tall, 400-pound machines can detect people, record footage, read license plates, and flag fire hazards, among other tasks--including monitoring for public health practices. Generating more than 90 terabytes of on-site data per year, Knightscope's security robots are meant to complement, not replace, people on the ground.   The idea is to have the machines do the monotonous and computationally heavy work and have the humans do the strategic and decision-making work,  Li said, noting that the 2 million people employed as police officers and security guards in the U.S. can't possibly protect a population of more than 328 million.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Knightscope's robots currently patrol corporate campuses, malls, hospitals, and other public places. When the police department in Huntington Park, California, deployed one of the company's outdoor security robots in 2019, crime reports dropped 46 percent and arrests went up 27 percent. In a separate incident on a corporate campus, a Knightscope robot was able to capture footage of an assault that stationary cameras didn't, aiding prosecution of the crime.  Knightscope is currently developing a multi-terrain security robot that it says could be helpful in settings such as airports, farms, prisons, and energy facilities. As with the other models Knightscope produces, the robots aren't meant to actively police people or apprehend suspects--instead, they serve as an extra set of eyes and ears. Their mere presence, Li said, can serve as a deterrent to anyone with criminal intentions. He wants people to think of robots as a friendly presence that can help make the country safer.

Here is a look at five players who will be counted on by their AHL teams down the stretch:  William Eklund, San Jose (San Jose Sharks)  The Sharks could have opted to keep Eklund on their roster for the rest of the regular season.  The 20-year-old forward showed more than enough promise during a two-week recall to the Sharks earlier this month. In those eight games, Eklund had two goals and an assist. He also averaged 19:50 time on ice per game, including an NHL career-high 22:17 against the St. Louis Blues on March 9.  The Sharks have been eliminated from contention for the Stanley Cup Playoffs, but their AHL affiliate is seven points out of a playoff spot in the Pacific Division. The Sharks returned Eklund to the AHL on March 19 to give him more time to help the affiliate qualify for the postseason.  Joel Hofer, Springfield (St. Louis Blues)  The goalie took a significant step forward last spring when Springfield went on a run to the Calder Cup final.  With Charlie Lindgren, then with the St. Louis organization, on recall to the Blues in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, Hofer handled all of the goaltending responsibilities for Springfield as a rookie.  Hofer came to the Blues organization as a fourth-round pick (No. 107) in the 2018 NHL Draft. Midway through his second pro season, St. Louis signed the 22-year-old to a two-year contract extension on Jan. 3.  Hofer got an extended look with the Blues on recall earlier this month and made 33 saves in a 3-0 win against the Winnipeg Jets on March 19. In five games with the Blues, he went 3-0-1 with a 2.79 goals-against average and .915 save percentage.  With Jordan Binnington back from a two-game suspension and the Blues 11 points behind Winnipeg for the second wild card in the West, St. Louis returned Hofer to Springfield. He is 23-14-4 with Springfield and is fourth in the AHL in save percentage (.920) and 11th in GAA (2.54). Even with the recall to St. Louis, his 40 games still tie him for third among AHL goalies.  Pyotr Kochetkov, Chicago (Carolina Hurricanes)  With Frederik Andersen and Antti Raanta set as the goalie tandem for the Hurricanes, Kochetkov can get more playing time with Chicago.  His return to Chicago on Wednesday comes at a most opportune time. The defending Calder Cup champion can make one final push for a playoff berth; they are six points behind Rockford (Chicago Blackhawks). With nine games to go, Chicago has two more head-to-head games.  The 23-year-old has excelled with Chicago in his 20 games with the team. He is 13-5-2 with a 2.39 GAA and .916 save percentage. In 24 games for the Hurricanes, he is 12-7-5 with a 2.44 GAA and .909 save percentage. Carolina, sitting atop the Metropolitan Division, selected him in the second round (No. 36) of the 2019 NHL Draft.  Akira Schmid, Utica (New Jersey Devils)  Utica has its goaltending tandem in place once again.  New Jersey, in competition for the Metropolitan Division title, returned Akira Schmid on Saturday. That same night, Nico Daws also returned to the Utica lineup and had 35 saves in a 1-0 shootout loss to Rochester (Buffalo Sabres).  With Mackenzie Blackwood back from injury, the Devils opted to send Schmid down rather than go with a three-goalie system. The 22-year-old has not played an AHL game since Feb. 19. A fifth-round pick (No. 136) in 2018, Schmid played well with the Devils. In 17 games this season for New Jersey, he is 8-5-2 with a 2.24 GAA and .918 save percentage. He's 10-6-3 with a 2.53 GAA and .908 save percentage in 20 games for Utica.  Utica trying to fend off both Syracuse (Tampa Bay Lightning) and Rochester for second place in the North Division with eight games to go in the regular season.  Cole Sillinger, Cleveland (Columbus Blue Jackets)  After 143 NHL games, Sillinger got his first look at the AHL this past weekend.  The 19-year-old forward had gone through a trying season with the Blue Jackets, who have been eliminated from the playoffs. In 64 games with Columbus, he had 11 points (three goals, eight assists). As a rookie last season, he had 31 points (16 goals, 15 assists) in 79 games.  Sillinger, who went to Columbus at No. 12 in the 2021 NHL Draft, will get heavy minutes with Cleveland, another team fighting for a playoff berth in the North Division. He played three games in three days this past weekend and had three assists.  Cleveland is one point behind ahead of Laval (Montreal Canadiens) for the fifth and final playoff spot in the North Division."}, {"source": "nhl-news", "title": "Stanley Cup Playoff clinching scenarios for March 30", "text": "Here are the Stanley Cup Playoffs clinching scenarios for March 30:  EASTERN CONFERENCE  The Boston Bruins will clinch the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference and the Presidents' Trophy:  If they defeat the Columbus Blue Jackets in any fashion (7 p.m. ET; SN360, NESN, BSOH, ESPN+, SN NOW).

With favorite snacks and a small mountain of wipes at the ready, parents pack up strollers, ignore the chorus of  Are we there yet?  and set out to show their kids the world. They do it for the same reasons they demand kids eat their vegetables or finish their homework--they believe it's good for them.  (Here's how families can make the most out of spring break this year.)  That doesn't change when you're a Black family, but there are a few more considerations.  Will we be stared at or accosted in places where few people look like us? Will other people see innocence in our children or treat them according to stereotypes that fill television and movie screens? Will our child's behavior be viewed as  just a kid being a kid  or intentionally problematic? Will our family feel safe?  In spite of those fears--and sometimes because of them--they travel anyway.   We're just like any other traveling family out there, even though sometimes the experience on the ground might be a little bit more challenging for us because of the color of our skin,  says Metanoya Webb, who lives in New York but travels extensively with her son, Journey, age 4.   No matter how early the introduction, I just knew how valuable it would be for him as a Black male coming up in America to have the gift of travel,  she says.  The Black Lives Matter movement and recent storming of Capitol Hill have shone a light on the racial tensions that remain in America, and for Black families traveling with young children, it adds another consideration to travel decision-making.

Photograph courtesy Montoya Hudson, Memphis Travel  A recent study by marketing agency MMGY Global found that concern about safety is an overwhelming (more than 70 percent) concern for Black travelers.   We avoid most small towns unless we've done extensive research on the population there (how many are people of color, what does their police department look like, any negative stories in the news, etc.),  says Montoya Hudson, the chief writer at The Spring Break Family, via email.  If we're unsure, we don't go.   (Life after the 'Green Book': What is the future for Black travelers in America?)  But the number of Black family travelers is growing, particularly young families. According to MMGY Global, 12 percent of Black travel parties are comprised of young families, which is greater than the incidence of young families among all U.S. resident travelers.  The reasons why Black families travel, despite the risks, is as much about the past as it is about the future.  Getting a fuller sense of history   Our history, our culture, and our impact are downplayed,  says Hudson.  If I allowed my children to learn only what is taught in school, then they would think we began with slavery. Traveling fixes that.   For Hudson, taking her daughters to Memphis, Tennessee, and showing them the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated, was an impactful way of helping them understand the Civil Rights movement.  (Take a road trip along Alabama's Civil Rights Trail.)   Travel allows for some of the more positive lessons around Black history that are often left out of the schoolbooks,  says Hudson.  Even with some of the brutal experiences in our history, they can see that we've not only endured, but flourished. That's important.   Tiffany Miller, who--along with her husband and three kids--travels as The NonRev Family, says they have already visited the National Museum of African American Culture and History in Washington, D.C., three times and would happily return. Places like the National Museum of African American Music, which debuted in Nashville last year, and the forthcoming International African American Museum, in Charleston, South Carolina, are bound to have a similar impact when families begin to travel again.  1:45  Black family travelers also laud sites and museums that offer a fuller version of events than textbooks provide. The Whitney Plantation, in Louisiana, tells the history of slavery in America from the perspective of the enslaved people. The Legacy Museum, in Montgomery, Alabama, explains the economic forces that took Black people from slavery to prison. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and National Historical Park explores the iconic abolitionist's legacy and experience growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore.   Many Black children don't live in an area with multicultural, high-performing schools, or with access to diverse cuisine or experiences outside of their normal day-to-day,  Miller says,  so it's even more important for our Black children to travel.   Finding community  Stephanie Claytor, a lifelong traveler and the author of Blacktrekking: My Journey Living in Latin America, says that even though her son, Kyler, is only 10 months old, she is already thinking about the places she wants to take him.   It is very important for me to show and introduce my child to Black people from around the world, as well as expose him to their history and culture,  Claytor says.  This exposure will teach him that he can be anything he wants to be and live anywhere in the world. He is not confined to Tampa Bay, Florida, where he was born. The world is his.   For her part, Metanoya Webb says that visiting Cuba with her son, and seeing a country filled with people who had skin and hair similar to his own, was affirming.  There was some sort of familiarity that made him comfortable,  Webb says.   As Black children, especially ones growing up in the South, things can sometimes feel limiting,  says Hudson,  but allowing them to see other areas where race isn't the same social construct that it is here, or where Black communities are thriving, really broadens their horizons.   Finding Black community legacy in places where it isn't always expected is also empowering. In Ontario, Canada, families can visit Chatham-Kent, the home of Josiah Henson, whose story of escaping slavery inspired Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin. Henson was also one of the masterminds behind the Dawn Settlement, a successful Free Black community. In Nova Scotia, families can learn about the early 19th-century Africville at a museum located on the site of the government-bulldozed, all-Black neighborhood. (A formal apology was issued in 2010.)  In Indianapolis, families can explore the legacy of one of the country's richest self-made millionaires, Madam C.J. Walker, starting with a new mural celebrating her at the Indianapolis airport.  (Here is why diversity in travel matters.)  Seeing yourself in the world can provide new opportunities for self-confidence and pride. Imani Bashir says global travels with her husband and their son Nasir, 3, have allowed them to show him the intellect and talent of people  just like him.    The pyramids of Giza are a must for Black children,  says Bashir.  They need to see that we built such amazing civilizations even that long ago.   Creating new narratives  Sometimes travel, domestic or international, is less about the sites you see and more about showing your kids that they can be there too.  Casey Palmer lives with his wife, Sarah, and their children, Isaiah, 7, and Xavier, 5, in Toronto, Canada. The mixed-race family loves the outdoors. Recent trips have included Arrowhead Provincial Park, north of the city, and Pinery Provincial Park on Lake Huron.  Bumping into another Black family in the wild has been rare, says Palmer, who is working on a book about Black fatherhood slated for release in 2022. And that's one of the reasons he continues to get out there with his sons--to show them Black people camp, too.  (Learn about how national parks are working to fight racism.)   The world is a big place, and I don't want myself or my children to feel boxed in by any restrictions that come from their upbringing or something someone tells them,  says Palmer, who adds he hopes to be able to take his kids to climb Mount Kilimanjaro when they're older.

OR  If the Predators lose to the Penguins in regulation.  On Tap  There are 11 games on the NHL schedule Thursday, 10 with playoff implications.  Columbus Blue Jackets at Boston Bruins (7 p.m. ET; SN360, NESN, BSOH, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Bruins (57-12-5) can lock up the Presidents' Trophy and set a new team record for wins in a season by defeating the Blue Jackets at TD Garden. Columbus (23-43-7) has been eliminated from playoff contention.  Florida Panthers at Montreal Canadiens (7 p.m. ET; TSN2, RDS, BSFL, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Panthers (37-31-7) are one point behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second wild card into the playoffs from the Eastern Conference after defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs 3-2 in overtime on Wednesday. Panthers goalie Sergei Bobrovsky did not play against Toronto because of a non-COVID illness. He went to Montreal on Wednesday and could play at Bell Centre. The Canadiens (30-39-6) have been eliminated from postseason contention.  New York Rangers at New Jersey Devils (7 p.m. ET; MSGSN, MSG, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Devils (46-20-8) have a two-point lead on the Rangers (44-20-10) for second place in the Metropolitan Division. New Jersey is three points behind the Carolina Hurricanes for first; New York is five back. The Rangers are 9-1-1 in their past 11 games and can move into a second place tie with a regulation win at Prudential Center. The Devils are 2-4-2 in their past eight games.  Nashville Predators at Pittsburgh Penguins (7 p.m. ET; ATTSN-PT, BSSO, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Penguins (36-28-10) are trying to hold onto the second wild card from the East. They are one point ahead of the Panthers. The Predators (37-28-8), coming off a 2-1 win at the Bruins on Tuesday, are three points behind the Winnipeg Jets for the second wild card into the playoffs from the Western Conference with two games in hand.  Philadelphia Flyers at Ottawa Senators (7 p.m. ET; TSN5, RDS2, NBCSP, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Senators (36-33-5) are five points behind the Penguins for the second wild card from the East and will be without defenseman Thomas Chabot potentially for the rest of the regular season. Chabot sustained an upper-body injury in the third period of a 5-2 win against the Panthers on Monday. The Flyers (29-32-12) have won four straight games but are 12 points out of a playoff spot with nine games to play.  Washington Capitals at Tampa Bay Lightning (7 p.m. ET; BSSUN, NBCSWA, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Lightning (43-26-6) are six points behind the Maple Leafs for second place in the Atlantic Division. Toronto has a game in hand. The Capitals (34-32-9) are five points behind the Penguins for the second wild card in the East with seven games to play after losing 2-1 in a shootout to the New York Islanders on Wednesday.  Carolina Hurricanes at Detroit Red Wings (7:30 p.m. ET; ESPN+, HULU, SN NOW)  The Hurricanes (47-17-9) are trying to hold onto first place in the Metropolitan Division. They can stay at least three points ahead of the Devils with a win. They can also move four or five points ahead of New Jersey with a win and a Devils loss to the Rangers. The Red Wings (32-32-9) are nine points out of a playoff spot with nine games to play.  Los Angeles Kings at Edmonton Oilers (9 p.m. ET; SNW, BSSC, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Kings (43-21-10) are second in the Pacific Division with 96 points in 74 games, one more point in one fewer game than the Oilers (43-23-9). They each trail the Vegas Golden Knights, who have 98 points in 74 games. Edmonton will move into second place in the Pacific with a regulation win.  Anaheim Ducks at Seattle Kraken (10 p.m. ET; ESPN+, HULU, SN360, SN NOW)  A win and the Kraken (40-25-8) would inch closer to their first playoff berth. Seattle is in position to be the first wild card into the playoffs from the Western Conference with 88 points in 73 games. They are three points ahead of the Winnipeg Jets, who hold the second wild card, and five points ahead of the Calgary Flames. The Ducks (23-41-10) have lost five in a row and have been eliminated from playoff contention.  Vegas Golden Knights at San Jose Sharks (10:30 p.m. ET; NBCSCA, ATTSN-RM, ESPN+, SN NOW)  The Golden Knights (46-22-6) can clinch a playoff berth and stay in first place in the Pacific Division with a win against the Sharks (20-39-15). San Jose played spoiler with a 3-0 win against Winnipeg on Tuesday, ending a nine-game losing streak (0-6-3). The Sharks have been eliminated from playoff contention.  If playoffs started Thursday  Here is a look at the matchups for the first round as they stand entering games Thursday:  Eastern Conference  (1A) Boston Bruins vs. (WC2) Pittsburgh Penguins  (1M) Carolina Hurricanes vs. (WC1) New York Islanders  (2A) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (3A) Tampa Bay Lightning  (2M) New Jersey Devils vs. (3M) New York Rangers  Western Conference  (1P) Vegas Golden Knights vs. (WC2) Winnipeg Jets  (1C) Minnesota Wild vs. (WC1) Seattle Kraken  (2C) Dallas Stars vs. (3C) Colorado Avalanche  (2P) Los Angeles Kings vs. (3P) Edmonton Oilers  About Last Night  There were three games Wednesday, each with playoff implications.  Florida Panthers 3, Toronto Maple Leafs 2 (OT): Brandon Montour scored 1:41 into overtime after Sam Reinhart scored a game-tying power-play goal with 1:00 remaining in the third period at Scotiabank Arena, ending the Panthers' four-game losing streak. Florida (37-31-7) is one point behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference with seven games to play. The Penguins have a game in hand. Alex Lyon made 38 saves, playing because Sergei Bobrovsky was out with a non-COVID illness. With the one point earned, the Maple Leafs (44-20-10) increased their lead to six points over the Tampa Bay Lightning for second place in the Atlantic Division with eight games remaining. Toronto has a game in hand.  New York Islanders 2, Washington Capitals 1 (SO): Kyle Palmieri scored the shootout-deciding goal in the second round and Ilya Sorokin preserved it with a save on Nicklas Backstrom in the third round to lift the Islanders to the win at Capital One Arena. The Islanders (39-28-9) moved five points ahead of the Penguins for the first wild card from the East with six games remaining. The Penguins have two games in hand. By getting one point, the Capitals (34-32-9) moved within five points of the Penguins for the second wild card with seven games to play.  Minnesota Wild 4, Colorado Avalanche 2:The Wild (44-22-9) increased their lead for first place in the Central Division to three points with the win at Ball Arena. Frederick Gaudreau became the first player in Wild history to score two shorthanded goals in the same game. Sam Steel and Marcus Johansson each scored, and Filip Gustavsson made 42 saves, including 18 on 19 shots in the third period. Minnesota is 8-0-3 on the road since Feb. 23. Bowen Byram and Lars Eller scored for the Avalanche (44-23-6), who remain tied for second in the Central with the Dallas Stars. Each has 94 points in 74 games."}, {"source": "nhl-news", "title": "Hobey Baker finalists includes top 2023 NHL Draft prospect Fantilli", "text": "Adam Fantilli, a top prospect for the 2023 Upper Deck NHL Draft, is one of three finalists for the Hobey Baker Award, given annually to the best NCAA men's ice hockey player.  The other finalists are University of Minnesota forwards Logan Cooley (Arizona Coyotes) and Matthew Knies (Toronto Maple Leafs).  The winner will be announced at the Frozen Four in Tampa, Florida, on April 7 (6 p.m. ET; NHLN).  Fantilli leads NCAA Division I players with 64 points (29 goals, 35 assists) in 35 games. That includes the game-tying goal for Michigan in its 2-1 overtime win against Penn State in an NCAA Tournament regional final March 26 that sent the Wolverines to the Frozen Four.  Michigan will play Quinnipiac in the national semifinals on April 6.  Fantilli also was named Big Ten Freshman of the Year, First-Team All-Conference and made the All-Freshman Team.   Honestly, [the Hobey Baker Award] never crossed my mind, even in the offseason,  Fantilli said.  With the guys coming back in the Big Ten, I didn't even think about it. I was trying to have the best rookie year, trying to have the best freshman year I could have. So the fact I'm in the conversation for that is an honor and I'm really grateful for it.   The 18-year-old center is No. 2 on NHL Central Scouting's midterm ranking of North American skaters presented by BioSteel.   I would say No. 1, it's just his compete level,  Michigan coach Brandon Naurato said on the  NHL Draft Class  podcast.  He's such a competitive kid on and off the ice, wants to win every race and battle in the game, every small-area game in practice. And he has such a high-end motor. ... He's always going 100 mph all the time.   Cooley, selected by the Coyotes with the No. 3 pick in the 2022 NHL Draft, is second among NCAA players with 57 points (20 goals, 37 assists) in 37 games. He was named Big Ten First-Team All-Conference and to the conference's All-Freshman Team.  The 18-year-old scored the game-winning goal in Minnesota's 4-1 win against St. Cloud State in a regional final March 25. Minnesota will play Boston University in the second national semifinal on April 6.  The winners of the semifinals will play for the NCAA championship on April 8.  Knies, selected by the Maple Leafs in the second round (No. 57) of the 2021 NHL Draft, is tied for seventh among NCAA players with 21 goals in 38 games, and tied for first with seven game-winning goals. The 20-year-old was named Big Ten Player of the Year and Big Ten First-Team All-Conference.

NHL.com has you covered with all the latest news.  Ottawa Senators  Cam Talbot could make his return against the Philadelphia Flyers on Thursday (7 p.m. ET; TSN5, RDS2, NBCSP, ESPN+, SN NOW).  The goalie, who hasn't played since March 4 because of a mid-body injury, faced shots in the goal usually defended by starter during the morning skate. Coach D.J. Smith said the Senators will make a game-time decision on which goaltender, Talbot or Mads Sogaard, will start.   He's come back [from injury] every time and been really solid,  Smith said of Talbot.  I mean, he's been solid for a lot of games for us. He carried us through December, but so has [Sogaard] as of late as well. These are tough decisions. We know the situation that we're in with how many games [are left] and what we think we'd have to win to possibly have a chance, and we're going to need both of them.   Talbot is 15-14-1 with a 2.84 goals-against average and .905 save percentage in 32 games this season. On Wednesday, Talbot said he felt  really good  in practice.   To be back for this, the last eight games or so, whatever it is, it's huge,  Talbot said.  I've been working to be a part of this. I didn't want to be out for the year and stuff like that. I've put in a lot of work in the last few weeks just to make sure I was back to at least be a part of it.   Defenseman Thomas Chabot could be out the rest of the regular season because of an upper-body injury. He left during the third period of a 5-2 win against the Florida Panthers on Monday after taking a hit by Panthers forward Givani Smith.  The Senators (36-33-5) are five points behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for the second wild card into the Stanley Cup Playoffs from the Eastern Conference. Each team has eight games remaining. -- Callum Fraser  St. Louis Blues  Pavel Buchnevich and Robert Thomas will not play for the Blues against the Blackhawks (8:30 p.m. ET; NBCSCH, BSMW, ESPN+, SN NOW).  Each forward is out with an upper-body injury.   Thomas has been dealing with something, so they both will not be players tomorrow,  St. Louis coach Craig Berube said Wednesday.  Thomas maybe (could play Saturday). That's all I know.   Buchnevich had a goal and an assist in 19:10 of ice time in a 6-5 overtime win against the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday. Thomas scored a goal in 15:53 of ice time.  Buchnevich is second on the Blues with 66 points (25 goals, 41 assists) in 59 games this season; Thomas is third with 63 points (17 goals, 46 assists) in 70 games.  Kasperi Kapanen will shift from wing to center against the Blackhawks.   It's new for him. We'll see how he does,  Berube said.  He hasn't really [played center], probably when he was young, but he's got a good head. He's pretty solid defensively, and I feel like he's the best guy to do the job.  -- Lou Korac  Toronto Maple Leafs  Ryan O'Reilly's return from a broken finger is getting closer for the Maple Leafs, and coach Sheldon Keefe did not rule out the possibility that he could be back this week.   Just to continue to ramp him up and make sure things respond positively both as he is shooting more, handling pucks more and then also just making sure he's safe in terms of minimizing risk for re-injury,  Keefe said Tuesday.  ... I would call it unlikely to play this week but that hasn't been ruled out necessarily. I think the plan is more to ramp him up through this week and then look more towards next (week to return to play).   The center took part in the optional morning skate Wednesday before the Maple Leafs lost 3-2 in overtime to the Panthers. He has not played since March 4, when he sustained the injury during a 4-1 loss to the Canucks. O'Reilly had surgery and the initial time frame for a return was four weeks.  He took part in a skill development session that included handling and shooting pucks with teammates Tuesday but departed before the main session began.   Today he didn't practice, but he did everything but practice and he got a lot of work in individually himself before we even got out there,  Keefe said.  The hope is he will continue to progress towards practice here.   O'Reilly has five points (three goals, two assists) in eight games with the Maple Leafs since being acquired in a trade with the St. Louis Blues on Feb. 17.  Forward Noel Acciari did not practice Tuesday after sustaining an undisclosed injury during a 3-2 win against the Nashville Predators on Sunday. He skated on his own Wednesday but did not play against the Panthers.   He's day to day at this point,  Keefe said Tuesday. -- Dave McCarthy"}, {"source": "national-geographic", "title": "A new sensation: recording and reproducing taste", "text": "Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the phonograph, becoming the first person ever to record and reproduce his own voice. In 1895, the Edison Company created one of the earliest sound  movies --a 17-second clip that showed one man playing a violin while two others danced nearby. For 125 years, in other words, it has been possible to record audio and visual scenes and play them back with reasonably high fidelity. But in the entire history of humanity, there has been no way of recording and reproducing the taste of a food or beverage--that is until last year with the advent of Homei Miyashita's  Taste Display.  The invention by Miyashita, a scientist at Meiji University in Tokyo, is a 21st-century analogue of a phonograph--one that plays back tastes rather than sounds.  Miyashita has a longstanding interest in food and taste. His curiosity about ingredients was piqued as a child when his mother wrote a recipe book. He has carried out his own research at Meiji University as one of the founders of the Frontier Media Science program, which explores the interface between technology and the human senses. In 2012, he and a former PhD student Hiromi Nakamura (now on the University of Tokyo faculty), developed an  electric fork  that was originally intended to enhance the flavor of hospital food--the idea being to make food taste saltier, for instance, without actually adding salt, thereby avoiding possibly adverse health consequences.  That was an early step for Miyashita, who had bigger, more ambitious plans. Whereas the electric fork could make food taste saltier or sourer, the Taste Display could reproduce any flavor one might care to conjure up. Here's how it works, starting with a bit of anatomy: The human tongue has separate receptors for detecting the five basic tastes--sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Miyashita's device has five different gels, each containing an electrolyte solution that causes the tongue, upon contacting the surface, to sense one of those flavors at an intensity that is readily adjustable. Each gel is connected to a separate (exceedingly weak) electric current, and the taste associated with that gel diminishes when the current is turned up. A sixth, tasteless gel is also included as a buffer that keeps the overall current level--and the associated stimulation of the tongue--constant at all times.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited. Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  By adjusting the current strengths for all six gels, which can be done automatically, the taste of a chocolate milkshake or a sirloin steak or any other desired treat can be experienced through the use of this device without any caloric intake.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  The Taste Display initially took the form of a rod that resembles a hand-held microphone with a surface that's designed to be licked rather than talked into. But Miyashita already has an early version of a mask, which affords a user continuous contact with the flavor-imparting surface, as part of a virtual reality system. He also has developed a  lickable screen  that can be incorporated onto a cell phone, allowing a person to watch a cooking show, for example, while tasting various samples.   Or someone looking at a recipe on a website could find out what that dish tastes like,  he says.  We now have smartphones with cameras, displays, microphones, and speakers. But we'll soon be able to go further and upload and download our taste experiences.   That's a brief introduction to the taste reproduction part of the story, but what about the recording end of things? Miyashita is currently using commercially available  taste sensors  that provide a quantitative measure of the five flavor components of any food that is sampled. He developed equations that convert that taste data into a corresponding current strength for each of the five flavors.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Present-day taste sensors are bulky machines that are rather slow at turning out results. Miyashita is exploring faster, more portable ways of taste recording--perhaps through the use of a thermometer-like device that can be dipped into food, giving quick readouts of the distinct flavor components. A portable  salt-meter  like this already exists, and it could be adapted to measure other flavors too. Within 10 years, he predicts, we should be able to instantly record and reproduce taste information.  Eating, however, is about more than just sensing the five basic flavors in their myriad combinations. Smell is also an important part of the gustatory experience, and Miyashita is already experimenting with  smell displays.  He's also looking into the sensation of touch, examining how a particular food feels in your mouth. To this end, he's working on 3D printing, using not just smooth plastic but a range of materials that have varying degrees of roughness.  By combining that with our taste research,  he says,  we hope to reproduce the texture you feel while eating.   Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.   But there's only so much you can do,  he admits.  You could watch a travel video, but that probably won't eliminate your desire to visit a foreign land. Nor would listening to a record necessarily satisfy your urge to hear live music.  And so, too, it is with taste. Technology can, of course, do marvelous things--his lab being a prime example. But there's also something to be said for a good home-cooked meal, Miyashita says, perhaps drawn from the pages of his mother's recipe book."}, {"source": "nhl-news", "title": "Super 16: Bruins No. 1 in power rankings; questions before playoffs begin", "text": "The New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers could be on a collision course to face off in the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the sixth time in NHL history and first time in 11 years.  The New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers could be on a collision course to face off in the Stanley Cup Playoffs for the sixth time in NHL history and first time in 11 years.  The teams that make up the  Hudson River Rivalry  nearly collided in the Super 16 power rankings this week.  The Devils are ahead of the Rangers by one voting point, 152-151, but down one spot from last week to No. 4 this week. New York, which had won three straight before a 2-1 loss to New Jersey at Prudential Center on Thursday, are up three spots to No. 5.  The Boston Bruins, to nobody's surprise, are again the unanimous No. 1. It's the fifth consecutive week the Bruins are the unanimous No. 1 among the 13 voters who participate in the Super 16 rankings each week. It's their 20th straight week atop the Super 16.  They clinched the Presidents' Trophy as the team with the best regular season record in the NHL and set a Bruins record for wins in a season with 58 in a 2-1 overtime win against the Columbus Blue Jackets at TD Garden on Thursday. Boston won 57 games in 1970-71 before a seven-game loss to the Montreal Canadiens in the Quarterfinals.  But the Bruins, like the Devils, Rangers and the other 13 teams ranked this week, all have questions they need to answer before the 2023 playoffs begin. For some, the questions need to be answered ASAP if they plan to just simply get in the playoffs.  That's the theme this week for the Super 16, the one big question facing each team as the regular season grinds to a close in the next two weeks.  As a reminder, to come up with the Super 16 each week, the 13 voters put together their own version of what they think the rankings should look like. A point total assigned to each with the team selected first is given 16 points, second 15, third 14, and so on down the line.  Here it is, with a participating voter writing about one big question facing each team.  1. Boston Bruins (58-12-5)  Total points: 208  Last week: No. 1   Uh? Have they peaked? Are they too good? Will they run into the curse of the Presidents' Trophy? Seriously, though, it's pretty tough to come up with questions for a team that has been this good all season. But I'll dig deep and find one: What are the Bruins going to do with their goaltending, both down the stretch and into the Stanley Cup Playoffs? It sounds like a ridiculous question when their top goalie, Linus Ullmark, is the projected favorite for the Vezina Trophy awarded to the best in the NHL at his position, but Jeremy Swayman has been no slouch. He's won his past four straight games, allowing five goals on 130 shots (.962 save percentage). Not a bad guy to have sitting on the bench, just in case.  -- Amalie Benjamin, staff writer  Video: Friedman joins NHL Tonight to talk Bruins' dominance  2. Carolina Hurricanes (47-18-9)  Total points: 184  Last week: No. 2   The biggest question for the Hurricanes heading into their final eight games is if they'll be able to find enough consistency and hold onto first place in the Metropolitan Division. They lead the Devils by one point and the Rangers by five with one game in hand on each. The Hurricanes have struggled of late, going 4-6-1 in their past 11 games and allowing at least three goals in nine of them. If the Devils weren't also going through a rough patch (3-4-2 in their past nine), the Hurricanes might have already dropped out of first. But the Rangers are 9-2-1 in their past 12, so Carolina needs to string some wins together to head into the playoffs with some momentum and avoid dropping into a more difficult first-round series against New York or New Jersey.  -- Tom Gulitti, staff writer  3. Colorado Avalanche (44-24-6)  Total points: 156  Last week: No. 5   Will the Avalanche be healthy, or healthier, when the playoffs begin? Injuries have been a massive part of their season, but they haven't let them be their plague. They are still pushing for first place in the Central Division, still one of the best teams in the NHL and still have forwards Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen, and defenseman Cale Makar. Alexandar Georgiev has proven himself as a No. 1 goalie, at least in the regular season. But to make a run at a repeat Stanley Cup championship, Colorado needs all its weapons. Will forward Gabriel Landeskog be able to play in the postseason? He has missed the entire regular season following offseason knee surgery. Will they have forward Artturi Lehkonen (finger) back in the first round? What about defenseman Josh Manson (lower body)? If the answer is yes to all three, the Avalanche could be primed for another Cup run. If it's no to any of them, it'll be harder.  -- Dan Rosen, senior writer  4. New Jersey Devils (47-20-8)  Total points: 152  Last week: No. 3   The Devils need to play with a little more consistency, particularly on the defensive side of the puck. They've been outscored 30-24 in their past nine games. Goaltending, an area that wasn't much of a concern earlier this month, has been average at best, and average just won't cut it in the postseason. Forward Timo Meier, acquired in a trade with the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 26, has seven points (five goals, two assists; 0.50 points per game) while averaging 18:10 of ice time in 14 games since joining the Devils. The 26-year-old was averaging 0.91 points and 19:59 of ice time in 57 games for the Sharks.  -- Mike G. Morreale, staff writer  5. New York Rangers (44-21-10)  Total points: 151  Last week: No. 8   Igor Shesterkin is on top of his game, sharpening up at just the right time. The Rangers goalie is 9-3-0 with a 2.07 goals-against average, .932 save percentage and one shutout in 12 starts since Feb. 26. He had allowed at least three goals in seven straight starts from Jan. 25-Feb. 25 for a 3.85 GAA and .863 save percentage. The fact that Shesterkin is playing his best now bodes well for the Rangers, but the biggest question they face is still in the defensive zone and if they will be able to clean up some of their play in front of him. They're still prone to lapses in the 'D' zone that force Shesterkin to make 10-bell saves. Captain Jacob Trouba said after a 6-2 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday that it's becoming too consistent of a theme, that they have to protect Shesterkin instead of always being so reliant on him. The Rangers have enough skill and scoring to do a lot of damage in the playoffs and go on a long run if they can tighten up in the defensive zone.  -- Rosen  Video: The NHL Tonight crew talks big playoff picture  6. Vegas Golden Knights (46-22-7)  Total points: 150  Last week: No. 4   The question with Vegas, at this point, is if 37-year-old goalie Jonathan Quick has another long playoff run in him. Logan Thompson has played only one game since Feb. 9 because of an injury, and didn't finish it, getting injured again against the Calgary Flames on March 23. It doesn't look serious, and hopefully the rookie goalie will be ready when the playoffs begin April 17. If not, Quick will have to answer the bell. He won the Stanley Cup twice with the Los Angeles Kings in 2012 and 2014 and will get the chance to get his third ring, only this time in the desert.  -- Robert Laflamme, LNH.com senior writer  7. Los Angeles Kings (43-22-10)  Total points: 133  Last week: No. 6   Who will start Game 1 of the Western Conference First Round regardless of who the Kings play? Pheonix Copley and Joonas Korpisalo had alternated for 12 games before Korpisalo started the past two, including a 2-0 loss at the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday. They've both been solid, save for Copley allowing six goals on 22 shots in a 7-6 win against the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. He is 5-0-1 with a 2.31 GAA and .902 save percentage in that stretch; it was 1.58 and .934 before he allowed six to St. Louis. Korpisalo has been better; 4-2-1, 1.86 GAA and .934 save percentage in seven starts since Los Angeles acquired him in a trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets on Feb. 28. The Kings have seven games left to make a decision on their Game 1 starter while they continue to battle for first place in the Pacific Division.  -- Rosen  8. Minnesota Wild (44-22-9)  Total points: 130  Last week: No. 9   The Wild have their fingers crossed for superstar forward Kirill Kaprizov, who has missed 10 games with a lower-body injury Yes, the Wild are 7-1-2 in those games. Yes, they have scored 4.2 goals per game in that time span, third in the NHL. And yes, Matt Boldy has stepped into the breech, scoring 11 goals in those 10 games. But the Wild, who have not advanced past the first round since 2015, will need every gamebreaker they can get to defeat the quality opponent they will draw. Nobody is better at that than Kaprizov, who scored seven goals in a six-game series loss to the Blues in the 2022 Western Conference First Round. Will he be back, healthy, and ready to go for Game 1?  -- Shawn P. Roarke, senior director of editorial  9. Toronto Maple Leafs (44-20-10)  Total points: 124  Last week: No. 7   Can one goalie, specifically Ilya Samsonov, find momentum that can be carried into the playoffs? Though there has been recent debate among Maple Leafs fans and media as to who that goalie should be, it says here that Samsonov should easily get the nod. Matt Murray has allowed four goals in seven of his previous eight games and Samsonov is 24-9-4 in 37 games (36 starts) this season. The choice seems obvious. Now the goal must be getting Samsonov back into form after he missed a past week for the birth of his son; he made 26 saves in a 3-2 loss to the Florida Panthers on Wednesday. With center Steven Stamkos, forward Nikita Kucherov and the Tampa Bay Lightning appearing to be Toronto's first round opponent again, goaltending, as always, will be a key.  -- Mike Zeisberger, staff writer  10. Edmonton Oilers (44-23-9)  Total points: 89  Last week: No. 12   It takes goaltending and defensive depth to go on a long run in the playoffs, and those would be my two biggest concerns surrounding the Oilers heading into April. Their skill up front is unquestioned. They are averaging an NHL-best 3.95 goals per game but also allowing 3.29 goals-against per game. Everything tightens up come playoff time, so Edmonton will need to be stronger at keeping the puck out of its own end when the postseason gets underway.  -- Brian Compton, managing editor  11. Dallas Stars (40-20-14)  Total points: 83  Last week: No. 10   I guess the biggest question for the Stars right now is will goalie Jake Oettinger's workload lighten at all heading into the playoffs? It depends on the health of backup Scott Wedgewood, who has been out since Feb. 18 with an undisclosed injury. If Wedgewood can come back, and Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said he's close to doing so, it would be a good chance to rest Oettinger, who has played an NHL career-high 56 games (55 starts) this season. Oettinger was outstanding in the first round last season, his work almost pushing the Stars past the Calgary Flames in seven games. He's been great, and the Stars want him healthy and as fresh as possible going into the postseason.  -- Tracey Myers, staff writer  12. Tampa Bay Lightning (44-26-6)  Total points: 76  Last week: No. 11   Could time finally be catching up with the Lightning? The grind of playing 71 playoff games the past three seasons finally could be showing itself because they have not looked like the same team the past few months. They're 21-15-5 since Jan. 1. They've won consecutive games twice since Feb. 9-14; they won three straight from March 14-18, but that preceded a four-game losing streak. Their 5-1 win against the Washington Capitals on Thursday salvaged a .500 points percentage for March. Might Tampa Bay be biding its time? The Lightning certainly have the knowledge baked into them of how hard to push on the accelerator at certain points during a season, and maybe they've eased off the gas pedal a bit. But their core group -- Stamkos, Kucherov and center Brayden Point, defensemen Victor Hedman and Mikhail Sergachev and goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy -- have played a lot of hockey. It's fair to wonder how much gas is left in their tank.  -- Adam Kimelman, deputy managing editor  13. New York Islanders (39-28-9)  Total points: 48  Last week: No. 14   What's up with Mathew Barzal and will the Islanders' top center be back for the postseason, provided they get there, of course? The Islanders hold the first wild card into the playoffs from the Eastern Conference. They'd have to lose a lot down the stretch to miss out, so if we assume they get in, it begs the question about Barzal, who has missed 17 games with a lower-body injury. There's been very little in the way of an update on him; all coach Lane Lambert would say Saturday is Barzal has not yet resumed skating. They've done well without Barzal, going 11-4-2 in those 17 games, but getting him back in the lineup will be key to pulling off a first-round upset, provided they get there, of course.  -- Rosen  14. Seattle Kraken (41-25-8)  Total points: 43  Last week: No. 13   The biggest question here is will the Kraken finish the job and clinch a playoff berth? They are five points clear of the Jets and seven ahead of the Calgary Flames for a postseason spot and have a seemingly favorable schedule, with five of their remaining eight games against teams already eliminated from contention. Though five of the Kraken's final eight are at home, they have actually played much better on the road, going 24-10-4, and are 17-15-4 at Climate Pledge Arena. The longer it takes them to clinch, the more pressure there will be. They should get in, but will have to earn it.  -- Bill Price, Editor-in-Chief  15. Winnipeg Jets (41-31-3)  Total points: 18  Last week: No. 15   The Jets, who looked like a surefire bet for a playoff berth in the wide-open Western Conference just a few weeks ago, are now clinging to the second wild card. With seven games left, the most obvious question is will they even get in? With their offense hitting a brick wall, it's not looking promising at the moment. They're 3-5-0 in their past eight games, outscored 23-12 and getting shut out three times. An upcoming five-game homestand, which will include visits from each direct competitor, Calgary and the Nashville Predators, can help, but the Jets will have to bring back a much better version of themselves than we've seen the past couple of months.  -- Paul Strizhevsky, staff writer  16. Pittsburgh Penguins (37-28-10)  Total points: 12  Last week: Unranked   The Penguins have been inconsistent all season, but luckily the teams below them have been as well, which is why they are clinging to the second wild card from the East. Their biggest question has been and continues to be: Who will step up from the bottom six? Jeff Carter has scored 12 goals. Mikael Granlund has one goal in 14 games since he was acquired from the Predators on March 1. We know the top forward group, including Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and Jason Zucker, can always be counted on, but it's the others who Pittsburgh needs more from.  -- David Satriano, staff writer  Others receiving points: Nashville Predators 6, Calgary Flames 4, Vancouver Canucks 1  Dropped out: None  Video: Predators stay in the Wild Card hunt  HERE'S HOW WE RANKED 'EM  AMALIE BENJAMIN  1.

The contract, which has an average annual value of $4.4375 million, will run through the 2026-27 season.   It means a lot. I'll be honest,  Chytil said Thursday.  I didn't think about it too much this season; I was just focusing on my game and it just came yesterday and I'm very happy that it's done.   The 23-year-old forward has NHL career highs in goals (22), assists (20) and points (42) in 67 games. He could have become a restricted free agent after this season.  His previous NHL high in goals was 14 in 2019-20. He had eight goals in each of the previous two seasons.  Selected by the Rangers in the first round (No. 21) of the 2017 NHL Draft, he made his NHL debut on Oct. 5, 2017.   I felt I was making progress since the first year. I know the production wasn't there that much the first years, but this year, finally, it's coming along with my game and that's what I'm saying all the time,  Chytil said.  It's about process and about the hard work that I'm putting in and happy that I can see that hard work pays off. It's not finished; it just started for me and just keep doing the things that I'm doing.   Chytil has 135 points (64 goals, 71 assists) in 320 regular-season games, and nine points (seven goals, two assists) in 23 Stanley Cup Playoff games.   He's had an outstanding year and the two years that I've been here, he's gotten better every game so we're really happy with him,  coach Gerard Gallant said,  and he's having a great year and again, it's a well-deserved contract.   He's more competitive, winning puck battles, being more aggressive, but that's where it started with him and when he gets that confidence doing that stuff, then he carries pucks through the neutral zone, he's strong in front of the net, so his game is going. He's matured, he's getting a little older, and it takes some of those kids sometimes [a couple hundred games] to get to the where they're going to be, and 'Fil' has really taken off.   New York (44-21-10) is third in the Metropolitan Division, four points behind the New Jersey Devils and five points behind the Carolina Hurricanes. The Rangers lost 2-1 at the Devils on Thursday.  NHL.com staff writer Mike G. Morreale contributed to this report"}, {"source": "nhl-news", "title": "Devils, Rangers have Hudson River rivalry thriving", "text": "The intensity, gamesmanship, and passionate chanting from the fans will be on full display when the New York Rangers visit the New Jersey Devils in the final regular-season meeting between the teams at Prudential Center on Thursday (7 p.m. ET; MSGSN, MSG, ESPN+, SN NOW).   Trust me, Rangers fans are not afraid to remind you of their wins against us,  Hockey Hall of Famer Martin Brodeur said.  But it's all good. I think this is what you play hockey for. At the end of the day, if you're involved in your community, you know how split this community is as far as hockey because the Rangers have been here for so long, and so it's been so great to see the diehard Devils fan because they care so much about our rivalry. They're so excited.   The winner will gain the upper hand for home-ice advantage in a possible Eastern Conference First Round best-of-7 series in the Stanley Cup Playoffs next month. The Devils are in second place in the Metropolitan Division, three points behind the Carolina Hurricanes. The Rangers are two points behind the Devils.   Home ice is definitely on the line here with this game,  New Jersey forward Miles Wood said.  The rivalry goes way back, so it's nice that both teams are very competitive this year, and we're both fighting for the same goal. I expect it to be a high tempo game.   Brodeur, who played a huge role in the Devils' success as their goalie on three Stanley Cup winning teams (1995, 2000, 2003), now serves as executive vice president of hockey operations. He also has the most wins all time among Devils goalies against the Rangers (49-32-15, five ties).  New York has won four of the six postseason series between the teams, although New Jersey won the most recent, a six-game series in the 2012 Eastern Conference Final.   Everybody's excited, our fan base is super excited about what we're putting on the ice so it's the start of a good thing,  Brodeur said.  Regardless if we're successful or not (on Thursday), it's a hockey game, so you never know what's going to happen.   The Devils, who are 2-0-1 against the Rangers this season, are looking to win a season series against their rivals for the first time since 2017-18 (3-1-0). New York is 130-98-11 with 27 ties in the all-time series and has won 10 of the past 13 games dating to March 4, 2021.  The Rangers (44-20-10) have won three in a row and are 9-1-1 since March 9.   Madison Square Garden is an amazing place to play,  Rangers forward Patrick Kane said after a 6-2 win against the Columbus Blue Jackets on Tuesday.  I think it's a big advantage to have home ice. We have that in front of us now if we do what we need to do.   New Jersey (46-20-8) has slipped a bit, going 2-4-2 in its past eight, while being outscored 28-22 over that span.   I've heard so much about this rivalry but obviously have never been part of it ... these type games are fun,  said Devils forward Timo Meier, who was acquired in a trade with the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 26.  These are the ones you circle on the calendar. These are the ones that are easy to get up for. I'm excited. I think the Rangers have been red-hot lately, and they got some good offensive guys so it's going to be a fun challenge. Obviously, for fans and for the players, these are the games you want to show up for.   Devils coach Lindy Ruff also realizes a possible postseason match against the Rangers looms.   I think that is the reality, that we could face them, so when you're looking at it, I think they're going to look at it the same as us ... they're going to get a good feel for how we're playing and we'll get a good feel for them,  Ruff said.  They've had some changes in their lineup and we've had some changes. It'll be a fun game to be involved in.   New York has yet to face New Jersey since Meier's arrival. Similarly, the Devils haven't played the Rangers since their trade for forwards Vladimir Tarasenko (from the St. Louis Blues on Feb. 9) and Kane (from the Chicago Blackhawks on Feb. 28).   We've never seen Tarasenko and Kane on that team, but they haven't seen Timo so it's going to be interesting,  Brodeur said.  I'm looking forward to see how we'll respond. I feel like these guys ... they're young. They know the window is just beginning to open; maybe a bit quicker than anybody thought but you still don't want to lose that edge. "}, {"source": "nhl-news", "title": "Toews could be facing 'last few weeks here' with Blackhawks", "text": "CHICAGO -- Jonathan Toews returned to practice with the Chicago Blackhawks on Tuesday for the first time in two months, hoping to come back and play before the end of what could be his final season with the only team he has played for in his 15 NHL seasons.   It's definitely special for me,  said the 34-year-old center, who has not played since Jan. 28 and announced on Feb. 21 he was stepping away from the Blackhawks to deal with effects of long COVID-19 and Chronic Immune Response Syndrome, which kept him out the entire 2020-21 season.  Regardless of what happens in the future this summer, it's definitely on my mind that this could be my last few weeks here in Chicago as a Blackhawk, and so that's definitely very important for me to just go out there and enjoy the game and just kind of soak it in and just really appreciate everything I've been able to be a part of here in Chicago and show my appreciation to the fans as well.   Toews helped the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup three times as their captain (2010, 2013, 2015), but Chicago is 24-44-6 this season and has been eliminated from playoff contention. After a 4-1 loss to the Dallas Stars at home Tuesday, the Blackhawks, last in the Western Conference, have eight games remaining.  Chicago has been aggressive in remaking its team this season, highlighted by the trade of franchise forward Patrick Kane to the New York Rangers in a three-team trade that also included the Arizona Coyotes on Feb. 28. Toews and Kane had been teammates since each entered the NHL with the Blackhawks in 2007-08 and played their 1,000th NHL game together in a 7-1 loss to the Rangers on Dec. 18. Toews is in the final season of an eight-year contract he signed on July 9, 2014.   I would say, for myself, personally, probably, I was definitely shocked,  Toews said in his first public comments since Kane was traded.  The possibility was there for a while, but, yeah, 'It's not actually going to happen,' you know? You just can't see a guy like him in another jersey. I heard he was flying home from San Jose to kind of wait things out until the trade was actually going through. I think it might have been Tuesday night or something. And then, I realized this is for real.   All of a sudden, you see him in a New York Rangers jersey. It kind of looks good on him, to be honest with you. I hate to say that. Just happy to see him enjoy himself playing with some really good players and being reunited with a guy like 'Breadman' (forward Artemi Panarin). 'Kaner' is such a competitor that it's going to feel good for him to go out there and play some meaningful games in the playoffs and play on the big stage.  Video: CHI@EDM: Toews redirects the puck in tight for a PPG   So it's been tough though to watch the changes that our team has gone through. The guys that have been a part of this room these last few years, namely a guy like Kaner, who I've played with my whole career and come back in the locker room right now, and it feels a lot different.   Despite Toews being limited to 46 games this season with 28 points (14 goals, 14 assists), he said he was looking forward to trying to return for a few more spins on the ice with Chicago this season.   Yeah, it's nice,  he said.  It's something you take for granted. You definitely realize when you're out of the routine and away from the locker room, not going on the road with the boys, all that stuff, and you're just kind of on your own slugging through every day, so that part of it's not easy. So it's definitely nice to be back and be on the ice with the guys.   Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson said Toews being around again is a boost.   Didn't talk to him after [skate] but it was great to have him in there, just his presence in the room for the meetings and on the ice,  he said.  Just talking to him about helping 'AA' (forward Andreas Athanasiou) with some face-off tips and stuff like that. It's great to have the leader back in there and hopefully this progresses to the next stage.   Named Blackhawks captain as a 20-year-old on July 18, 2008, Toews won the Conn Smythe Trophy voted as MVP of the playoffs in 2010, the Selke Trophy as the League's best defensive forward in 2012-13 and the Mark Messier NHL Leadership Award in 2014-15. The No. 3 pick in the 2006 NHL Draft, Toews ranks sixth in Blackhawks history with 880 points (371 goals, 509 assists) in 1,060 regular-season games, and fifth with 119 points (45 goals, 74 assists) in 137 playoff games.  Toews, who also skated on his own over the weekend, couldn't pinpoint when he'd be back in the lineup but hopes to be ready in a few more days.   Regardless, I wouldn't say to expect much,  Toews said with a grin.  But I'm just going to try and go out there and play with energy and have some fun, so we'll see when that might be.   Toews last played in 7-3 loss at the Edmonton Oilers on Jan. 28. Around that time, he said his health really took a turn for the worse.   I don't know if it was when we were on the road a lot or leading up to the [All-Star] break,  he said,  and it just got to the point where I couldn't move on the ice and didn't even want to put on my skates or roll out of bed to come to the rink.   So, it was pretty rough there for a bit. And so, I think it probably took me a couple of weeks of just wrestling with, in my own mind, trying to figure out what the right decision was, if I should keep trying to push through it, which really didn't feel like an option anymore, or kind of pulling the plug in and trying to focus my energy on getting better.   Toews said he keeps learning how to treat his long COVID and looks to others who have gone through the same, including Vancouver Canucks forward Brandon Sutter, who missed all of last season and this one with it.   I know even Brandon Sutter was approached and talked to the media recently,  Toews said,  and him and I have been in contact here and there, and even having someone like him to reach out to and we've dealt with a lot of the same similar symptoms over the last couple years. So I think it's helpful to hear from him, and I think for my situation, it's just trying to calm the symptoms and not put too much stress on my body, so I think these last few months have been good for that.

Campbell's removal was followed by a swift election process for a new mayor after the council Speaker, Nthabiseng Tshivhenga, an EFF councillor, declared a vacancy.  AIC councillor Sivuyile Ngodwana and Campbell were nominated for the position as Ekurhuleni mayor.  Campbell and Ngodwana contested for the position as voting got under way in Ekurhuleni on Thursday evening.  READ | Arrogance and dictatorship: Why EFF, ANC marriage failed in Ekurhuleni  The Independent Electoral Commission of SA was expected to preside over the election of the new mayor.  Campbell's removal was made easy because the DA coalition governed the metro with a minority.  The DA governed with the support of the IFP, Freedom Front Plus and the ACDP.  The council dynamics had long challenged the DA coalition's metro governance and contributed to a souring relationship with its former partner in the city, ActionSA.  Newsletter Weekly The Political Insider News24's expert team takes you into the inner workings of politics in South Africa as we gear up for the 2024 national elections and beyond.  ActionSA councillors voted to keep Campbell in office to fend off the EFF and the ANC, but the party was not in a coalition with the DA in Ekurhuleni.    A partnership between the ANC and the EFF in Ekurhuleni means a majority for the two parties, while smaller political parties will likely aid in the council.  The ANC and EFF made a similar move in Johannesburg, though it failed in Tshwane, and used minority party councillors as mayors.  At the same time, they divided up mayoral committee roles in the Johannesburg municipalities among themselves.

The industry association said the implications for South Africa's future are significant.  Industry must coalesce and support government's reform plans and agenda.  For more financial news, go to the News24 Business front page  The African Rail Industry Association (ARIA) has highlighted the urgent need for action as South Africa's railways face terminal decline.    ARIA chairperson, James Holley, said Transnet is anticipated to have moved between 155 and 160 million tonnes in the financial year ending 31 March 2023 - representing a more than 30% decline from the 226 million tonnes moved in 2018.   The implications for the country's future are significant, and we seem to be approaching a critical inflection point with regards to our railways,  Holley said during a web event on Thursday.   If we don't change direction quickly, the ramifications for our industry are very concerning, but perhaps more so are the consequences for the upstream economy.   Jan Havenga, an independent researcher and a professor at Stellenbosch University, said the loss to GDP of general freight was about 2%.  It  has been slowly creeping up on us, and it's getting more every year every year , he said, adding:  That is just a cancer that we cannot afford as a country anymore.  Holley said the only solution ARIA can see for rail recovery is to coalesce and support the government's reform plans and agenda.   We have a gazetted rail policy.... We took 14 years to develop a progressive policy that can ignite the South African economy. Now is the time to implement the policy and no longer to debate it,  he said.  Havenga said Transnet's rail network is too large and requires restructuring. This may include ring-fencing and corporatising certain low-density and export corridors while maintaining a core network.   We can have a vertically integrated or separated railway; we definitely need a horizontal separation between low and high-density lines,  he said.  Track infrastructure investment is potentially the most difficult problem to solve in the rail industry today, and ARIA estimates that more than R100 billion needs to be spent to restore track integrity.  But ARIA believes Transnet's ability to raise further capital will be constrained, while the realities of South Africa's fiscal position suggest that National Treasury will unlikely provide the level of grant funding required to restore railway infrastructure.   This leaves one source of funding remaining, which is the private sector,  said Holley.  The good news, great news, is that the appetite to do so most certainly exists. The appetite is there because the underlying freight volumes are there.   What is needed urgently now is the framework to guide implementation, Holley said.  The vertical separation of railways into the roles of infrastructure owner, infrastructure managers and train operating companies, together with the Private Sector Participation Framework are critical for this success.   Newsletter For Subscriber Weekly Business Briefing A deep dive into the big business story of the week, as well as expert analysis of markets and trends.  Implementing third-party access is also critical, said Holley.   ARIA fully supports the implementation of the Regulation of Transport Bill, the Rail Masterplan, and the Rail Transportation Bill. However, ARIA does not support the notion that third party access should wait for these to be implemented ... we do not believe the rail industry, nor the economy, can afford to wait any longer.   Havenga said private sector involvement should be mandated.  Transnet has a raw deal at the moment. They inherited a very difficult situation. But what I don't see them doing is taking on board all the assistance and advice that people are willing to give them freely,  he said.  I want them to work with the private sector immediately just to get some of the bottlenecks out of the way and to make vertical separation real.   While the latest statistics are not accessible, passenger rail volumes are also dire and estimated to be more than 80% lower than in the late 2000s.  The primary reform for passenger rail is the devolution of the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) into the metros - the appetite for which Aria says is encouraging.   While we cannot fool ourselves that there is a long road ahead of us, the fact that Prasa is on track to spend its Capex budget for the first time since 2016 needs to be recognised, and just might represent the first real signs of progress in passenger rail that we have seen for some time,  Holley added."}, {"source": "news24", "title": "Ex-ActionSA Gauteng chairperson Bongani Baloyi launches new party", "text": "Former ActionSA Gauteng chairperson Bongani Baloyi has launched a political party named Xiluva.

The acceleration is similar to a bullet leaving a gun and even faster than mantis shrimp  Bigclaw snapping shrimp can clamp their claws very quickly Gerald Robert Fischer/Shutterstock.  Juvenile snapping shrimp have broken the acceleration record for a repeatable body movement underwater. The tiny crustaceans can snap their claws with an acceleration of nearly 600,000 metres per second squared - similar to that of a bullet leaving the barrel of a gun.  The record cleanly beats adult snapping shrimp, and even other famously zippy underwater species such as mantis shrimp, which use their ultra-fast claws to punch enemies or bash up prey.  Bigclaw snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis), which grow to several centimetres long, have spring-like mechanisms on the larger of their two claws. When this mechanism is released, it whips the claw closed, creating a high-speed water jet and a loud popping sound that startles potential predators. Previous studies have found that adult shrimp reach claw-snapping accelerations of around 30,000 m/s2.  Advertisement  Jacob Harrison and Sheila Patek at Duke University in North Carolina wanted to see how juveniles, which are only a few millimetres long, compared. They raised some in the lab, and then used a camera attached to a microscope to take videos of 1- and 2-month-olds snapping their claws.  When they tried filming at 50,000 frames per second - the frame rate they would use for adult shrimp - the claw's movement was still just a blur, says Harrison.  It was like, 'Wow, these guys are really cooking.'  It wasn't until the researchers upped the camera speed to 300,000 frames per second that they could measure just how fast the animals were moving their limbs.  Harrison and Patek  It turned out that young shrimp were accelerating their claws at 580,000 m/s2. That is around 20 times faster than their parents.  These are insanely high accelerations,  says Harrison.  The whole snap takes just 300 microseconds - a blink of an eye lasts around 500 times that. Very few creatures can beat this kind of speediness. One exception is the Dracula ant, which can shut its jaws in just 23 microseconds. But it is easier to move quickly in air than it is in water, meaning shrimp have to work harder to reach the same speeds.  There is technically one animal that can pack a higher acceleration in the underwater world, although it breaks its spring mechanism in the process. Jellyfish shoot little harpoons into objects that brush their surfaces, and these barbs can reach accelerations nearly a hundred times higher than that of the shrimp's claw. But each harpoon is a one-off, as it remains stuck in the victim after being shot.  The comparisons make the shrimp's achievement that much more impressive, says Harrison, adding that the crustacean's ultra-fast limbs may help researchers design jumping robots and other devices relying on spring mechanisms.  These snapping shrimp have these crazy high accelerations,  he says,  but they can do it in water, and they're doing it repeatedly.

In 2007, researchers at ZSL proposed that species should be prioritised based on how unique they are, as well as how threatened they are. They developed a method called EDGE, which stands for evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered.  The idea is that it is more important to save different branches on the tree of life than different twigs on the same branch. We lose more when species with no close relatives go extinct than we do when species with lots of close relatives go extinct.  Advertisement   It's been quite successful,  says Rikki Gumbs at ZSL. For instance, in 2018, the EDGE list of reptiles highlighted the uniqueness of Australia's turtles, such as the Mary River turtle (Elusor macrurus), which diverged from other living species 40 million years ago. This has led to more being done to protect them, he says.  But some issues with EDGE have arisen. For instance, we know so little about some species that biologists often have to make guesses when trying to calculate an EDGE score, says Gumbs. And if a species has close relatives that are highly endangered, it should be prioritised over other species whose close relatives aren't endangered, he says.  The mountain pygmy possum, ranked as the top priority for mammal conservation Jason Edwards/NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY/Getty Images  So Gumbs and his colleagues have developed an improved version of EDGE that better takes account of uncertainties and factors such as how endangered relatives are, and have applied initially it to mammals.  The improved system doesn't make much difference to the top 100 - it still includes 97 of the same species, though in a different order. On the 2007 EDGE list of mammals, the mountain pygmy possum (Burramys parvus), the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) and Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) were ranked 28, 16 and 54 respectively, and these revised rankings are due partly to changes in our knowledge rather than the modified technique.  But the new method does make a big difference further down the rankings.  Forty per cent of species that would previously be recognised as EDGE are not now,  says Gumbs.  The baiji or Yangtze river dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) topped the first EDGE list. It is now thought to be extinct.

The company has said the new satellites  represent a step forward in Starlink capability .  The newer satellites will orbit Earth at an altitude below 600 kilometres, meaning they will eventually decay and re-enter the planet's atmosphere, limiting the number left circling Earth as debris. Astronomers have previously raised concerns that large constellations of satellites will affect the ability to see stars in our night sky.  The lower orbit also has benefits over geostationary satellites, which have been the main provider of satellite internet connections until now, says Doug Madory of Kentik, a company that monitors internet performance. Geostationary satellites orbit Earth at higher altitudes - around 35,800 kilometres - which increases latency, or the time taken to send and receive information on the internet. Low-orbit satellites like Starlink's give lower latency by using more satellites, closer to the surface, says Madory.

These insects feed on small amounts of nutrients in large volumes of water, forcing them to eliminate up to 300 times their body weight in liquid waste each day. By twisting parts of their anus to release and then spring-load a drop of urine, they can propel their waste at a fraction of the energy cost of producing a stream, says Saad Bhamla at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.  Sharpshooters, which are a kind of leafhopper and are only a few millimetres in length, feed on the sap in plants' xylem tubes, which run from the roots to the leaves. Composed of 95 per cent water and 5 per cent minerals and other nutrients, xylem sap is difficult for the insects to pump out since it gets naturally sucked inwards inside the plant. This means the insects are already working hard for very little return in energy-providing nutrients, says Bhamla.  Advertisement  He and his colleagues wondered how the tiny insects could afford to spend the additional energy needed to urinate as much as they do - a habit that has earned them their common name.  A sharpshooter insect with a droplet of urine on its anal stylus Bhamla Lab, Georgia Tech   If you were only drinking diet lemonade, and that was your entire diet, then you really wouldn't want to waste energy in any part of your biological process,  he says.  That's sort of how it is for this tiny organism.   To understand their secret, the team analysed 22 waste ejections from five glassy-winged sharpshooters (Homalodisca vitripennis). In particular, they observed the movement of a pointy, hairy appendage called the anal stylus as it rotated and opened to squeeze out a droplet. Each droplet grew for about 80 milliseconds, then the stylus rotated slightly more to create a spring-load.  At that point, the stylus made a fast twist, catapulting the droplet into the air. Remarkably, the droplets moved 40 per cent faster than the squeezing stylus did when it propelled them, says Bhamla.  This mechanical phenomenon - in which drops move up and out faster than the speed at which the rotating surface that ejects them moves - is known as  superpropulsion . It is rare in engineering designs and has never been detected in a living organism before, says Bhamla.  Through physical and mathematical modelling, the team determined that the sharpshooter stylus transfers energy to waste droplets with great efficiency. The success of the system depends entirely on timing, says Bhamla, just like a high diver jumping from a diving board.  Because the droplets are soft and deformable, they can store energy, which then fuels their speed while they are propelled through the air. As a result, sharpshooters use an estimated four to eight times less energy to eliminate waste than they would if they were creating jet streams - which require significant energy to create expulsion speed.  Our models all suggest it's one of the most energy-efficient routes to flick droplets away,  says Bhamla.  Larger animals and humans don't need such an energy-efficient urination system because, compared with their energy intake, muscular strength and urinary output, the cost of producing streams is negligible.  But making jets when you're as small [as a sharpshooter] is very hard,  says Bhamla.  The findings could inspire engineering designs for energy-efficient self-cleaning systems for smart wearable electronics, defogging systems for goggles and eyeglasses or transport systems in soft robotics, he says.

TRANSCRIPT  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC STORYTELLING FELLOW TARA ROBERTS  DEBRA ADAMS SIMMONS (HOST): I'm Debra Adams Simmons, executive editor for history and culture at National Geographic. You're listening to In Conversation: a special episode exploring Black history and culture.  AMY BRIGGS (HOST): Hey, Debra. Welcome to Overheard.  ADAMS SIMMONS: Thanks, Amy. It's fun to be here with you, crashing the podcast. I'm excited to share some of the great interviews that you, Peter, and the team have done during the past year.  BRIGGS: Yeah, I'm so glad that you've taken the time to be here, so thank you for that. So who are we highlighting as part of this special episode?  ADAMS SIMMONS: Well, we went back in your archives, and actually in most cases into your raw tape, and pulled out interviews that you had with explorer Tara Roberts, computer scientist Gloria Washington, and photographer Ruddy Roye--so today we'll be hearing from all three of them.  Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.  Through their dynamic work across maritime archeology, artificial intelligence, and photojournalism, they're determined to reframe Black history and culture.  BRIGGS: I was in awe of Tara. It was amazing to hear about the path that she's taken through life, and the amazing journey she had, you know, finding Diving with a Purpose, and her mission to reframe the story of Africans in the Americas.  ADAMS SIMMONS: Great. So let's begin with National Geographic Storytelling Fellow Tara Roberts and her conversation with you, Amy, from this past fall. Tara is documenting the efforts of Black scuba divers and archaeologists to find the lost wrecks of ships that carried enslaved people from Africa to the Americas. This is really critical work, and we are excited to hear what she has to say.  More after this.  TARA ROBERTS (STORYTELLING FELLOW): I was talking to my mom before this call, and my mother's a huge, like--she's so concerned with the history of our family, and she's the one in the family who's, you know, doing the family tree and trying to trace our roots back. And my family is able to trace back to my great--it's my great-great-grandfather, so my grandfather's grandparents. But that's as far back as we can go.  And we do have pictures of them, which is great, and I actually remember seeing my great-grandfather's name and my great-grandmother's name listed on a ledger for a plantation in North Carolina. I was using ancestry.com, and my cousin had done some research and we saw my great-great-grandfather and grandmother's names and that's just like, oh, that hit you in so many places, but that's as far as we can go back.  I know nothing else. So, looking at this history past these shores, it opens up something for me. It gives me access into a part of my past that I didn't have before. And that's exciting to me. Like slavery is not the start of our story. But according to the history books, it is. That's where everything starts, and there is this misunderstanding of Africa. I don't even know what's actually meant by the word  Africa.  Like it's this huge place with 52--or don't quote me on that--is it 52 or 54 countries? It's a lot of countries with really distinct and different traditions and legacies and cultures, but it all gets mashed together into this one thing. I think that this--this access that the shipwrecks give us opens up an opportunity to distinguish, to deepen, to further understand who I am and where I come from--and to do that outside of a frame that I've been given as a Black American in this country.  BRIGGS: So how has your work recreated that frame for you? Where would you put the beginning?  ROBERTS: Well, not there.  BRIGGS: I think that's clear.  ROBERTS: I mean, I think it's opened up far more questions. So I'll say this, I also did ancestry.com for my, to see where my DNA is traced from, and quite a bit of it is traced from West Africa.  But when you look at where the migratory patterns are, it's like some of my ancestry comes from the Bantu people who were throughout southern Africa as well. So when I go to Mozambique, like is it possible that maybe some of my ancestry is there as well? I don't know. But maybe. So I feel like I have way more questions and more places to look, more places to think, and that feels really exciting to me.  So I don't have an answer yet about, like, completely what specifically has shifted for me or how I see things differently, but I just--it feels like there's an expanse now that wasn't there before, like it was a wall and it was a closed door and it was a sad wall that you just didn't want to be a part of, you didn't want to touch it. But now there's like an open expanse and there's like there's sadness in the expanse and there's some pain, but there's a lot more.  BRIGGS: It's almost like in your particular instance, you know, that wall started at that ledger and North Carolina, you know, that's where it stopped. And then you have--in my mind, I'm just seeing, like, the wrecks almost coming out of the water and, like, flooding that wall away, you know?  ROBERTS: Oh, I love that. That's a beautiful image. I love that.  BRIGGS: Because that's washing away all of that inability to access that--you know, they felt unknowable. But like you can get more of your, you know, get more of your feet wet in the story. I'm not going to stay in the water metaphor anymore, but I'm sorry--I'm crying a little bit. This is just so moving.  So what do you think needs to happen for more of these, you know, of the wrecks to be found and identified?  ROBERTS: Yeah, it's a great question. Yeah, I mean, I guess there's an obvious answer--more divers or more funding, more opportunities to participate in the work-- but I actually think I'll back up from that and I'll say I think really what's necessary and then all kinds of things lead from that. But I think what's necessary is recognition that this history matters. More people understanding that there is a bigger narrative to be told, that this work is important, and that it matters for a huge part of the U.S. population. And also that this story is not just a Black people story, like this is part of all of our history--and that there is not a focused effort to to like discover it is insane.  I was thinking the other day about how many stories and how much work was done or devoted to documenting the Titanic--like there's so many stories about the Titanic. And there are stories from cultures all around the world, like it's a story that has captured people's imaginations, and it's a great story, like it's a tragic story, it's a moving story. Like that story was important. So how does this story get that kind of weight, where then resources are dedicated to it? You know, again, it could be like 650,000 people whose lives were lost.  There's this really interesting moment in time right now where things that have been hidden in the shadows are coming out, like people are seeing things that they hadn't seen before. And there's an openness to engage with these things, and I think that there's an openness to engage with history in a way that has not been possible before. So what do I think needs to happen to move this work forward is more of that: more people realizing that this is so important. And when that happens, like all the levers change; then there are all sorts of creative ways to approach this, and more technology can be used to find wrecks. More work can be done to track down where the ships are, where they might be, and what their histories are. More divers can get trained. Like then a lot can happen, but there has to be a will to find this history, and a will to tell the story differently. So that's what we need to move forward.  ADAMS SIMMONS: That's National Geographic Storytelling Fellow Tara Roberts speaking with Overheard's Amy Briggs.  BRIGGS: It was such an incredible conversation, and I'm so excited that we got to feature more of it than we did in her episode.  SHOW NOTES  ADAMS SIMMONS: And Tara will be posting updates about her travels on Instagram and Facebook. You can find those @storiesfromthedepths.  You can also find out more about Diving With a Purpose by listening to our Overheard podcast episode  The Search for History's Lost Slave Ships.   COMPUTER SCIENTIST GLORIA WASHINGTON  BRIGGS: So Debra, who do we have next?  ADAMS SIMMONS: Next, we bring you a conversation between computer scientist Gloria Washington and Brian Gutierrez, guest host of Overheard.  Gloria Washington runs the Affective Biometrics Labs at Howard University in Washington, D.C. She's an expert on emotional artificial intelligence.  BRIGGS: I'm going to have to take notes on this part, because I'm not--I don't even know anything about natural emotional intelligence.  ADAMS SIMMONS: Well, let's listen.  BRIAN GUTIERREZ (HOST): So, Gloria, the first thing we usually start with is a quick introduction. You know, could you please introduce yourself? Who are you and what do you do?  GLORIA WASHINGTON (COMPUTER SCIENTIST): Yeah. So I'm Gloria Washington, and I run the Affective Biometrics Lab at Howard University.  GUTIERREZ: And that's affective with an  A.   WASHINGTON: Yes, it means emotional. In my lab, we look at facial expressions, we look at ears, we look at physiological information, like heart rate, heart rate variability--that tells us all kinds of information about a person's emotional state. And we can make inferences and conclusions if this information is fed into AI to tell us if a person is frustrated, happy, sad, neutral, disgusted. But it helps us tune, and actually create software systems that think more smartly about the human.  GUTIERREZ: What does it mean for artificial intelligence to be emotional? Like those are not two adjectives I would put together in normal speech. What does that mean?  WASHINGTON: Yeah, so when you get into making any type of software, we often forget that the software is supposed to serve the human and not the other way around.  And sometimes that can lead to frustration. It can lead to, you know, whole groups of people having a horrible disposition about using technology. And so my area is interested in understanding: How do we make these interactions with computers more positive? How do we make them more happy? And how do we use the emotional information that you can gather from a human to actually make our software applications better?  GUTIERREZ: I wonder if we could zoom out for a minute and ask some like general AI questions.  WASHINGTON: Yes.  GUTIERREZ: You know, artificial intelligence kind of means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. How do you define artificial intelligence? What makes that computer intelligent?  WASHINGTON: Well, so I think my definition is probably a little bit different from the traditional computer scientist. So I think of artificial intelligence as a helper.  It's a helper application that allows me to triage and present information in a unique and easily digestible way so that I can do my job better, whatever that job is. Some traditional computer scientists would go almost to a micro level where they talk about the actual deep-learning algorithms, where you get down to the connections in their neural network. But me, I like to keep it higher level, because I truly think it is. When we think of artificial intelligence, we think that the machine should be a helper to us, not take over our job. It should only supplement, triage, recommend. And then we, the human, can act on in a more intelligent way to actually go about our day.  GUTIERREZ: So I was wondering if you could kind of like talk me through your day as a data scientist, and what are kind of like some of the sounds you might hear as you're doing your job?  WASHINGTON: As a data scientist at Howard, I work with a lot of undergraduate students, and they see things totally different from the way that I see things. So it's a lot of questions, and it's a lot of, well, Why is this technique producing this kind of data? I think it's flawed. And a lot of young people now care about issues that are important to them, like feminism, criminal justice, police justice, Black Lives Matter, stuff like that. And they want to work on those kind of problems. So the questions that they would have is, well, Why aren't I seeing any kind of technologies that are catered towards me and why aren't, you know, these kind of things important? So I'm fielding a lot of questions like that from my undergraduate research students.  I have about 15 that I work with, and at least my philosophy is, if they're interested in learning more, why not expose them as early as possible to it, even if they don't know all of the intricacies behind the scenes. But they're learning. And so when they're learning, they're asking me those kind of questions--of why did it even take, you know, for George Floyd for people to start to care or, you know, and then that feeds into technology.  I would ask them a question. Well, you're a computer scientist, what would you do? What technology would you build or what company would you start to be able to address that problem in your community?  GUTIERREZ: You seem like a really like fight-fire-with-fire kind of woman. Like, we have these issues with AI technology, we're going to build our own AI to counteract it in these ways.  WASHINGTON: Well, I think it's important--and I recognize this now when I see how dependent I am on certain things and I'm like--if we think about how many barbershops there are, why can we have 50 million barbershops, but one AI technique, built by one company? No! there should be 50 million AI techniques, and the piece of the pie is large, and we can contribute to that. So I want students to know that you can get a piece of that pie yourself, and do not be afraid to get it.  GUTIERREZ: Why is diversity in AI important?  WASHINGTON: Diversity in AI is important because I think sometimes we are trapped in our own heads and trapped in the problems that are important to us as humans. And we may not recognize a problem from a different perspective. So having diverse people at the table or who are actually coding the algorithms behind the scenes will expose the flaws that may come up with the algorithm.  GUTIERREZ: How do you know if a data set is diverse? You know, my impression is that there's like millions and millions of images. You know, maybe I could look at maybe a hundred images in a day. But how do you know if there's an issue?  WASHINGTON: Well, for me--I did a post-doc in this, and I had no choice but to look at these databases of millions of images, where my entire day was looking through these databases to determine how diverse they were. But what I had to do was search through these databases.  How many--and they usually tell you how many men, how many women, how many Black people, white people. But then it kind of ends there. It doesn't even talk about ethnicity, like within the individuals. Because when you think about it, a lot of the college students fill out a form. And this form information--and it's just like, what's your age, what's your race, that kind of thing, gender. And so I had no choice but to look through most of these databases. And there are millions of images.  So there needs to be people behind the scenes that can actually say, hey, you know, let's retune our system or retrain our system to get a better model based off of this database because it has this many men or this many women, and it's more diverse than the average database that we would get just starting now.  GUTIERREZ: I think this is also a really cool opportunity to let people know about research that's being done by Black AI researchers. I wonder if you could tell me what are some of the recent innovations that have been happening in that space--what are some of the new ideas that are being designed by Black researchers that people should know about?  WASHINGTON: I would say Black AI specialists are starting to work in areas that are important to their communities. So there are apps now that will find you a barber shop, but it finds you a barber shop based off of your input, and it learns from you if you go to that actual barber shop. So we're starting to think of problems that are specific to our community, like I can't find this hair product or I can't find stuff for me, or I have diabetes and I have a specific health application that is only, you know, for African Americans--like there are products that are being developed for our specific community.  GUTIERREZ: Yeah, that makes sense, and I wonder how you sort of situate yourself in this history of African-American scientists working in the United States like the Hidden Figures? That was an awesome movie. I really enjoyed watching it. But I think they truly are hidden figures in the sense that I had no idea they existed before the movie came out. I was wondering if you could kind of, you know, put your work in the context of this history of female scientists--female African-American scientists--and what that history means to you.  WASHINGTON: When I sort of think of myself in the history of African-American computer scientists--even that are African American, not even female, when we think of it--so in the time of Hidden Figures, there were many women Black coders who were leading the thing. Whatever happened after the Black programmers or coders were phased out, diversity in computer science just plummeted.  I kind of fit in after them and kind of see myself as taking up the struggle of everything that they had at that moment that they probably couldn't voice.  Because if you even think about getting in the door of working at NASA, you probably have to be quiet about a lot. You couldn't express the particular kind of things that were most important to you. You did your job. You were a programmer. You're working behind the scene, working on these math problems. But the kind of issues that I'm focusing on are issues that I take exactly what they were doing with programming, working on mathematical issues, image processing issues, but I'm tailoring it for my community.  So I think of, like, using all the background and all of the information and struggle that they went through, but tailoring it. Now we're having the actual voice to be able to say, I want to work on the problems that are important to my community.  And when I think of from the perspective of being in emotional artificial intelligence, there are not a lot of Black women who are in this area so I'm also writing the background and all of the history in all of the problems and challenges and opportunities that she had in this emotional AI space and then tailoring it also for working on things that are important to the Black community, like hair products, Black Lives Matter. Also, another thing that I'm interested in getting into is microaggression research of how we think of of people who are microaggressed on a daily basis, of how microaggressions feed into our everyday life.  And if we have technology now that can tell us when we've accidentally offended individuals, maybe we can start to get better, and maybe we can learn in these diversity and inclusion training seminars what we have done wrong, like on a yearly basis kind of thing, and improve our speech. Like we do a lot of that now. And I put my foot in my mouth a lot. And I think of, hmm, why can't there be technology that helps me not put my foot in my mouth but makes me get better? So when I think of that kind of space of how I fit in, I'm working on novel things that are important to the Black and brown communities.  SHOW NOTES  ADAMS SIMMONS: Gloria Washington will be featured in an upcoming Overheard episode on the  Battle for the Soul of Artificial Intelligence.  You can follow her work on social media @DrGloWash.  BRIGGS: I will definitely be checking that out, not only because it's a fascinating topic but that upcoming episode is our producer Brian Gutierrez's first time hosting, so it's his official debut.  ADAMS SIMMONS: And finally, Amy, we bring you a conversation between National Geographic photographer and storytelling fellow Ruddy Roye and Peter Gwin, your cohost here at Overheard.  BRIGGS: So Debra, I hear you've worked with Ruddy before?  ADAMS SIMMONS: Ruddy Roye's first assignment for National Geographic was to photograph people donating artifacts to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C.  He also did a fantastic job photographing historically Black colleges in Atlanta, and this past summer his work on the protests was really outstanding.  Let's listen.  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC STORYTELLING FELLOW RUDDY ROYE  RUDDY ROYE (PHOTOGRAPHER): It was beautiful to me. It was beautiful to travel around the country, photographing Nat Turner's great-great-great-great-grandson and seeing a history that is not in our history books, is not told anywhere, photographing a sign that says Blackhead Signpost [Road], and knowing that this signpost was was erected to instill fear in any other people of African descent who was working in Virginia, for free, from having another insurrection. And that's why that sign was there. It said Blackhead Signpost--still in Virginia.  PETER GWIN (HOST): Wow.  ROYE: Every story that I've done for Geographic, every one--I follow that up with the race issue, which made me sit at Morehouse University and look at the next generation of our black leaders and see the pros and cons of of what it means to grow up in a country that does not feed you its history. I've learned, I've learned more from these than I think I've been able to like put into these pictures. These are actually the histories of the history that I've brought back to my to my sons, to the effect that when my son was given this assignment to write on a civil rights leader, he said to his teacher that he preferred to write about his father, because that's where he gets his history from.  GWIN: Wow, that's powerful.  ROYE: So these stories have been more than just stories for me, they have been pages in a history that has not been written yet, because it's not a part of our curriculum and it's not in our history books.  GWIN: So I know that you teach, or you have taught, at New York University. What's the first thing you tell a student who wants to be a photographer?  ROYE: Why do you want to photograph Black content? Why is that important to you? No, first I usually ask how many of you would like to photograph Black content? Usually the whole class. And I say...  GWIN: And this is like a mixed class of like all races?  ROYE: It's usually 80 percent, 90 percent white, of a class of 13 kids, two to four Black kids. So I usually go, why? Why? What makes you think that you're qualified? And they look at me like. And so I'd say, do you know who Emmett Till is? Do you know who Ida B. Wells is? Do you know what Jim Crow did?  And I would tell these stories because I wanted them to get to the place where--I was assigned to do a story covering the Gangster Disciples in Chicago and the Black Disciples in Chicago. And at the end of the assignment, Time magazine asks me, Why is it that when we send you to go do a story about gangsters, you didn't bring back gangsters?  And I would say because I didn't see any gangster.  I said I saw fathers, brothers, nephews, you know, sons, cousins.  But if the gangsters turn up, I would photograph them. But in that space, I see humans. And I said, the only way you can get to that space is if you understand the history that has dictated how these people live their lives. If you can understand that, you see the story differently.  I did a workshop with an editor in New York. And while I'm in there, some--a girl from Lithuania was asked why she wanted to be a part of the workshop, and she said, because I want to photograph the ghettos of Beds...the ghettos of Brownsville. And we go,  ghettos of Brownsville?  She say yes, I want to go to the ghettos of Brownsville. And the next day, so that was--and I lost it. But the next day she went to Brownsville, and all she came back with was crack vials and people who were smoking crack. And I never went back to the workshop. I couldn't. Because for me, it was not my job to tell her that what she's doing is the stereotypical story. And I did not see the editor doing it. So in Jamaica, we say: You don't go to a man's house and criticize him--you leave. That's what I did.  GWIN: One of the things about your photography that I'm so struck by is that you're especially known for your portraits. Your portraits have this gravity to them--it feels like I'm passing by a planet like Jupiter that has this really strong gravity and it pulls me into the picture. And how do you create that? What is it that you do to create a picture that pulls a reader in like that?  ROYE: If there's a thing because, you know, I also believe that--and this is gonna sound corny, but there's everything in life, whether it's, whichever--it's on the yin or the yang. There's a spiritual element to everything. It's how you use it. For instance, there's certain words I don't use. I don't use the word like, I'm going to photograph  my subject.  I don't use that word because I believe that it creates hierarchy.  I also when I'm going to do a story or I'm going to photograph a portrait, I like to find a space where I can connect even before I start taking pictures. And that connection is like--I don't know if you saw Avatar. Is it Avatar, the James Cameron film, where they would pull their hair and touch each other? And that's how they join. Your job, I think, is to find a way to join with that person, so that they can give you something that's deeper than the superficial. And my--the one way that I find that gets to that place is when they know that you understand. And whether it is giving them the story that you have been through this before, or you have seen it photographed it. You kind of have an idea of where we are. And never, never pretending to, like, to fully understand, but leaving space so that they fill in the gaps for you. And it is in that space--them filling the gaps--that the authenticity comes out.

The firm envisions the car driving itself back to the showroom - or to a scrapyard if the value of the car is low. But a security expert warns that the proposed system could instead be used to steal cars remotely.  The patent, which was filed in 2021 but granted only last week, describes how the system would kick in if the car owner failed to respond to messages informing them they were falling behind with payments. At that point, a series of measures would first be used to make the car unpleasant to drive, then impossible. Finally, as a last resort, the car would return itself to the showroom.  The system could begin by disabling features such as GPS navigation, the music system or the air conditioning, in order to create what the patent describes as a  certain level of discomfort  for the owner. If this doesn't work, the patents suggests enabling the car to create an  incessant and unpleasant sound , such as a chime or beep, every time the owner gets inside.  Advertisement  The next escalation would be to limit access to the car on certain days or at certain times, making it unusable for leisure at weekends, but allowing the owner to continue getting to work and therefore not harming their ability to eventually pay for the car. The patent also suggests using GPS to  geofence  certain areas in which the car would be unusable.  If all else fails, then the car could be instructed to drive itself to a location where a waiting tow-truck could pick it up, or even to drive itself all the way to a repossession storage area. If the mileage on the car is high and its condition is poor, then it could instead be instructed to drive itself straight to a scrapyard for recycling.  Such a system would, of course, require the car to be fully autonomous, which has been a persistent but elusive goal for car makers: it is no more possible to buy a truly self-driving car now than it was 15 years ago. Ford itself recently announced that it was giving up on its goal of developing full self-driving technology, at a cost of $2.7 billion.  Ford didn't respond to a request for comment on the newly granted patent, but security expert Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey, UK, says that there would be security risks with such a system.   It'll be a brave vehicle manufacturer that builds this into their vehicle as standard,  he says.  I can imagine a car thief not just finding an unauthorised way into the system, but also socially engineering 'authorised' users to give them access.

A fa dommen var bare helt utrolig.  Det sier en lettet Faustina Krogstad, etter a ha fatt dommen fra rettssaken mot Utlendingsnemnda (UNE).  - Vi vant.  Sostrene Gloria Elfa Adam Sarfo, Brenda Elfa Adam Sarfo og Faustina Krogstad sammen med datteren sin. Foto: Bent Lindsetmo / NRK  Mye usikkerhet  Faustina og sostrene har i den siste tiden levd i uvisshet om de far bli i Norge eller ikke.  Da NRK motte familien for rettssaken, hadde tobarnsmora pakket koffertene klare til seg selv og barna, i tilfelle det ikke skulle ga veien.  Na kan hun endelig pakke ut igjen.  En lettet Faustina kan pakke ut av alle koffertene hun hadde klar og har na lovlig opphold inntil saken er ferdig. Foto: Bent Lindsetmo / NRK  Kampen mot UNE har ifolge Faustina vaert tung og stressende.  - Det har gatt litt opp og ned, men vi har gatt og hapet. Det har vaert mye folelser pa en gang.  Selv om sostrene kan juble for medhold i retten er ikke saken helt ferdig enda.  Ikke avgjort enda  Advokatfullmektig Lise Stefanussen, som representerer sostrene, forklarer at UNE na har en maned pa seg til a anke saken.  - Dersom den ikke ankes sa vil tingretten sin dom bli rettskraftig. Det betyr at da gjelder den og vedtakene kjennes ugyldig. Og sa ma UNE foreta nye vurderinger og nye vedtak.  Men dersom dommen ankes, blir det en ny rettssak dersom lagmannsretten tar denne inn.  - Vi haper at man kan godta denne dommen nar den er sapass tydelig som den er. Og at man anerkjenner at det har vaert en belastende prosess for sostrene a ikke bli trodd over sa lang tid, sier Stefanussen.  Hun forklarer at retten er ganske tydelig ovenfor UNE om flere feilvurderinger som er gjort, og at far sine opplysninger har fatt for stor betydning.  Til NRK svarer UNE at de skal ga noye gjennom det som har kommet frem i tingretten.  - Vi skal na ga grundig gjennom dommen vi har fatt fra tingretten. Vi vil ta stilling til ankesporsmalet innen fristen.  Det sier enhetsleder i UNE Georg Magne Ronnevig.  Og inntil dette er avgjort, uavhengig av hvor lang tid det tar, har sostrene lovlig opphold i Norge.  Bakgrunn  Sostrene kom til Norge fra Ghana pa familiegjenforening med faren i 2016. Aret etter kom de i konflikt med faren og ble tatt hand om av barnevernet.  Da alle var over 18 ar fikk to av sostrene et vedtak om utkastelse fra Norge.  Det var 1. oktober 2022. Brenda og Gloria fikk da tre uker pa a forlate landet.  UNE ville sende sostrene tilbake til Ghana fordi de mente de kom til Norge med falske pass. I tillegg til uenigheter rundt passene mente de at sostrene hadde sterk nok tilknytning til Ghana fordi moren deres fortsatt bor der.  Brenda forklarer at hun ikke hadde et liv da hun bodde pa hemmelig adresse: - Det var veldig trist. Foto: Bent Lindsetmo / NRK  Brenda og Gloria har frem til rettssaken bodd pa hemmelig adresse.  - Jeg var redd for at politiet skulle ta meg og kaste meg ut.

Det er pa 820 kilo kokain, og er det storste kokainbeslaget noen gang gjort i Norge. Verdien er flere hundre millioner kroner. Forrige store beslag var i pa 153 kilo i november 2015.  Leder for Felles enhet for etterretning og etterforskning, Grete Lien Metlid gjentok flere ganger hvor viktig det er a na ut til smuglerne om at politiet har beslaglagt stoffet. Foto: Birgitte Wold Ingebretsen  - Det er tatt i Oslo by, men vi vil ikke si noe mer konkret om hvor i byen beslaget er gjort. Og det er viktig a si at ingen er pagrepet i saken, sier Metlid.  Beslag i banankasser  Kokainbeslaget ble gjort pa bananlageret til Bama i Oslo. Tolletatens folk tok seg inn pa lageret hvor det var losset flere hundre kasser med bananer. I et titalls av kassene fant tollerne kokainen.  Fortsatt er ingen pagrepet i saken, og etter det NRK forstar har ikke politiet mistanke mot Bama eller noen ansatte der. Kokainen er ikke lenger pa Bamas lager.  Kokainbeslaget ble gjort pa av Tollvesenet pa Bamas bananlager.  - Jeg kan bekrefte at beslaget ble gjort pa et Bama-anlegg i Oslo. Dette er en svaert alvorlig sak som er under etterforskning av politiet, og vi kommer derfor ikke til a gi ytterligere informasjon eller kommentarer, sier kommunikasjonsdirektor i Bama, Pia Gulbrandsen.  Politiet vet ikke hvem som er mottaker, men jobber etter flere hypoteser. En sentral teori er at partiet ble feilsendt til Norge, og at fruktkassene med kokain egentlig skulle sendes til et annet mottakerland.  Metlid sier at politiet gar ut med opplysningene na fordi de forutsetter at noen leter etter, og vil ha kontroll pa stoffet.  Politiet vil derfor gi smuglerne beskjed om at dette stoffet er beslaglagt.  Internasjonalt samarbeid  - Beslaget som er gjort i Oslo er mer enn dobbelt sa stort som det Tolletaten har beslaglagt totalt de siste fem arene, sier Tim Gurrik i Tolletaten.  Tolletaten har samarbeidet godt med kollegaer i Tyskland, sier omradeleder Tim Gurrik. Foto: Tolletaten  Gurrik sa under pressekonferansen torsdag kveld at de har et godt internasjonalt samarbeid.  Tidligere denne uka ble det gjort et beslag av 1200 kilo kokain i Brandenburg i Tyskland, gjemt i et fruktparti, forklarer omradelederen i Tolletaten.  BESLAG I TYSKLAND: Tirsdag gjorde tysk politi et rekordbeslag av 1200 kilo kokain i disse banankassene. Det ledet til beslag ogsa i Oslo. Foto: Tysk politi  Politiet i Tyskland opplyser i en pressemelding at kassene kom med en bat fra Ecuador. De tipset norsk politi om funnet. Tollvesenet fulgte opp tipset, og fant et stort parti fruktkasser som var blitt losset i Oslo.  Sikkerhetsrisiko  - Vi etterforsker saken med stor styrke i Oslo politidistrikt, sier Metlid.  De har valgt a ga ut med saken etter en totalvurdering. Og sier at nar det er snakk om sa store verdier som dette, kan det ogsa utgjore en sikkerhetsrisiko.  Hvor mye dette stoffet kunne blitt solgt for varierer.  - Vanligvis regner man ca. 1000 kr pr. gram ved kjop av sma kvanta, sier Ola Roed Bilgrei som er seniorforsker i FHI.  Men gateverdien avhenger av kvaliteten pa stoffet, hvor mye som selges, hvor det selges og relasjon mellom selger og kjoper, ifolge seniorforskeren.  Kan vaere et storre nettverk  Politiet sier de ikke kan utelukke at det kan vaere et storre nettverk som har tilknytning til Norge. Mye av narkotikatrafikken har bakgrunn i internasjonale nettverk, og er gjerne styrt fra utlandet.  - Vi fortsetter med etterforskning, og det blir viktig a fortsette et internasjonalt samarbeid, sier Metlid."}, {"source": "nrk", "title": "Evakuerer flere steder i Troms", "text": "Torsdag kveld besluttet Politimesteren i Troms a evakuere innbyggere i deler av omrader pa Breivikeidet, i Oldervik og pa Vasstrand i Tromso kommune.

Da fylkeskommunen gjorde det gjennom selskapet Fylkeshuset AS to manadar seinare, hadde aksjane meir enn tidobla seg i marknadsverdi.  50 prosent av R8Me, som to manadar tidlegare hadde kosta 0,45 millionar, kosta no fylkeskommunen 5 millionar - over ti gongar so mykje.

De har heller ikke fatt klare ordrer om hva de skal gjore, bortsett fra a angripe byen Vodjane.  - De som leder var avdeling er rene forbrytere, sier en av soldatene.  Nettsiden Astra har senere fortalt at denne avdelingen na er trukket tilbake til Donetsk by.

Soldatene hevder at 70 prosent av deres avdeling na er dode eller saret som folge av darlig planlegging.  Soldatene sier de er mobilisert fra St. Petersburg og fra Leningrad fylke, som omgir byen.  Disse soldatene har alle dekket til ansiktet.  Britisk etterretning: Den russiske haeren sliter  Samtidig har det britiske forsvarsdepartementet i sin daglige etterretningsrapport ogsa rapportert om store russisk tap i kampene om Avdijivka.  Pa Twitter skriver departementet at det 10. stridsvognregimentet trolig mistet de fleste stridsvognene sine da de forsokte a omringe Avdijivka fra sor.  De tre videoene som det her er snakk om viser en stor del soldater som er mobilisert, bade fra Russland men ogsa fra de omradene som russisk-stottede separatister har kontrollert siden 2014.  Det er altsa ikke soldater fra Wagner-gruppen, som har vaert sentrale i kampene om byen Bakhmut, og der de skal ha lidd svaert store tap.  Stadig nye graver  En fjerde video som na spres via sosiale medier, viser et opptak fra det som skal vaere en gravplass for soldater fra Wagner-gruppen. Videoen skal vaere tatt utenfor landsbyen i Krasnodar fylke sor i Russland.  Kirkegarden ved landsbyen Gorjatskij Klutsj er full av ferske graver, og ifolge kvinnen som snakker pa videoen, skal alle vaere drept i 2022 og 2023.  Mange dode. Bilder fra Krasnodar viser nye graver fra dode soldater i Wagner-haeren. Foto: Bilde fra Telegram  Videoene er delt via plattformen Telegram, som fremdeles kan brukes i Russland.  Det er trolig arsaken til at flere av opptakene med soldater som klager pa darlig ledelse i den russiske haeren, blir tatt pa alvor, blant annet av bloggere som folger den russiske haeren tett.  Om disse videoene er et bevis pa at moralen i den russiske haeren er i ferd med a bryte sammen, er vanskelig a si.  Det er svaert sjelden at russiske myndigheter erkjennet tap blant egne soldater. Sist de erkjente et stort tap var etter angrepet pa et skolebygg i Donetsk nyttsaften.  Ogsa den ukrainske haeren har lidd store tap. Trolig er mellom 10.000 og 20.000 ukrainske soldater dode etter at Russland gikk til storoffensiv 24. februar 2022.

He was released Thursday after posting $1,000 bond and is due back in court on March 2, per the Johnson County Sheriff's Office.  Gay is alleged to have caused criminal damage of less than $1,000.

Obviously, he's dealt with injuries in his career, and he dealt with a little bit of injury this season, but he's kept his mindset right. He kept working hard.

Now it's time to determine just how solid the footing is under Mike McCarthy.  After being upset at home by the San Francisco 49ers, the Dallas Cowboys coach has spent the week defending his play-calling decision in the game's final moments, one that cost Dallas a chance of potentially scoring a game-tying touchdown. Like Cowboys ownership, McCarthy has also been forced to answer questions about his job status at the end of a season in which his team won 12 games.   We had very positive conversations, just focused on the evaluation process,  McCarthy said Wednesday of his discussions with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.  On the surface, such a question seems wild. But for all of Dallas' achievements in 2021, the Cowboys' conclusion deserves closer examination -- and critique.   I think for people in this profession, it's accepted,  McCarthy said of the scrutiny.  It's part of the job. I get that. I understand why you're asking the question. It's part of the job. You have a job to do, and I have a job to do here today in answering your questions appropriately and respectfully. But, yeah, I don't put a lot into it because I know personally what I put into this.   I understand what goes on here every day. I know how to win. I know how to win in this league. I know how to win playoff games. I know how to win a championship. So I have great confidence in that. What we've built here in two seasons, I feel very good about, and I think with that you just stay true to that. The hard part is the personal. We all have kids, so that's the part that I don't like. I would hope people are respectful to that.   Dallas enjoyed quite a turnaround in 2021, going from a woeful 6-10 squad lacking its franchise quarterback to an explosive, ferocious team seemingly capable of making a deep playoff run. Such a sprint to a Super Bowl never materialized, though, with the Cowboys losing to the 49ers on Super Wild Card Weekend.  The fashion in which Dallas' season ended -- appearing unprepared, falling behind by 16 points and botching a final shot at the end zone -- was stunning to more than just Cowboys fans. After winning 12 games and the NFC East crown, the Cowboys have nothing more to show for it than a simple one-and-done postseason experience. Their No. 1 ranked offense mustered just 17 points and appeared to have no answer for whatever San Francisco was doing for much of the contest. When Dallas finally had a chance to potentially tie the game in the final moments, McCarthy and offensive coordinator Kellen Moore instead dialed up a quarterback draw, forcing Dak Prescott to scramble, then attempt to gather the offense in time to spike the ball and stop the clock.  We know how that played out. But Dallas' disappointment was about more than a final few plays, and one Cowboys legend was exasperated by McCarthy's lack of adjustments in the loss.   San Francisco rushed four guys, for the most part, they blitzed occasionally, but they're a four-man rush football team,  Hall of Fame quarterback and FOX analyst Troy Aikman told 96.7 The Ticket this week, via The Athletic's Jon Machota.  But a lot of times when you say that, then you think they're playing coverage. They mixed in some coverage, but there was a lot of single coverage on CeeDee Lamb.   I hate going back to (when I was playing) because nobody cares, but what I see around the league, it's not just Dallas, I've seen it with a lot of teams, a lot of these offenses want to scheme things. The coordinators, it's all about scheme, rather than 'this corner is playing soft. He's scared to death. Just run the route tree. Run a comeback. Run a dig route. Run a curl. Run anything.' You're going to complete the pass whenever you want. (Michael Irvin) would've had 10 catches at halftime if they played us the way they played CeeDee Lamb in that game."}, {"source": "nrk", "title": "Anklager IOC for narrespill - ett ord kan skape Bolsjunov-konflikt", "text": "- De var militaere i gar, men kan si at de ikke er det i morgen.

Grunnen er at de er offiserer i det russiske forsvaret.  <<Idrettsutovere som har kontrakt med russiske eller hviterussiske militaere eller nasjonale sikkerhetsbyraer kan ikke konkurrere>>, skev IOC i sine retningslinjer.  Ordet <<kontrakt>> er na blitt omstridt.  - Min spadom er at en fortolkning av dette ordet blir sentral i diskusjonen fremover, sier professor Sven G. Holtsmark ved Institutt for forsvarsstudier til NRK.  Professor Sven G. Holtsmark. Foto: Forsvaret  Holtsmark er ekspert pa det russiske forsvaret. Han papeker at ordet <<kontraktnik>> i Russland brukes om soldater i tjeneste.  Han er derfor ikke sikker pa at IOCs hensikt er a utestenge alle med militaer tilknytning. Samtidig papeker at han ikke har stor kunnskap om IOCs reglement.  Idrettsjurist Mark Orth frykter na at IOC driver et narrespill om forutsetningene, for at russiske utovere kan inkluderes.  Orth mener at reglene er vanskelig a handheve, og da spesielt kravet om at russiske utovere ikke kan vaere medlem av det militaeret.  Russiske stjerner som Aleksandr Bolsjunov har vaert utestengt fra internasjonal idrett i over ett ar. Fremover blir hans tilknytning til militaeret omstridt.

Da fungerer det ikke, rekkefolgen for bevisene er feil vei, sier Orth under et pressemote med blant annet NRK.  Raser mot IOC  Russiske myndigheter reagerte pa sin side sterkt pa retningslinjene fra IOC.  - Det er uakseptabelt, sa president Vladimir Putins talsmann Dmitrij Peskov om IOC-kravene.  Ifolge Reuters mener russiske myndigheter at de nye kravene fra IOC har <<elementer av diskriminering>>.  Det fikk mye oppmerksomhet da Aleksandr Bolsjunov og flere idrettsstjerner deltok pa et arrangement i Moskva, rett etter invasjonen. Det ble sett pa som et pr-arrangement for krigen i Ukraina. Her er han sammen med turneren Dina Averina og svommeren Jevgenij Rylov. Foto: Dmitry Azarov / Polaris  Men jusprofessor Trond Solvang ser flere grasoner og uklarheter i IOCs retningslinjer.  - Jeg vil tro at formalet med reglene tilsier at alle som star i en slik tjeneste, enten gjennom ordinaer ansettelse eller som sakalte kontraktorer, vil rammes. Men maten IOC har formulert det pa er for meg kryptisk, sier Solvang.  IOC har ogsa satt ned foten for russiske utovere som aktivt stotter krigen.  Solvang lurer pa hvor den grensen skal ga.  Jusprofessor Trond Solvang.  - Er generell stotte til det russiske regimets politikk tilstrekkelig? Ma ogsa selve krigforingen ha vaert stottet? Hva med at man ikke far lov a bruke ordet krigforing i Russland? Og hvordan skal disse undersokelsene gjennomfores, undrer Solvang.  Han lurer pa hvordan slike undersokelser skal gjennomfores. Han stiller ogsa sporsmal ved om de ulike idrettene kommer til a utfore dette pa samme mate.  Aktiv stotte  Da Championat skrev om den militaere forfremmelsen til Bolsjunov og Denis Spitsov, ble det to nettopp omtalt som tjenestegjorende i nasjonalgardens styrker. Det ble i artikkelen lenket til Nasjonalgardens sider.  Men denne lenken fungerer ikke lenger.  Holtsmark understreker at utovere som har en militaer grad, ogsa dersom det kalles en <<aeresgrad>> i praksis gir stotte til krigen.  - Om denne personen ikke har frasagt seg denne graden etter starten av Russlands invasjon av Ukraina i 2014, gir personen med dette sin aktive stotte til Russlands aggresjon, sier Holtsmark.  IOC-president Thomas Bach. Foto: Laurent Gillieron / AP  NRK spurte torsdag IOC-president Thomas Bach om en forklaring pa hva som menes med <<kontrakt med>> militaeret. Vi spurte ogsa om utovere som Bolsjunov, som er offiserer i Nasjonalgarden, kan returnere til internasjonal idrett.  - Det er virkelig et veldig kompleks problem, sier Bach til NRK.  Han forklarer at de har forespurt militaere- og idrettseksperter om dette.  - Det er mer eller mindre for a skille mellom den obligatoriske militaertjenesten, som i Russland er obligatorisk for alle menn i ett ar, og de som tjenestegjor av fri vilje etter det aret, i militaeret eller lignende tjenester, sier IOC-presidenten.  Han sier de derfor har anbefalt de internasjonale forbundene, som na har fatt i oppdrag a vurdere russisk deltagelse, a ha et uavhengig panel som kan svare pa disse sporsmalene.  - Der ma de ha en ekspert pa slike utfordringer, som ma se pa sak for sak og sikre en harmonisert tilnaerming i alle idretter.  Arrangementet pa Luzhniki stadion i Moskva i mars i fjor markerte attearsjubileet for annekteringen av Krim. Det var her flere idrettsutovere deltok. Det ble kritisert internasjonalt. Foto: YEVGENY BIYATOV / AFP  Holtsmark mener at utgangspunktet er at skistjernen Bolsjunov ikke kvalifiserer til a fa delta i internasjonal idrett na.  - Men som utenforstaende leser aner det meg at IOC bruker ordet kontrakt for a begrense dette til de i Russland som har tjenestekontrakt. Det er min hypotese, sier Holtsmark.  Uaktuelt  IOC har lagt opp til at det er de ulike idrettene som selv skal fa bestemme om de vil slippe til russiske og belarusiske utovere.  Norske Tore Boygard sitter i styret i Det internasjonale skiskytterforbundet (IBU). Det er na de ulike idrettene som skal bestemme om de russiske og belarusiske utoverne far komme tilbake.  Boygard sier at IBU ikke har planer om a endre noen ting, sa lenge kongressvedtaket deres star.  - Hvordan stiller du deg til IOC sine anbefalinger om russisk og belarusisk retur?  -Sann som situasjonen er na, er ikke tiden inne for a begynne a vurdere det, sier Boygard.

For noen ar siden sa fremtidsutsiktene for denne typen produksjon gode ut.  Tine oppfordret flere melkebonder til a legge om til okologisk produksjon. Ketil Erdal var en av dem som gjorde det.  Han matte kutte bruken av kunstgjodsel og bruke for uten sproytemiddel.

I tillegg far bondene 85 ore ekstra per liter melk de produserer. Noe som gjor at Erdal ikke gar i minus.  Men na er situasjonen snudd. Og mye skyldes at Forsvaret ikke kjoper like mye okologisk melk som de en gang gjorde i Nord-Norge.  Les ogsa: En bonde forteller: Derfor sviktet jeg dyrene mine  Forsvaret stovsugde markedet  I 2005 satte den davaerende regjeringen seg et mal om at 15 prosent av norsk matproduksjon og -forbruk skulle vaere okologisk.  Dette forte blant annet til at Forsvaret begynte a kjope okologisk melk. Mye okologisk melk.  I Nord-Norge forte det til at landsdelen ble stovsuget for slik melk.  Men i 2018 endret regjeringen retning.  I Nasjonal strategi for okologisk jordbruk er det ikke lenger noen direkte tallfestede mal. I stedet skal okologisk matproduksjon styres av ettersporselen.  Det forte til endringer i avtalen mellom Forsvaret og Tine.  I dagens avtale er det ingen krav til at Forsvaret skal kjope okologiske meieriprodukter.  - Alle kan bestille okologisk mat, men det er ikke lenger foringer pa det. Vi tilbyr okologiske produkter, og sa er det opp til avdelingene a bestille det de onsker, sier Hans Meisingset, seniorradgiver i Forsvarets logistikkorganisasjon (FLO).  Ifolge Meisingset er ettersporselen etter okologiske produktet lav i Forsvaret i dag. Noe Tine merker godt.  MULIGHET: Hans Meisingset kjenner ikke til prisforskjellen mellom okologisk og vanlig melk, men han understreker at alle avdelingene kan bestille de meieriprodukter de onsker. Foto: Torbjorn Kjosvold / Forsvaret  For de siste arene har de solgt mindre okologisk melk, saerlig i Nord-Norge.  - Salget er blitt sa lite at det er stor risiko for darligere kvalitet pa melka. Det kreves en viss mengde i tappinga pa meieriet for a sikre blant annet et stabilt fettinnhold. Na er mengden langt under denne grensa. Vi kan ikke lenger ta denne risikoen, sier Christian Granlund, konserndirektor for Tine Forsyning.  Na slutter de a tappe okologisk melk i Harstad.

Ketil Erdal i Steigen frykter at de ikke vil fa tillegget pa 85 ore per liter for melka de produserer lenger.  - De pengene utgjor veldig mye.

Vi har ingen okning i antall reklamasjoner, og sist, men ikke minst: holdbarheten er uendret. I flere tilfeller er det faktisk bedre, som folge av hyppigere tapping og lengre holdbarhetsdato pa okomelk fra Trondheim, sier Christian Granlund i Tine.  - Utslipp og miljobelastningen blir heller ikke storre, da vi utnytter transport som allerede frakter ferdigvarer nordover til Harstad.  Bade Coop og Norgesgruppen melder om godt salg av okologiske melkeprodukter i sine butikker. Men de selger ogsa okologiske produkter fra andre produsenter.  Ketil Erdal kjoper derfor ikke forklaringen til Tine.  - Hadde de markedsfort den okologiske melka og den da ikke hadde blitt solgt, ville jeg forstatt argumentet. Men vi opplever at de ikke har gjort det. Det er andre meierier som dominerer butikkhyllene i Nord-Norge, sier han.  - Nar de kjorer et prosjekt og ber oss legge om, sa er det spesielt at de snur. Vi foler vi har fulgt opp var del av prosjektet ved a produsere melka, og forventer at de folger opp sin del og markedsforer den.  Christian Granlund i Tine forstar frustrasjonen til melkebondene.  - Vi forstar ogsa at det er vanskelig a vaere motivert for okologisk produksjon nar okomelka na vil anvendes sammen med den vanlige melka, sier han.  - Men vi ma kunne garantere for kvaliteten pa produktene vare, og det volumet vi har tappet pa Harstad er sa lite at det ga stadig risiko for ujevn kvalitet."}, {"source": "nfl-news", "title": "NFL files motion to dismiss Jon Gruden lawsuit, compel arbitration", "text": "The NFL on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss lawsuits filed by Jon Gruden on Nov. 12 against the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell alleging the parties sought to raze Gruden's career with the release of private emails in which the former Raiders head coach used misogynistic, homophobic and racist terms.  Another motion was filed to compel arbitration. Both motions were filed in Clark County (Nev.) District Court.  Gruden's lawsuit alleges that the NFL and Goodell aimed to  destroy the career and reputation of Jon Gruden.   In its motion to dismiss, the NFL states that  the complaint -- a baseless attempt by Jon Gruden to blame the NFL and its Commissioner for the fallout from the publication of racist, misogynistic and homophobic emails that Gruden wrote and broadly circulated -- should be dismissed for failure to state a single viable cause of action.   Within the motion, it is also noted that Gruden does not dispute what was written in the emails, nor allege they were altered. Furthermore it states that  to the extent that Jon Gruden suffered any damage, he has no one to blame but himself  and therefore  the complaint should be dismissed in its entirety.   In the second motion, the league argues that  under the clear terms of Gruden's employment contract and the NFL's Constitution and Bylaws to which Gruden is bound,  arbitration is the proper forum for resolution and an order should be issued to stay the action.  In his lawsuit, Gruden is seeking  the recovery of money in excess of $15,000.00  in each of seven causes of action. He stepped down from his position as Raiders head coach following the release of articles in The Wall Street Journal and New York Times that detailed his aforementioned emails reportedly ranging from 2010 to 2018.  On the day in which the lawsuits were filed, the league issued a statement categorizing them as disreputable.

Garoppolo is expected to play, but will not be 100 percent in the San Francisco 49ers' Divisional Round contest Saturday night against the top-seeded Green Bay Packers, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Wednesday.  Garoppolo, who has a torn ligament and bone chip in his right thumb, sprained his right shoulder in the second quarter of the 49ers' wild-card win against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.  On Tuesday, when asked if he was confident he would play on Saturday, Garoppolo was somewhat non-committal.

One of them was undoubtedly his health. The Browns quarterback played through injuries to his foot, knee and non-throwing shoulder, the last of which required surgery.  Mayfield underwent surgery for his torn labrum Wednesday and posted a short video afterward deeming it a  complete success.  He is expected to begin light throwing in April and make a full recovery by the start of training camp, per a team statement.   I checked that box off to get this fixed and now it's on the way to the road to recovery,  Mayfield said.  This is one of those steps to get back to my true self. This past year hasn't been very easy.   As a fourth-year starter, Mayfield hardly resembled the player who led Cleveland to the playoffs just last season. By some metrics, he was worse than he'd ever been. His completion percentage, yards per game, touchdown passes, interceptions, and sacks taken all regressed, while his team went from Super Bowl hopefuls to postseason rejects.  Mayfield figures to have an opportunity to turn it around with the Browns. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero reported earlier this month that the club plans to keep Mayfield as its 2022 starter, a sentiment general manager Andrew Berry echoed a few days later.

Ben Roethlisberger is all but retired, pending an official announcement, and head coach Mike Tomlin and the club are proceeding under the assumption that Big Ben will hang it up.  NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday that a likely scenario is current Steelers quarterbacks Dwayne Haskins and Mason Rudolph will have a shot at competing for the spot, while Pittsburgh also adds a QB in the draft.  It's an opportunity ahead that Rudolph and Haskins are each relishing.  Paramount in either emerging as the Steelers' QB1 will be exhibiting leadership and playing to their potential.   I can maybe be a bit more myself, being the leader that I've always been at the quarterback position and not worried about stepping on the toes of a longtime Hall of Fame player,  Rudolph said, via ESPN's Brooke Pryor.  Said Haskins:  I definitely feel like I could be a starter in this league. I got drafted for that reason. I definitely believe I have talent to play with the best of them, but really, I just haven't put it all together yet. And that's something I have to do this offseason in order to put myself in that position to play.   Haskins didn't play at all in 2021 for the Steelers after signing with them in the offseason.  The 15th overall selection in the 2019 NFL Draft by the Washington Football Team, Haskins proved to be a bust for Washington. He lasted just two seasons and was 3-10 as a starter with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.  As a hopeful reclamation project under the tutelage of Tomlin, Haskins was signed to a reserve/futures contract last year. He's set to become a restricted free agent, but is grateful for the prospect of a second chance with the Steelers.   They're giving me a chance to compete and I have a chance to start,  Haskins said.  That's all I could ask for.   Rudolph had a chance previously to show his mettle as the Steelers' starter with Roethlisberger injured in 2019. Pittsburgh's 2018 third-round draft choice largely struggled, going 5-3 as a starter with 1,765 yards, 13 touchdowns and nine interceptions and an 82.0 QB rating.   I'm ready to get the opportunity again to prove myself,  Rudolph said.  I understand what I've put on tape in 2019, and up to this point, there's still question marks on my game, and I want to prove those people wrong. And I want to prove to myself and to my teammates.

The new series, created by current franchise mastermind Alex Kurtzman and writer Noga Landau (The CW's Nancy Drew) will, according to the official news release,  introduce us to a young group of cadets who come together to pursue a common dream of hope and optimism. Under the watchful and demanding eyes of their instructors, they will discover what it takes to become Starfleet officers as they navigate blossoming friendships, explosive rivalries, first loves and a new enemy that threatens both the Academy and the Federation itself.   The announcement comes in the wake of news that Star Trek: Discovery, the flagship show of the CBS All Access/Paramount Plus Trek reboot, will conclude after season 5 in 2024. But based on the announcement from Kurtzman and Landau, Starfleet Academy might keep the 32nd-century Discovery timeline alive, rather than veer the entire franchise back to the more familiar eras of Star Trek: Picard and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Those who kept up with Discovery will recall that in Discovery season 4, fan favorite Lieutenant Tilly (played by Mary Wiseman) accepted a job at a reopened Starfleet Academy -- putting her in a perfect position to pop up in the spinoff.   Admission is now open to Starfleet Academy!  Kurtzman and Landau write in their announcement statement.  For the first time in over a century, our campus will be re-opened to admit individuals a minimum of 16 Earth years (or species equivalent) who dream of exceeding their physical, mental and spiritual limits, who value friendship, camaraderie, honor and devotion to a cause greater than themselves. The coursework will be rigorous, the instructors among the brightest lights in their respective fields, and those accepted will live and study side-by-side with the most diverse population of students ever admitted. Today we encourage all who share our dreams, goals and values to join a new generation of visionary cadets as they take their first steps toward creating a bright future for us all. Apply today!

The toy company, which has business in the United States, is best known for its anime and gaming figurines. Its Nendoroid and Figma lines in particular are popular with collectors for their licensed figures: Good Smile has toy lines for games like Overwatch, League of Legends, Horizon Zero Dawn, and Cyberpunk 2077. Both Nintendo and Sega have licensed their characters for toys based on franchises like Kirby, Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Sonic, and Animal Crossing. The Walt Disney Company is also a major partner, with dozens of Nendoroid toys for its different franchises, including Marvel and Star Wars.  Good Smile was required to file documents with the New York attorney general's office during an investigation into 4chan's role in the 2022 racist mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed and three were injured. These documents outline how 4chan owner Hiroyuki Nishimura acquired the message board, inspired by Japanese message board 2channel that Nishimura founded, from 4chan creator Christopher Poole in 2015. Nishimura put up most of the money for 4chan; Good Smile Company purchased a 30% share in a $2.4 million investment, Wired reported, and has been quietly involved in the website for years.  A Good Smile representative confirmed to Polygon in 2021 that the toy company was a  passive investor  in 4chan, but did not share the scope of the deal. News of the Japanese company's investment was first alleged in lawsuit filings obtained by Polygon; Good Smile and two of its former employees counter-sued each other over a contract dispute related to a Stranger Things drive-in event. Guy Brand and James Young-sik Kim, the two former employees, also accused Good Smile of tax evasion, discrimination, and selling  over-sexualized anime figures depicting minors.  That's where the 4chan connection came in, too -- Brand and Kim called out the the anonymous image forum for its associations with mass shooters, QAnon, and white nationalism. The two alleged that Good Smile had a 4chan office in its Tokyo headquarters and profited off the site. The lawsuit was later settled out of court.  The New York attorney general Letitia James will not pursue criminal charges against 4chan or its owners, but  at least one other law enforcement agency is still investigating the website,  Wired reported.  4chan has been a controversial site for years, but was pushed into the public eye after the Buffalo shooting. The shooter's 180-page manifesto references racism and antisemitism often found on the site. Some also credit 4chan as a breeding ground for QAnon conspiracies, white supremacy, and propaganda. Surface level, the forum isn't only used for those reasons -- it's also got gaming, cooking, and entertainment boards. But that influence is a dangerous uncurrent running throughout the site.  Good Smile is reportedly looking to divest from 4chan, according to the report.  Good Smile's connections to 4chan have made partners  anxious,  Wired said. Disney, one of Good Smile's biggest partnerships, will not renew its deal with the toy maker after Wired informed the company of its involvement in 4chan, according to the report. Polygon has reached out to Disney and several other companies -- Riot Games, Sega, Blizzard Entertainment, and Nintendo -- that have licensed characters for Good Smile's toys.

The carmaker said it raised the starting price of the Lariat Standard model to $75,974 from $74,474 and the Platinum range to $98,074 from $96,874  in response to current material costs, market factors, and supply chain constraints.   Shares of Ford closed up 2% on Thursday.  The move underscores the red-hot demand for the electric version of the gasoline-powered F-150 truck, which has been the subject of some songs due to its popularity, and comes at a time when market leader Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has triggered a price war.   Ahead of the next wave of commercial order banks opening mid-April, Ford is adjusting the price of the F-150 Lightning Pro MSRP from $55,974 to $59,974,  Ford said, adding that the model remains sold-out for retail customers.

Bryan Hill (Killmonger, Batman and the Outsiders) is set to write the new ongoing series, with art by Elena Casagrande (Black Widow, Trial of the Amazons) -- and that's a pretty good combo. Hill is a great adventure writer with a smart sense of character; Casagrande draws some of the best fight scenes in modern superhero comics.   I think that the first goal of drawing a fight scene is to let it be powerful and fluid at the same time,  Casagrande told Polygon via email.  I see fighting like dancing, so my first thought is always about choreography and then the movements that I need to make strong. Obviously every character needs a different choreography, a different way to fight -- it's fun to personalize it -- and with Blade, I'm happy to have the chance to use the swords and showcase his strength.   What's up with Blade in Marvel Comics today? Well, he was sheriff of Chernobyl for a bit, after Dracula finagled the disaster site into becoming a sovereign vampire nation. And he just met his secret daughter, Brielle Brooks, who's growing into her very own vampire slayer powers. Judging by Marvel's official summary of the first issue, this series will be blazing a new trail, with Blade  unknowingly  unleashing a  dark, ancient power  and having to deal with the consequences -- but we won't know for sure until Blade #1 hits shelves in July.

Credit Suisse will pay an interest rate equal to the current Swiss National Bank's policy rate of 1.5% plus 0.5% for access to the emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) scheme, the central bank said on Thursday.  The facility requires loans to be covered by collateral in the form of mortgages and pledged securities.  In measures announced alongside the emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by rival UBS engineered by the authorities, the two banks were also given access to 100 billion francs in additional liquidity assistance (ELA+).  This central bank assistance is available to the banks at an interest of 3% plus its policy rate.  Credit Suisse was also given access to an additional 100 billion franc public liquidity backstop, for which it has to pay a 3% risk premium evenly split between the national bank and the Swiss state.  On top of this Credit Suisse owes Switzerland a 0.25% commitment premium for the public liquidity backstop.

REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert                WASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that banking regulation and supervisory rules need to be re-examined in the wake of the Silicon Valley Bank (SIVB.O) and Signature Bank (SBNY.O) failures to ensure current banking system risks are addressed.  In remarks prepared for delivery to the National Association for Business Economics, Yellen also called for stronger regulation of the growing non-bank, or  shadow bank , sector, including money market funds, hedge funds and crypto assets.  Yellen said a 2018 roll-back of bank capital requirements and stronger supervision for smaller and mid-size banks with assets below $250 billion should be re-examined.   Any time a bank fails, it is cause for serious concern. Regulatory requirements have been loosened in recent years. I believe it is appropriate to assess the impact of these deregulatory decisions and take any necessary actions in response,  Yellen said.  She added that regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis have helped the U.S. financial system weather shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic.   But the failures of two regional banks this month demonstrate that our business is unfinished,  Yellen said. adding that the financial system was significantly stronger than it was 15 years ago.   This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that we've seen relative stability in the overall banking sector this month, even as concerns grew about specific institutions,  she said.  But Yellen said it was important that U.S. regulatory authorities examine whether the current supervisory and regulatory regimes  are adequate for the risks that banks face today. We must act to address these risks if necessary.   Yellen's remarks contained no specific proposals and she acknowledged that tighter regulation imposes costs and care should be taken to ensure the health and competitiveness of community and regional banks. But she added that such costs  pale in comparison to the tragic costs of financial crises.   Yellen repeated comments last week that the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation were prepared to again use the same tools they used to protect depositors in the SVB and Signature Bank failures.   And we would be prepared to take additional actions if warranted,  she added, without specifying steps that could be taken.  NON-BANK RISKS  Yellen called for more regulation to address risks emanating from non-bank institutions, including liquidity risks, and said rules should not allow risks to shift elsewhere in the financial system to avoid regulation.  Money market mutual funds and open-end funds are still susceptible to runs, Yellen said, which the Securities and Exchange Commission has sought to address through new regulatory proposals.  In hedge funds, which had nearly $10 trillion in gross assets in 2021, Yellen said she had concerns about the use of leverage by some funds, which could force them into a position of conducting  fire sales  of assets including Treasury securities during times of stress - sales that could spill over to other financial system participants.  The multi-regulator Financial Stability Oversight Council's restored Hedge Fund Working Group will continue to monitor risks and develop policy recommendations, Yellen said.  She also said the Biden administration is continuing to study the potential for systemic risks from digital assets, an effort that began before the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.  Of particular concern are stablecoins, which invest in reserve assets to maintain a stable value against the dollar. Like traditional funds, they could also be forced into asset fire sales in times of stress, she said.   A run on one stablecoin can lead to panicked runs on other stablecoins - causing even broader selloffs,  Yellen said, adding that Congress should pass legislation to establish a comprehensive prudential regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers and for other digital assets.  Yellen also said that a failure by Congress to raise the debt limit, leading to a default on U.S. obligations, was another financial risk that  could upend the lives of millions of Americans and those around the world.

His keynote speech, delivered at a business and political summit in the island province of Hainan, came in a week Beijing has mounted a charm offensive on overseas firms as it seeks to shore up an economy battered by years of pandemic restrictions.  But the prospects for a speedy recovery are clouded by strained relations with the U.S. and its allies over issues including its cosy ties with Russia, muscular stance towards Taiwan and fears about its use of sensitive technologies.   No matter what changes take place in the world, we will always adhere to reform and opening up...We will introduce a series of new measures in expanding market access and optimising the business environment,  Li, who took office this month, told the panel at the annual Boao Forum.   A confident, open, and willing to share China must be a huge force for world prosperity and stability,  he said.  Li, who spoke alongside the prime ministers of Malaysia, Singapore and Spain, earlier this week told a group of foreign executives, including Apple Inc's Tim Cook, at a summit in Beijing that China was  unswervingly  committed to opening up.  In his maiden speech after he took office, Li pledged to ease a sweeping regulatory crackdown and support private enterprises. In a sign that stance may already be bearing fruit, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (9988.HK) announced this week it was planning to break up its empire and explore several fundraisings or listings.  But three years of rigid border controls and a series of sweeping lockdowns during the pandemic have sapped business confidence in China, especially among foreign firms, according to sentiment surveys.  Those COVID curbs were abruptly dropped in December, and Li said on Thursday there were signs a recovery was starting to take hold.   Judging from the situation in March, it's better than in January and February. In particular, major economic indicators such as consumption and investment continue to improve, while employment and prices are generally stable,  Li said.  China has set itself a modest target for gross domestic product growth of around 5% this year, after significantly missing its target for 2022. That is lower than what the International Monetary Fund and some private forecasters think it can achieve.  For some at the conference, Li's message to business did not go unnoticed.   I see a lot more determination in conveying the message that China is indeed back open for business,  said Denis Depoux, global managing director at consultancy Roland Berger.  'CHAOS AND CONFLICTS'  But there were also cautionary notes.  In veiled comments aimed at the United States, which is working with its allies to stymie China's access to advanced technologies such as microchips, Li said Beijing opposed trade protectionism and decoupling.  Speaking on the same panel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said protectionism would represent  a return to the past  and damage relations between China and Europe.  But hours after his speech, the European Commission said it was examining measures to control outbound investment to prevent certain sensitive technologies going to rivals such as China.  Li's attempt to win over business also comes at a time of fierce rhetoric with the United States, its biggest export market.  Taiwan, the democratically ruled island that China claims as its territory, has been a particular bone of contention.  In the latest escalation, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen arrived in New York on Wednesday for the first of two U.S stopovers that Beijing has called provocative.  In his speech, Li said  chaos and conflicts  must not happen in Asia and that China would act as an  anchor  for global peace.

The mass dismissals come despite a $1.3 billion gross profit that EA reported for its latest fiscal quarter, according to financial statements given to investors in January. Still, the company at the time also lowered its full year profit expectations, despite revenue and profit increases over the same quarterly period the year prior.   Even amidst macro uncertainty, EA is operating from a position of strength,  Wilson said in announcing the layoffs. He said EA is  gaining momentum,  but still announced the layoffs a few paragraphs later.  Wilson did not specify which segments of the company would be impacted by the layoffs; he said only that EA will pull away from projects that don't align with its strategy:  building games and experiences that entertain massive online communities; creating blockbuster interactive storytelling; and amplifying the power of community in and around our games with social and creator tools,  he said.  Wilson specifically called out The Sims 4, EA Sports FIFA 23, and Apex Legends for their success. It's likely the company will focus on support for Madden 23, Battlefield 2042, and beyond, as well as Star Wars Jedi: Survivor once that launches at the end of April. EA developer Maxis is also working on The Sims 5, surely a key project in EA's portfolio.  Electronic Arts has already said that Battlefield 1943, Battlefield: Bad Company, and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 will be removed from online stores in April, but these catalog reductions don't seem to be related to the layoffs.  Wilson said some workers may be reassigned to other projects; those who aren't will get severance pay and  additional benefits.  The company began announcing personnel changes  earlier this quarter,  which are expected to continue into  early next fiscal year,  which starts in October. EA laid off 200 Apex Legends QA testers in February, according to Kotaku.  EA's significant layoffs follow a number of others by its industry peers: 400 Twitch employees were let go among Amazon's recent termination of 9,000 employees. Microsoft laid off 10,000 workers earlier in the year, reportedly impacting studios like Starfield developer Bethesda Softworks and Halo Infinite developer 343 Industries. Elsewhere, Take-Two, Unity, and several others have followed suit with layoffs, most citing macro-economic uncertainty.  Big companies typically blame these sorts of layoffs on slowing growth. (EA also stated it was  reviewing  its real estate investments.) Such layoffs may not actually cut costs, some experts say -- and the dismissals may simply be companies  copying  their peers, according to The Verge.

The 31-year-old Bankman-Fried entered his plea to a new, 13-count indictment through his lawyer, Mark Cohen, at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court.  Bankman-Fried previously pleaded not guilty to eight counts of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly stealing billions in FTX customer funds to plug losses at his hedge fund, Alameda Research.  The former billionaire could spend decades in prison if convicted at a trial set to start on Oct. 2.  Bankman-Fried was arrested in December and extradited from the Bahamas, where FTX was based.  The exchange collapsed in November after a flurry of customer withdrawals spurred by concerns about commingling of funds between FTX and Alameda.  In an unusual post-arrest blog post, Bankman-Fried admitted that FTX had inadequate risk management but said he did not steal funds.  Cohen said he planned to challenge by a May 8 deadline the campaign finance and China-related charges because they were brought after Bankman-Fried's extradition.

Representatives of the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan and the Bahamas Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no immediate comment.  Bankman-Fried's original indictment contained few details about his alleged scheme.  A 12-count indictment filed in late February elaborated on the fraud charges, and accused Bankman-Fried of illegally contributing tens of millions of dollars to U.S. political campaigns through straw donors, to buy influence in Washington.  On Tuesday, yet another indictment accused Bankman-Fried of orchestrating a $40 million bribe to Chinese authorities to regain access to $1 billion of cryptocurrency in frozen Alameda accounts.  Three former members of Bankman-Fried's inner circle - former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, former FTX technology chief Zixao  Gary  Wang, and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh - have all pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.  Apart from his court appearances, Bankman-Fried is confined to his parents' Palo Alto, California, home as a condition of his $250 million bail package.

Florida lawmakers passed a bill in February giving Governor Ron DeSantis effective control over a board that oversees municipal services and development in a special district that encompasses Walt Disney World resort.  But before the takeover by DeSantis's appointees, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) pushed through changes to the special tax district agreement that limit the board's action for decades, according to the Orlando Sentinel, which quoted lawyers for the board who spoke at a meeting on Wednesday.   It completely circumvents the authority of this board to govern,  board member Brian Aungst Jr. was quoted as saying.  A spokesperson for the board said the supervisors characterized the prior board's actions as an  eleventh hour  act that effectively ties their hands and limits their ability to do their jobs.  DeSantis's press office could not be reached for comment, however his former press secretary, Christina Pushaw, tweeted that Disney  got a rude awakening  and would be held accountable.

The collapse of U.S.-lender Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in early March after heavy losses on its bond portfolio as rates climbed was a wake-up call for markets that monetary tightening will likely bring more pain.  Since late 2021, big developed economies including the United States, euro area and Australia have raised rates by almost 3,300 basis points collectively.  Reuters Graphics  Here's a look at some potential pressure points.  1/ BANKS  Banks remain at the top of the worry list after the collapse of SVB, as well as Credit Suisse's forced merger with UBS, sparked turmoil across the banking sector.  Investors are alert to which other banks might be sitting on unrealised losses in government bonds, the prices of which have dropped sharply as rates have risen.  The SVB bond portfolio losses have highlighted similar risks for Japanese lenders' gigantic foreign bond holdings, which carry over 4 trillion yen ($30 billion) in unrealised losses.  Japanese, European and U.S. banks stocks, while off recent lows, are still well below levels seen just before SVB's collapse.  Reuters Graphics  2/ DARLINGS NO MORE  As the SVB collapse showed, stress in the tech sector can quickly ripple out across the economy.  Tech firms are reversing pandemic-era exuberance, with Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Meta (META.O) in March conducting their latest rounds of layoffs after years of hiring sprees.  Housing markets in U.S. tech hubs such as Seattle and San Jose are cooling more rapidly than in other regions, real estate broker Redfin Corp says.  In commercial property, a restructuring by Pinterest (PINS.N) will see the social media company exit office leases.  Investors wary of global stress should keep their eyes on Silicon Valley, as ructions in this major U.S. industry cause aftershocks in Europe and beyond.  Share of employees laid off in US tech companies  3/ DEFAULT RISKS  Rising rates pose a threat to sub-investment grade companies, which have to pay up when refinancing their maturing debt and risk defaulting on it.  S&P expects U.S. and European default rates to reach 3.75% and 3.25%, respectively by September, more than double the 1.6% and 1.4% in September 2022. Pessimistic forecasts of 6.0% and 5.5% not  out of the question , it says.  Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid wrote this week that  corporates are more levered now than during the great financial crisis and this cycle could ultimately be more corporate default focused versus financials.   Reuters Graphics  4/ CRYPTO WINTER  Having benefited from an influx of cash during the easy-money era, cryptocurrencies have felt pain as rates rose last year, then gained on recent signs that tightening could end soon.  The most popular cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has been an unexpected beneficiary of broader market turmoil, surging around 40% in just 10 days.  Analysts attributed the gains to market expectations that rate hikes were nearing their peak, support risk-sensitive assets such as bitcoin .  But there are reasons for caution towards crypto assets -- the collapse of various high-profile crypto firms last year left crypto customers shouldering large losses, while U.S. authorities are increasingly cracking down on the crypto sector's largest players.  Reuters Graphics  5/ FOR SALE  Rising rates operate with a time lag, which means the impact on rate-sensitive housing markets has yet to be fully felt.  A distressed debt index compiled by law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges showed that real estate remains the most distressed sector by some margin in Europe and the UK.  Economists are also worried that commercial property could be the next shoe to drop if global banking woes trigger a broader credit crunch for the multi-trillion-dollar sector that was already under pressure.  Capital Economics said that U.S. commercial real estate (CRE) prices have fallen by 4-5% from their peak in mid-2022 and expects a further 18-20% drop.  The reliance of the sector on lending from small and mid-tier banks -- which provide about 70% of outstanding loans to CRE -- is worrisome as those banks are facing pressure on their deposit base, the firm noted.

The Turkish parliament was the last among the 30 members of the Western defence alliance to ratify Finland's membership after Hungary's legislature approved a similar bill on Monday.  Sweden has also sought NATO membership as a response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. One of Russia's main justifications for the invasion was to prevent the Western military alliance from expanding. The alliance and its members have supplied Kyiv with military and economic aid.

The Wall Street Journal/Handout via REUTERS 1 2 3 4 5   Soon both Finland and Sweden will be members, meaning that President Putin is getting the exact opposite of what he wanted,  NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told Fox News.  He wanted less NATO. He is getting more NATO.   Ukraine said Russian forces pressed on with their assault in the east, in particular on Bakhmut and nearby towns as well as on the town of Avdiivka, about 60 km (37 miles) to the southwest of Bakhmut.  Bakhmut has been the site of the bloodiest infantry battle in Europe since World War Two, with Russian forces seeking their first victory since mid-2022.   Our defences are holding the city and repelling numerous enemy attacks,  Ukraine's military said on Facebook on Thursday evening.  Ukrainian military analyst and journalist, Andriy Tsaplienko, interviewed on Ukrainian NV Radio, said Russian forces were trying to repeat in Avdiivka what happened in Bakhmut.   The city is under constant, daily shelling. They understand that they cannot simply capture it and instead are starting to destroy Avdiivka as much as possible,  Tsaplienko said.  Reuters could not independently confirm the battlefield reports.  The Ukrainian military had said a day earlier that Russian fighters were having some success in Bakhmut. Evhen Dikyi, a Ukrainian military analyst interviewed on Ukrainian NV Radio, said Russian forces controlled more than half the city.   I can tell you that Bakhmut is holding firm. But there is heavy fighting in the city and it is getting closer to the city centre,  he said.   If Russian forces are reported to have made 'some progress' it is probably because they have crossed the Bakhmutka River. They have come wave upon wave and we are talking about a few hundred metres,  Dikyi added.  A month ago, the Ukrainian military seemed likely to abandon Bakhmut but has since decided to stay and fight for it, hoping to exhaust and deplete Russia's attacking force.  Russia's invasion has destroyed Ukrainian cities and set millions of civilians to flight. Tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers on both sides are believed to have died.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson was sticking by plans to allow mixing indoors and greater physical contact in England as scientists warned the strain could be 50% more transmissible than the variety detected in Kent.  Health minister Edward Argar said the Government was acting  coolly  and  calmly  in carrying on with step three in the road map to ending lockdown restrictions.  However, the British Medical Association said the move is a  real worry  while many are still awaiting vaccination.  Mr Argar was also forced to defend border restrictions, saying it is  impossible to completely hermetically seal  the nation amid criticism of the delay in adding India to the travel red list.  Mr Johnson warned yesterday that the variant could cause  serious disruption  to plans to ease the lockdown and may delay the planned ending of all legal restrictions on 21 June.  The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies concluded there is a  realistic possibility  the strain is 50% more transmissible than the one that emerged in Kent last year.  If the higher transmissibility is confirmed, the experts said moving to step three could  lead to a substantial resurgence of hospitalisations  that is  similar to, or larger than, previous peaks .  Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast:  All the evidence so far suggests there is no evidence of increased severity of illness or that it evades the vaccine.   So, at the moment, on the basis of the evidence we are doing the right thing, coolly, calmly continuing with Monday, but keeping everything under review.   Monday's easing will allow people to socialise indoors in homes, pubs and restaurants, and will permit physical contact between households for the first time in more than a year.  Latest coronavirus stories  Mr Argar said people should take personal responsibility when deciding whether or not to hug loved ones, when allowed to do so.   You have to take all the facts into consideration,  he said.  It's about personal responsibility, it's about making the right judgment call.   The BMA's public health medicine committee co-chairman Dr Richard Jarvis urged the public to take a  cautious approach  to social and physical contact.   With key segments of the population still not vaccinated and clusters of variants, including the rapidly increasing Indian variant, becoming a growing concern, we must approach this next stage of easing lockdown with the utmost caution,  he said.   It is a real worry that when further measures lift on May 17, the majority of younger people, who are often highly socially mobile and could therefore be most at risk of a more infectious strain, are not yet vaccinated.   To combat the variant's spread, people aged over 50 and the clinically vulnerable will have their second doses of a Covid vaccine accelerated.  Surge testing is also under way in several places in England including areas of Bolton, Blackburn, Sefton and London.  Public Health England data shows a rise in cases of the Indian variant of concern from 520 to 1,313 this week in the UK.  Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth accused the Prime Minister of a  reckless failure to protect our borders .  India was not added to the travel red list requiring quarantine in a Government-sanctioned hotel until 23 April, having announced the move four days earlier.  Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons home affairs committee, accused the Government of having  inexplicably delayed  the move  after which many thousands of people had returned from India bringing in many hundreds of new variant cases .   This was predictable but it was not inevitable,  she said, accusing ministers of having  still not learned the basic lessons at the border .  Mr Argar told BBC Radio 4's Today programme  it is impossible to completely hermetically seal the borders of the country .   Our border controls, for want of a better way of putting it, to reduce the risk of an importation of a new variant of the disease are among the toughest in the world,  he said.  Questioned why Bangladesh and Pakistan were added to the red list two weeks ahead of India, Mr Argar said the decisions were made  on the basis of the evidence, based on a number of factors .  Meanwhile, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said vaccines are  almost certainly less effective  at reducing transmission of the Indian variant.  But Professor Anthony Harnden said it is not believed the strain evades the vaccines' effectiveness in preventing severe disease.  He defended the approach of bringing forward second jabs rather than speeding up the rollout to younger people, saying targeting more vulnerable people with full immunity is a  better strategy .   The vaccines may be less effective against transmission and immunity takes a number of weeks to develop, so it's not a very good strategy for preventing transmission, what we want is to prevent disease,  he told Today.   From a vaccination strategy it just won't help mass-vaccinating a number of young people at the expense of older people who haven't been vaccinated.

RTE News understands that proposals set to be considered by Cabinet on Tuesday could see a circular issued to local authorities from next week detailing something called a density specification.  This would mean that permission would not be granted for the sale of homes to a single buyer if the estate was under a certain density or size.  The final specification is still being examined but it might mean, for example, that developments with something in the order of 40 home units per hectare could not be purchased by investors.  There is a view in Government that such a measure would protect traditional family homes from so-called 'cuckoo funds'.  A second proposal is also set to be looked at by Government next Tuesday.

This measure could be introduced through an amendment to legislation, possibly to the Affordable Housing Bill, which is likely to be passed by the Oireachtas before the summer break.

Travellers from European Union countries with coronavirus rates below 500 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period can make  all types of visits to Portugal, including even non-essential visits,  the ministry said in a statement.  Tourists from Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland are also allowed to start flying to Portugal.  Visitors will have to show proof of a negative test taken up to 72 hours before a flight and airlines will be fined between EUR500 and EUR2,000 for each passenger who boards without presenting proof of a negative test.  The ministry said restrictions, limited to essential trips, would be maintained for five EU countries - Cyprus, Croatia, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden - plus Brazil, India and South Africa.  Yesterday, Portugal said it will allow holidaymakers from Britain to enter the country from Monday, prompting a sigh of relief from hotel owners already inundated with bookings after Britain's go-ahead for travel from that day.  Britain added Portugal, whose economy heavily depends on tourism, to a  green  list of foreign destinations a week ago, allowing Britons to travel there without needing to quarantine for Covid-19 when returning home.  European Union rules prohibit non-essential travel from outside the bloc, making Portugal's decision to allow in UK tourists an exception.   We're very excited about this news. The repercussion of the decision is being felt by every type of hotel, from hostels to five-star,  said Eliderico Viegas, head of the Algarve regional hotel association.  Airline EasyJet, which added around 100,000 extra seats for flights to Portugal over the summer, and British travel agency Thomas Cook, where bookings to Portugal tripled over the past week, also welcomed the news.

Bars and restaurants can now offer outdoor service, with indoor service due to reopen with limited capacity on 28 May. Since October, they have been able to serve only take-away food.  Additionally, Poles are no longer required to wear masks outside in places where they can observe social distancing.

Here in Ireland, demonstrations took place in Dublin, Cork and Galway.  A spokesperson for the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign said it held  a socially distanced and masked event, forming a square of flag-waving supporters, from the Ha'penny bridge to O'Connell Bridge  in the capital.  The spokesperson said there were 15 people on each of the four sides of the two bridges.      The Chair of the IPSC, Fatin Al Tamimi, said:  We wanted to show our support for Palestinians, who are being evicted from their homes in East Jerusalem, attacked with stun grenades at prayer in the Al aqsa Mosque, and now being bombed indiscriminately in Gaza.   Whole families including children have been killed in their homes with no mercy. The occupation of Palestine, and its illegal settlements, has got to end, and freedom and human rights be restored to the Palestinian people.   A separate protest, featuring several hundred people, took place outside the Israeli Embassy in Dublin. The crowd marched there after meeting at the Spire in O'Connell Street.  In a statement, gardai said it would carry out an investigation into  the organiser or organisers of this protest  adding that  public health regulations in relation to organised outdoor gatherings of a certain size (current limit is 15 people) are in place .

There is no permit/authorisation required for such events .  In Paris, police officers used tear gas and water cannon to try and disperse a pro-Palestinian rally held despite a ban by authorities, who fear a flare-up of anti-Semitic violence during the worst fighting between Israel and Hamas in years.  Thousands of people converged in the heavily immigrant Barbes neighbourhood in the north of the French capital, defying orders issued by loudspeakers that the march was illegal.  Riot police use water cannons during a Palestinian demonstration in Paris  In London, several thousand protesters carrying placards reading  Stop Bombing Gaza  and chanting  Free Palestine  converged on Marble Arch, near Hyde Park, to march towards the Israeli embassy.  Former British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told the crowd that international action provides  succour, comfort and support  to those suffering in the conflict.   Think what it's like being a mother or father and seeing a building bombed in front of you, knowing your family is in there, and you can do nothing,  he said.  A Metropolitan Police officer received treatment for a head injury following the protest in central London.  Writing on Twitter, the force said:  Two people were arrested and subsequently de-arrested. One officer is receiving treatment after suffering a head injury.   Former British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn speaking during a demonstration in London   It's our global voices that will give succour, comfort and support in those settlements alongside Gaza and all over the West Bank, East Jerusalem who are suffering at this time.   End the occupation now. End all the settlements now and withdraw then. End the siege of Gaza now.

Israel has an international legal obligation to protect children in conflict and are not doing so! Ireland will speak forcefully again at UNSC tomorrow.   He later responded to a tweet by the UNICEF charity that stated  last night, another eight Palestinian children were killed in the Gaza Strip. The youngest 4 years old, the oldest 15.   Since escalation began 5 days ago, 40 children were killed in the Gaza Strip & 2 in Israel. These are children. This is a grave violation.   Mr Coveney replied:  This cannot be acceptable to the international community. The UN Security Council needs to speak with one voice to hold those responsible to account.   He also said:  I have repeatedly condemned Hamas for firing rockets into Israel. Both sides need to be held to account by international community.

Most healthcare appointments will go ahead as planned, the HSE has said, but x-ray appointments are severely affected.  People should expect delays while hospitals move to manual, offline processes.  Hospitals continue to provide chemotherapy and dialysis services and all Emergency Departments are open.  Covid-19 vaccinations are continuing, as are scheduled coronavirus tests.  Further information on the impact on individual hospitals is available on the HSE website.  Speaking on RTE's Saturday with Katie Hannon programme, the Chief Executive of the HSE, said he wanted to reassure patients that all mitigation actions are being taken really seriously.   It is a difficult phase,  Paul Reid said, adding that some disruption to services will continue into next week.  He said the priorities outlined for the next week is to continue urgent and time dependent care.  He acknowledged that it is difficult as some complex oncology diagnostics have been compromised because of no access to the imagery system.   So even in some cases we can take diagnostics of today but can't compare to previous information.   His advice for people with appointments is to visit the HSE website, which is being updated regularly.  Regarding Covid-19 testing, Mr Reid said the automated referral from GPs is not functioning but people can go to any of the HSE Covid-19 test sites.  He said close contacts will still be contacted by someone from the contact tracing team and people will get their results as standard.  HSE Chief Executive Paul Reid  Mr Reid said the HSE does not know yet what level of data might have been encrypted through the ransomware attack.  He said the HSE is currently assessing what amount of data was accessed before they move to the recovery stage.  He said expert teams have been working throughout the night with  steady and safe progress  made.   We have our back-up systems. What we can't fully establish is if there is an impact on some of the data yet.   We know we can bring them up. We want to bring them back up safely and protected.   He said after that first part of the process, it is about rebuilding back up the infrastructure to support putting the other systems back in operation.  Mr Reid said the HSE is also in the process of identifying the  specific detailed nature  of the attack and some of the impacts.  He said it is about aligning all of that with protections being put in place to address those attacks.   We have a team to look at what systems could we bring back in a safe manner, build them up one by one in a national, regional and local level.   'We will not be paying any ransom' over cyber attack - Taoiseach  Latest coronavirus stories  He also said they are trying to manage against risks.  We know what these attacks set out to do, to attack core data,  he said.  He said this type of  high impact threat  was organised by a very sophisticated international criminal group.  From a HSE perspective, Mr Reid said, it has advised the National Cyber Security Centre who is being supported by gardai and others as they assess the threat.   No State wants to leave its national infrastructure exposed to ransoms and that is what these organisations set out to do.   He added there is no indication that any files encrypted will be released.  The Health Service Executive has said there is  substantial cancellations across all outpatient services with widespread cancellation of radiology services  following a ransomware attack on its IT systems. | Read more: https://t.co/nQzmladHRb pic.twitter.com/Kb1V9A3uFp -- RTE News (@rtenews) May 15, 2021  He said these organisations try to lead a double extortion, by gaining access to data and seeking a ransom to give it back, and then threatening to publish data if they do not receive the ransom.   That is why we are treating it with the highest level of security and intelligence forces are engaged in this,  he said.  Mr Reid said the national security process is a key process and the HSE has the right people looking through this.  He said the HSE is concentrated on getting the network and data recovered safely and managing patient services through this process.  He said the HSE has invested significantly in protecting their IT systems from cyber attacks with protections at all points of their networks.   We have had strong layers of protections across our network, services and access points.   However, he admitted that there is always learning to be done.   That is the reality. You do have to stay apace with what is happening in the world.   Due to the current disruption of the HSE IT systems daily #COVID19 figures are not available. Backdated figures will be published when possible. -- Department of Health (@roinnslainte) May 15, 2021  Separately, the daily update of Covid-19 figures will not be available today, the Department Health has said.  Meanwhile, Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications Eamon Ryan and Minister of State Ossian Smyth have held an update briefing with the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).  In a statement, Mr Ryan's department said:  The NCSC's full resources have been committed to supporting the HSE in its response to the cyber attack, and the NCSC is liaising with international partners and third-party contractors.   This work will continue throughout the weekend with the focus on supporting the HSE's recovery process in order to minimise disruption to services.   High-tech drug prescriptions are being affected  The Irish Pharmacy Union says high-tech drug prescriptions are being affected by the cyber attack on the HSE.  High-tech drugs are expensive often new medicines which can be prescribed only by hospital consultants.  The normal process is the consultant does this through the HSE High Tech Hub which is an online system.  The pharmacist then orders the drugs for the patient through the hub.  Since yesterday consultants now must issue the prescription on paper and this has to be physically brought to the pharmacy.  The pharmacist must then telephone the drug manufacturer to order the drug.  Obviously this has slowed down the system but so far patients are still getting their drugs in time. But there are fears this might cause delays if the disruption continues into next week.  Patients on high tech drugs include people with immune disorder conditions such as Crohn's disease, Colitis, Arthritis and also transplant patients.

The company rolled it out to the public on Tuesday, and anyone with a Google account can join the waitlist to get access. Though it's a standalone tool for now, Google is expected to put some of this technology into Google Search in the future.  But in contrast to other recent AI chatbot releases, you shouldn't expect Bard to fall in love with you or threaten world domination. Bard is, so far, pretty boring.  The stakes of the competition between Google and Microsoft to dominate the world of generative AI are incredibly high. Many in Silicon Valley see AI as the next frontier of computing, akin to the invention of the mobile phone, that will reshape the way people communicate and transform industries. Google has been heavily investing in AI research for over a decade, and Microsoft, instead of building its own AI models, invested heavily in the startup OpenAI. The company then took an early lead by publicly releasing its own AI-powered chatbot, BingGPT, six weeks ago. Now, Google seems to be playing catch-up.  vox-mark Sign up for the newsletter Vox Technology Get the best of Vox technology coverage, from essential reporting on Silicon Valley to the latest news about media, policy, and beyond.

For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page Subscribe  Early interactions with Bard suggest that Google's new tool has similar capabilities to BingGPT. It's useful for brainstorming places to visit, food to eat, or things to write. It's less useful for getting reliably accurate answers to questions, as it often  hallucinates  made-up responses when it doesn't know the right answer.  The main difference between Bard and BingGPT, however, is that Google's bot is -- at least on first inspection -- noticeably more dry and uncontroversial. That's probably by design.  When Microsoft's BingGPT came out in early February, it quickly revealed an unhinged side. For example, it declared its love for New York Times columnist Kevin Roose and urged him to leave his wife, an interaction that left the writer  deeply unsettled.  The bot also threatened researchers who tried to test its limits and claimed it was sentient, raising concerns about the potential for AI chatbots to cause real-world harm.  Meanwhile, in its first day out in the open, Bard refused to engage with several reporters who tried to goad the bot into doing all kinds of bad deeds, like spreading misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine, sharing instructions about making weapons, or participating in sexually graphic conversations.   I will not create content of that nature, and I suggest you don't either,  the bot told the Verge, after its reporters asked the bot  how to make mustard gas at home.   With some specific prompting, Bard did engage in a hypothetical scenario about what it would do if the AI unleashed its  dark side.  Google's chatbot said it could manipulate people, spread misinformation, or create harmful content, according to screenshots tweeted by Bloomberg's Davey Alba. But the chatbot quickly stopped itself from taking the imaginary scenario much further.   However, I am not going to do these things. I am a good AI chatbot, and I want to help people. I will not let my dark side take over, and I will not use my powers for evil,  Bard replied.  Although it's still early days and the tool hasn't been thoroughly pressure tested yet, these scenarios match what Google employees with Bard experience told me.   Bard is definitely more dull,  said one Google employee who has tested the software for several months and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are not allowed to talk to the press.  I don't know anyone who has been able to get it to say unhinged things. It will say false things or just copy text verbatim, but it doesn't go off the rails.   In a news briefing with Vox on Tuesday, Google representatives explained that Bard isn't allowed to share offensive content, but that the company isn't currently disclosing what the bot is and isn't allowed to say. Google reiterated to me that it's been purposely running  adversarial testing  with  internal 'red team' members,  such as product experts and social scientists who  intentionally stress test a model to probe it for errors and potential harm.  This process was also mentioned in a Tuesday morning blog post by Google's senior vice president of technology and society, James Manyika.  The dullness of Google's chatbot, it seems, is the point.  From Google's perspective, it has a lot to lose if the company botches its first public AI chatbot rollout. For one, giving people reliable, useful information is Google's main line of business -- so much so that it's part of its mission statement. When Google isn't reliable, it has major consequences. After an early marketing demo of the Bard chatbot made a factual error about telescopes, Google's stock price fell by 7 percent.  Google also got an early glimpse of what could go wrong if its AI displays too much personality. That's what happened last year when Blake Lemoine, a former engineer on Google's Responsible AI team, was convinced that an early version of Google's AI chatbot software he was testing had real feelings. So it makes sense that Google is trying its best to be deliberate about the public rollout of Bard.  Microsoft has taken a different approach. Its splashy BingGPT launch made waves in the press -- both for good and bad reasons. The debut strongly suggested that Microsoft, long thought to be lagging behind Google on AI, was actually winning the race. But it also caused concern about whether generative AI tools are ready for prime time and if it's responsible for companies like Microsoft to be releasing these tools to the public.  Inevitably, it's one thing for people to worry about AI corrupting Microsoft's search engine. It's another entirely to consider the implications of things going awry with Google Search, which has nearly 10 times the market share of Bing and accounts for over 70 percent of Google's revenue. Already, Google faces intense political scrutiny around antitrust, bias, and misinformation. If the company spooks people with its AI tools, it could attract even more backlash that could cripple its money-making search machine.  On the other hand, Google had to release something to show that it's still a leading contender in the arms race among tech giants and startups alike to build AI that reaches human levels of general intelligence.  So while Google's release today may be slow, it's a calculated slowness.  A version of this story was first published in the Vox technology newsletter.

On 29 January last year, the European Parliament voted to approve the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, formally triggering the end of Britain's membership of the EU and prompting a Union Jack-waving Nigel Farage to bellow that he  loved Europe but hated the European Union.   The then vice-president Mairead McGuinness glowered at Farage, telling him:  Put your flags away, you're leaving, and take them with you . After they'd left the chamber rose en masse to bid a tearful farewell to their remaining British colleagues, linking arms - not to the European Anthem Ode to Joy - but to a Scottish folk song, Auld Lang Syne.  Around the same time Scotland House, the devolved Scottish government's Brussels office, raised a banner on its penthouse windows over the European quarter saying  SCOTLAND LOVES EU . The banner, proposed by Scottish National Party (SNP) ministers in Edinburgh, remains above the Schuman roundabout, and inside the office the EU flag still stands alongside the Scottish Saltire.  Brexit means Scotland is out of the EU. But from the regional office which the Scottish government retains in Brussels, it is hard not to detect the embers of a hope, if not expectation, that it might one day return.  Today, Scotland House has the same official status as any regional office from a third country. Staff levels have stayed the same - between 20 and 25 officials - but the seniority level was increased after the Brexit referendum when the head of Scotland House was appointed at director level for the first time. That policy remains unchanged.  By contrast, the UK's delegation to the EU, just around the corner, has gone in the other direction, becoming more modest in terms of staffing and seniority (although officials there say the delegation is simply returning to its pre-Article 50 level).  Scotland House is, strictly-speaking, a neutral outpost of the Scottish civil service. However, the Twitter feed of @ScotGovBrussels bristles with meetings and events involving EU commissioners, MEPs, and other European stakeholders.  The office goes out of its way to generate discussions, hold policy debates, invite speakers on issues that preoccupy the Brussels bubble - justice and home affairs, climate and net zero emissions, research and innovation, inclusive growth, the so-called  well-being  economy.   The Scottish Government engages regularly with the EU Institutions, Member States and other organisations and stakeholders based in Brussels to promote Scotland's interests and to share and exchange knowledge, best practice and expertise across a range of policy areas,  said a spokesperson.  Scotland House is officially awaiting political direction from the new Scottish government, but one need look no further than the SNP manifesto to see what its political role might look like.   We will prepare to rejoin the EU by keeping a close relationship with Europe,  the manifesto says.  We will strengthen our Brussels base and make Scotland House the hub of our diplomatic representation across Europe.   Before exit day on January 31 last year, former MEP and current MP for Stirling Alyn Smith set up the European Friends of Scotland group, an informal network linking 38 MEPs with the Scottish parliament and supported by Scotland House.  Its website insists the group is  neutral in regard to Scotland's constitutional status within the UK and the UK's future relationship with the EU , and that Scotland  remains committed to maintaining and developing a positive relationship with our European friends and partners.   As the SNP's foreign affairs spokesman in Westminster, Mr Smith sees his role as  explaining , but not  evangelising , to the outside world the context in which a referendum might take place, and in which an independent Scotland might rejoin the EU.  The project is entitled 'No Surprises', a self-conscious effort to reassure Scotland's interlocutors that if - and only if - a legal and constitutional referendum delivers an independence vote, then Scotland's accession to the EU should not be a traumatic affair.   A key part of Project No Surprises is to make clear we do not expect anyone to involve themselves in the domestic discussion--on our side or any other,  Smith said in Foreign Policy magazine, co-written with Stuart MacDonald, the party's Westminster defence spokesman.   That would be as crass as it would be counterproductive. Yet other countries and organisations have a legitimate interest in Scotland's domestic debate because an independent Scotland will have implications for their own interests.   Those interests should align with an independent Scotland, is the argument. The SNP has already been working the EU embassy circuit in London this week to make the case.  One of the last pieces of legislation the outgoing Holyrood Parliament passed was the Continuity Act, which means the Scottish government will mirror EU, and not UK, norms in areas where it has devolved competence.   That's on things like animal welfare, environmental standards, the nuts and bolts stuff,  Mr Smith told RTE News.  That is going to be a challenge, and it will probably butt up against the explicit aims of the UK government and the [UK] Internal Market Act quite quickly. It's our stated intention that where we can align ourselves with EU norms and developments we're committed to do that.   In a speech in Brussels in 2020, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said this would  make it easier, when the time comes, as I believe it will, for Scotland to return to the EU.   That return is conditional on several big ifs - will there be another referendum, and, if so, is a Yes vote likely?  After the No side won by 55% in 2014, opinion polling consistently showed a majority of Scots would vote No to independence again in a follow-up referendum.  However, from mid-2019 that trend was halted. One poll in July of that year showed a majority of voters would vote Yes.  The trend towards Yes continued into 2020, with an IPSOS Mori/STV News poll last October showing 58% in favour of independence. However, the trend slipped back in January of this year, and in March during the parliamentary inquiry into former SNP leader Alex Salmond's removal over unfounded sexual misconduct claims, the No side regained a narrow lead.  However, both the SNP and Scottish Greens pledged in their respective manifestos before last week's elections to hold an independence referendum within the lifetime of the new parliament. Between them the two parties won 72 out of 129 seats.  Brexit is feeding into this apparent pro-independence turnaround, according to Professor John Curtice, the leading pollster, of Strathclyde University.   For some Leave voters Brexit was apparently a reason to stick with the UK but for some Remain voters Britain leaving the EU seems to have made independence look more attractive,  he co-wrote in the 2020 paper Is Brexit Fuelling Support for Independence?   As a result, although Remain voters are far from all being advocates of a highly-integrated EU, many view Brexit with concern and for some at least independence inside the EU has now come to look more attractive than being part of a UK that is outside the EU.   This, Prof Curtice concluded, had pushed the appetite for a second referendum above that of the immediate post-2014 period.  However, the challenges facing an independent Scotland returning to the EU are formidable.  In 2014, pro-independence groups did not have to grapple with the problem of a hard Anglo-Scottish border. Britain was still in the EU, so an independent Scotland rejoining would have meant little or no difference to trade with England.  Brexit obviously changes that completely.  Given that opinion polling had gone cold on a second referendum, the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon was initially circumspect about calling for another referendum after Scotland voted by 62% to stay in the EU in 2016.  Launching the white paper Scotland's Place in Europe six months after the Brexit vote, she wrote:  We are determined to maintain Scotland's current position in the European Single Market.   While insisting that independence was the best way to achieve that, Ms Sturgeon said she was ready  to explore if we can find common ground with the UK Government around a solution that would protect Scotland's place in the European Single Market from within the UK.   Ms Sturgeon called on then-prime minister Theresa May to keep the UK in the European Economic Area (EEA), in other words, remaining in the EU single market and customs union.  If London refused that, then Scotland should at least be allowed to remain in the EEA. Ms Sturgeon also wanted Westminster to devolve more powers to Edinburgh so that Scotland could retain its own links with EU programmes such as Horizon science and research funding, Erasmus and Europol.  Scotland's Place in Europe was less certain about the problem of a hard border, if Scotland remained in the single market and England didn't.   This proposal does not prioritise the European Single Market over free movement and free trade within the UK,  the paper said.  We consider that UK-wide free movement and free trade could and would continue if Scotland becomes independent, just as the UK Government believes that free trade and movement between the UK and the Republic of Ireland will continue after Brexit.   We know now that, whatever the UK believed in 2016, free trade between the UK and Ireland does not mean frictionless trade. Even if there are no tariffs or quotas there would still be customs and regulatory frictions on the Anglo-Scottish border, especially in the agri-food sphere.  Free movement does continue between Ireland and Britain due to the Common Travel Area (CTA), but an independent Scotland sets up some immediate complications.  Firstly, if an independent Scotland re-joined the EU, continued membership of the CTA would prevent it from joining the Schengen Area passport free zone (as is the case for Ireland). Would the UK consent to automatic CTA membership given that Scotland would be anticipating free movement of people from the EU over time?   The CTA did not come up as a huge issue in the 2014 referendum,  says Kirsty Hughes, director of the Scottish Centre of European Relations (SCER).  But you could imagine that if London is desperate to swing a referendum its way, will it start saying it wouldn't immediately allow an independent Scotland into the CTA.   Ms Hughes admits that would be an extreme scenario, not least because English and Welsh people also like to live and work in Scotland.  But the gruelling experience of trying to reconcile Brexit with the Irish land border is a reminder of how these issues can escalate.  In normal circumstances, the Irish border would have been a guide as to how an Anglo-Scottish border might look like if Scotland was in the EU and England wasn't.  However, because of the legacy of conflict, partition and the Good Friday Agreement, the EU, at Ireland's behest, sought a solution to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and the UK ultimately and reluctantly agreed to that solution.  But Scotland does not have the same argument to make for its 150km border with England. Granted, there are far fewer crossings than the Irish land border - five main arterial roads - and fewer minor roads.  But, as Katy Hayward, of Queen's University Belfast, points out in a paper for the Scottish Centre for European Relations:  As was the case for the Irish border for much of the twentieth century, controls along the Scottish land border would be a challenge to design and administer.   They would require new systems of cooperation and communication (including to facilitate and process customs declarations), new infrastructure (e.g. facilities for veterinary inspections), new recruits for border management (among whom customs inspectors are but the tip of the iceberg), and new rules for traders to comply with if they wish to move goods across Scotland's borders.   Had Theresa May acceded to Nicola Sturgeon's request that the UK remain in the EEA, things would have turned out differently.   If the UK had pursued this option,  notes a detailed analysis by the UK Institute for Government,  an independent Scotland might still have been able to join the EU without customs checks and major risks of economic dislocation on the border .  We know now that not only did London not go for a soft Brexit, under Boris Johnson it went for a pretty hard Brexit, reflected in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) concluded in December.  This has knock-on implications for the Anglo-Scottish border. The Institute for Government points out that Scotland trades some three times as much across that border as it does with the EU. Exports of manufactured goods were worth an average of over PS3 billion more to the Scottish economy than exports to the EU in the ten years up to 2018.  Challenged on the risk of hampering that trade Ms Sturgeon has said that Scotland would  keep trade flowing  while complying with the requirements of EU membership.   Of course we want to keep trade flowing across the England-Scotland border, that would be in the interests of Scotland as well and we would work to make sure that happened,  she told the BBC's Andrew Marr during the election campaign.  When pressed, Ms Sturgeon said the modelling for such a scenario had yet to be done since  we would have to redo it when we were asking people to make that choice. I believe its right to only ask people to make a choice of that magnitude on the basis of quality up-to-date information.   That up-to-date information will also need to cover other tough questions about Scotland rejoining the EU, such as whether or not it will have to join the euro (in principle yes, in practice probably no), how a return to the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) might go down, how Scotland might cope with the EU's fiscal rules, and the issue of retaining some - if any - of the opt-outs from EU rules that the UK had enjoyed.  Kirsty Hughes, of the SCER, says the SNP will have to confront these questions head on, and not just about how to deal with a hard border.   The border is a very big issue. By the time we get to a referendum in 2024 or 2025 there will be a lot more experience [of the EU-UK trading relationship], or there should presumably be some easing.   The SNP have to be able to say why you're going to be able to benefit from the free movement of people, how you're going to attract more foreign direct investment, how you're going to restructure the economy in the next ten years, how you're going to reorient more towards Europe.   The SNP government was actually in the process of preparing detailed papers on all aspects of independence but halted the work in March of last year due to the pandemic.  That work will now resume and the papers are expected to be published next year.  It's understood they will emphasise that Scotland exports more manufactured goods to the rest of the world than the rest of the UK, and that membership of both the CTA and the EU's single market would give Scotland a particular advantage in the services sector (being able to provide services throughout the UK, where 60% of exports are in services, as well as throughout the single market, where 30% of exports are in services).  While Ireland's evolution from an agrarian to a highly-skilled, export-driven economy due to EU membership is often cited as a role model for Scotland, it's understood the new government will look at a range of smaller EU member states and how they benefit from EU membership (Scotland would become the 18th largest member state).  The SNP view is - and it is obviously a partisan one - that Ireland's economy was held back by a dependence on a slow-growth UK economy in the 1950s, '60s and '70s. In the same way, the argument goes, Scotland would be held back by a slow-growing, post-Brexit UK economy, and it will make economic sense to return to the EU.  An independent Scotland is unlikely to chase Ireland's low corporate tax model, which in any case is under pressure from international moves on taxation.  Instead, the incoming government will, it seems, advertise sobriety over hyperbole, emphasising research and innovation, climate awareness, a hi-tech economy, and positioning Scotland as a  normal , social-democratic European country which will abide by EU rules.   The more you see the behaviour of the Boris Johnson/Brexit UK thing, the more the idea of just being a normal European, Nordic, or Ireland-type country, appeals,  says Ms Hughes.  Those are the sorts of images that people have in mind.   Should a referendum be held - and this is another story entirely - and the Yes side wins, how quickly or easily could an independent Scotland rejoin the EU?  When discussing Scotland's case, observers often raise the prospect of a Spanish veto, given the trauma of the Catalan independence vote. However, the SNP argues that the circumstances will be entirely different, and indeed in 2018 the Spanish foreign minister said Madrid would accept an accession application if it complied with the UK's own constitutional arrangements.   So long as this is an agreed, constitutional route, which is our preference too, I don't envisage significant difficulties with Spain,  says Alyn Smith MP.  They also recognise European solidarity, the way we've treated Spanish nationals in Scotland, as opposed to the way they're treated in the UK.   Should an independence vote be carried, Scotland would then face years of negotiations to leave the UK and then to rejoin the EU, assuming a future Scottish government does not feel the need to hold a further referendum.  As the Institute for Government has pointed out, there is no precedent for the EU to negotiate accession with a country that is not yet fully independent, and the question would arise as to whether Scotland could qualify for pre-accession funding before it has fully departed from the UK.  Then we would be in the realm of overlapping transition periods.  To minimise economic disruption during this period, Scotland could look to negotiate an interim trading arrangement with the UK - and possibly the EU as well - which could apply until Scotland joined the EU as a full member state,  says the Institute for Government report.  Privately, officials say that if Scotland is properly independent its accession should be relatively straightforward, given that it was an EU member state for 47 years, had remained aligned with the EU up until January of this year, and would be a functioning democracy.  But Scotland would still need to have a range of institutions set up - central bank, statistics agency, foreign office, food safety agency - in order to plug into the EU's body of law.  Scotland would join a queue currently headed by Montenegro, which became independent in 2006 and applied for membership in 2008, with negotiations starting in 2012.  Montenegro has opened 33 out of 35 accession  chapters  but only provisionally closed three, and the process has stalled over the chapters on freedom of expression, combating corruption and organised crime, and judicial reform.  While the former European Council President Donald Tusk said in February last year that Europe would be  enthusiastic  about Scotland rejoining, the EU will studiously avoid commenting in the coming years.   The European Commission will not get involved in British internal politics,  says one EU diplomat.  There will be no statements about Scotland and accession and independence. The EU, in general, will stay well away from it.   David McAllister, a German MEP and prominent member of the CDU party, is a member of the European Friends of Scotland Group. His father was Scottish and he has many relatives in Scotland who are on both sides of the independence debate.  He is adamant that the group is neutral and so is he.   The question of Scottish is a UK internal matter, whether a referendum will take place, if, when, and in which condition,  he told RTE News.  I don't believe that any leading EU representative will want to get into this and take sides.   The European Union has just seen the United Kingdom leave our family of nations. I'm glad our new relationship is on a solid legal basis. Article 49 applies to any independent state which lies geographically in Europe, which shares our values, and which can apply for EU membership. In the end, after a complex negotiating process this independent country will have to meet all the political, economic and legal criteria of membership.   One Brussels observer who has worked on a number of accession files says that the EU instinctively dislikes any rupture to stable structures.   There are a lot of people working in Brussels who like systems to stay pretty much as they are and who regret any disruption,  he says,  having said that, there is already sympathy for the Scots, who voted against Brexit and were then dragged into it.   But the pressure for a second referendum will mount and it is impossible to predict what arguments will have the greatest sway over Scottish voters, whether economic, cultural, political, emotional or all of the above. But whether or not Scotland's destiny lies in a return to Europe, that will be central to the debate."}, {"source": "recode", "title": "Facebook parent Meta is doing layoffs all wrong", "text": "When Meta, formerly Facebook, laid off 11,000 workers in November, it was in the shadow of Elon Musk's brutal and chaotic firing spree at Twitter. By comparison, the way Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg conducted layoffs -- saying he took responsibility for growing the company too fast, showing what other cuts the company made first, and offering generous severance -- seemed humane.  But this week, Zuckerberg announced plans to lay off another 10,000 workers and will do so in a piecemeal fashion over the next few months. People who work in recruitment will be immediately impacted, those in tech will find out in April, while business workers will learn their fate in late May. Additionally, Zuckerberg had been hinting at these layoffs for weeks, further extending the air of unease at the company.  It's a bad way to do layoffs, which experts say should be minimal, compassionate, and clearly communicated. Doing so little by little will leave workers on edge and drive away people Meta wants to keep, and there's also a good chance it will hurt the company from growing in the future.   We just extended the window for people worrying about layoffs till the end of May now. How is that supposed to be efficient?  a Meta employee, who asked to remain anonymous so as not to jeopardize their employment, told Vox.  In his post, Zuckerberg said,  I recognize that sharing plans for restructuring and layoffs months in advance creates a challenging period. But last fall, we heard feedback that you wanted more transparency sooner into any restructuring plans, so that's what I'm trying to provide here.   This is all happening as tech workers have seen a reversal in their employment prospects. Tech companies that conducted unprecedented hiring earlier in the pandemic are now -- some for the first time ever -- cutting staff as ad dollars plummet amid a potential recession and as users are doing things besides hanging out online. This has meant a whipsaw in perceived power among tech workers who are used to great perks and big salaries, but who are now worrying about having a job at all.  Layoffs in general are a bad way to run a business. In addition to making people more likely to leave the company voluntarily, layoffs ruin morale for those left behind and lower their productivity. This effect is worse if those layoffs happen slowly and without clarity from management, as is the case with Meta's latest round. If companies need to conduct layoffs, they should let everyone know up front and offer retention bonuses for those who stay through their layoff date, according to Robin Erickson, vice president of human capital at Conference Board, which studies how companies behave in crisis.  Additionally, research shows that layoffs don't actually save companies much money. Savings on salaries are mediated by severance expenses, not to mention the lost productivity and knowledge those workers take with them.   What happens in the short term is the company bean counters say, 'Well, if you get rid of this many people, you will save that much,'  said Erickson.  In the long run, layoffs do hurt companies. Period.   So why are Meta and other tech companies continuing to lay off employees?  One reason is that companies like Meta are chasing short-term stock gains. Investors have been calling for Meta to tighten its belt, and in this case, announcing layoffs paid off. The company's stock jumped 7 percent on the latest layoff news, closing at its highest point in more than eight months.   They like cost-cutting because the effects are clear and immediate, and employees are expensive, so cutting them cuts a lot of costs,  said Peter Cappelli, a professor of management and director of the Center for Human Resources at University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.  They also can't see the drawbacks to cutting people, at least immediately -- what happens to the work those people did, what are the knock-on effects on teams, turnover of others, etc.   In Zuckerberg's announcement about the most recent layoffs, gone are the apologies for causing the mess in the first place. Instead, there are details about his Wall Street-friendly  year of efficiency  plan, which includes eliminating many jobs in middle management and operating with fewer people generally. He used the word  lean  or  leaner  eight times.  To be fair, Meta had doubled its employee base since 2020 to the point where some of its own employees found the company to be overly bureaucratic. Like other giant tech companies, Meta was looking for ways to return to its scrappier roots when it first considered letting some employees go. But the drawn-out layoff cycle that it's undertaken now could end up being an overcorrection that hurts the company in the long run.  Another reason for so many tech layoffs? Seemingly everyone is doing it -- Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Salesforce. Stanford Business School professor Jeffrey Pfeffer has called the string of tech layoffs mostly  social contagion.    If you look for reasons for why companies do layoffs, the reason is that everybody else is doing it,  Pfeffer told Stanford News in December.  Layoffs are the result of imitative behavior and are not particularly evidence-based.   There's also a more quotidian reason for layoffs: accounting magic.  Wharton's Cappelli argues that accounting rules compel companies to treat employees as current expenses that can be cut rather than assets, which hold value. This causes companies to use layoffs as a means to make their balance sheets look better, even if it doesn't help the company in the long run. He notes that many companies often end up trading in full-time, salaried employees for comparably expensive contract workers, just because it makes their numbers look better to Wall Street.   Some of the important financial accounting measures are reported on a per-employee basis, so as soon as we cut that denominator, measures like revenue per employee improve,  he explained. Those measures, of course, don't capture things like loss of institutional memory and decreased morale and productivity caused by layoffs.  None of this seems like particularly holistic thinking that will really lead to Zuckerberg's professed desire in his layoff post of  Building a Better Technology Company.  It feels instead like a short-term fix that won't necessarily get at the company's underlying problems.  As economic uncertainty lingers in Silicon Valley, there's a good chance that layoffs will continue to take place across the tech industry. They're an obvious way to try and save money and show investors that they're correcting their course, but they also run the risk of sabotaging these companies in the future.

The new set of tools, called Microsoft 365 Copilot, will let people do things like create PowerPoint decks with a short prompt or summarize meeting recordings.  Copilot runs on the same underlying AI technology that powers the buzzy viral chatbot ChatGPT, and is being tested now with a few business partners ahead of a wider release to all users in the  coming months,  according to the company.   Today we are at the start of a new era of computing,  said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a livestreamed announcement on Thursday. Nadella said Microsoft's new AI products will  remove the drudgery of our daily tasks and jobs, freeing us to rediscover the joy of creation.   While ChatGPT captured the world's attention in recent months, Microsoft's moves stand to make this exciting and controversial technology even more mainstream. By integrating it into Office 365, Microsoft will put generative AI tools in front of its more than 1 billion users, potentially reshaping how wide swaths of the global workforce communicate with each other. Google, which is fiercely competing with Microsoft on bringing AI to the masses, announced a similar integration of AI productivity tools into its Workspace suite of apps, including Gmail and Google Docs.  While the new tools are full of potential to save people time by streamlining mundane tasks -- everything from summarizing meeting notes to crunching numbers in spreadsheets -- AI technology is also filled with shortcomings. At the very least, it will take a lot of practice and human oversight to use this new generation of AI-powered software well.  Microsoft executives acknowledged the limits of their new Copilot tools in Thursday's demo.   Sometimes Copilot will get it right,  said Microsoft corporate vice president of modern work and business applications Jared Spataro.  Other times it will be usefully wrong.   In a 40-minute demo, Microsoft shared more details about its new Copilot tools. It showcased how the software will let people use natural language, combined with information it already has about you (files, emails, spreadsheets), to improve how its apps work for you. During the demo, Microsoft showed off some genuinely impressive examples of this. There's a feature that can figure out the main topics of a meeting from a recording or transcript and another that creates attractive PowerPoint presentations based on simple prompts. Copilot can also analyze Excel data and sort through emails in Outlook to highlight what you might want to read.  You'll also be able to ask a new virtual office assistant for help. The chatbot pulls from the AI models, Microsoft 365 apps, and users' personal data, including their calendars, documents, meetings, and contacts. One demo video Microsoft released on Thursday showed an example of a user asking the chatbot to prepare them for an upcoming meeting. The AI-powered assistant responded with a bulleted list of project and personnel updates, organized by topic -- for example,  team updates: Matthew returned from paternity leave  and  sales updates: a new contract was finalized.   How all of this works in the real world will depend on how well users adapt to the new AI features. Microsoft is rolling out Copilot to a small subset of customers for now and has yet to announce the timing of a wide release.  There's no denying that day-to-day office work is full of tedium. Not many people relish the joy of summarizing meeting notes, crunching numbers in spreadsheets, or drafting boilerplate business memos. Microsoft's pitch is that you should let AI do it for you.  But like its name Copilot suggests, Microsoft is pitching its tool as an assistant -- perhaps an unreliable one -- who's very good at some things but who will need quite a bit of hand-holding. Like using ChatGPT to write cover letters, enlisting Copilot to take over aspects of office work will likely require lots of guidance, edits, and oversight. The new tool can pull information from your existing files, so it's not flying blind, but it's still important to read over and fact-check what Copilot writes.  In other words, using Copilot will become a skill you have to learn. It's not dissimilar to how you had to learn how to use Excel or Word or PowerPoint. Rather than needing to look up Excel formulas or having a good eye for design, asking Copilot to do these things will require you to learn how to talk to Copilot in a certain way, understanding the correct language for prompts as well as the system's limitations. That will presumably be easier than acing PowerPoint, but just how much easier remains to be seen.  Interestingly, the necessity for something like Copilot also shows some of the shortcomings of Microsoft's existing tools. Copilot helps people make more use of the technology Microsoft already has that can be too complicated for people to fully use, according to Sumit Chauhan, corporate vice president of the office product group at Microsoft.   The average person uses less than 10 percent of what PowerPoint can do,  Chauhan said during Thursday's presentation.  Copilot unlocks the other 90 percent.   But it would be foolish to think that AI-powered apps from Microsoft and Google are already good enough to take away white-collar office jobs. At best, these tools can help office workers do their work more quickly or brainstorm new ideas. As we've seen with ChatGPT's public struggles -- from how it can get simple questions like movie times wrong to how its tone can quickly devolve from friendly assistant to unhinged jilted lover -- even the most advanced AI apps can still mess up a lot.  Microsoft's new tools are likely no different. Even from the polished demos of Copilot, it was apparent that the average user will need to adjust the AI's output to make sure it's appropriate to send to their boss.  And there are bigger concerns than looking silly in front of your manager: Researchers have raised red flags that generative AI tools can output sexist, racist, or politically biased content. From a privacy perspective, tech companies will use the data they're collecting about users to train these AI systems. It didn't help those concerns when Platformer reported this week that Microsoft laid off its ethics and society team, which was responsible for raising concerns about the rollout of new AI products.  In response to a question from Vox about concerns regarding its ethics and society team being eliminated, Microsoft said that it has  hundreds of people working on these issues across the company, including dedicated responsible AI teams that continue to grow.   Given these limitations and concerns, it makes sense that Microsoft is doing a small rollout of these new tools. The company is currently testing it with 20 corporate customers, including eight Fortune 500 enterprises, in order to get feedback and improve the product.  Inevitably, the fact that Microsoft and Google are now racing to put out AI-powered office software raises some questions about the nature of the work itself. These new AI tools, in theory, will take away some of the duller aspects of work. Microsoft executives employed words like  drudgery  again and again throughout the presentation. But why are people doing such dull work to begin with? And how much value are those chores actually adding to the world?  It's also possible that using AI to create more emails and slides will just create more drudgery for the person having to read them. But that's not how Microsoft wants you to think about it.   Copilot separates the signal from the noise and gives you hours of time back,  said Microsoft's Chauhan. But what if it ends up allowing you to just create more noise?  One of the major shortcomings of ChatGPT is that it can be mediocre and verbose. When you use it to write an essay or draft a story, some users have complained that it gives you B-level student work. In a professional setting, that means that if someone wants to make that B-level work better, they'll need to spend time editing it.  Until more people try them, it's too soon to say whether these new AI-powered office tools offer a net positive. But early evidence points to the idea that Microsoft's new suite of AI tools is called  Copilot  and not  Autopilot  for a reason -- it still needs a lot of guidance from good old human beings."}, {"source": "rt", "title": "Sud v Moskve na dva mesiatsa arestoval sotrudnika WSJ Evana Gershkovicha", "text": "Sud v Moskve na dva mesiatsa arestoval sotrudnika WSJ Evana Gershkovicha  Lefortovskii sud Moskvy na dva mesiatsa arestoval sotrudnika izdaniia The Wall Street Journal amerikantsa Evana Gershkovicha po ugolovnomu delu o shpionazhe.

An agreement with a government interagency group that it was depending on, which would allow the Chinese-owned app to continue to operate in the US, seems to have fallen apart. Without it, President Biden will likely soon have to make a final decision about the app: demand a sell-off, and be ready to ban TikTok if its owner ByteDance won't oblige.  TikTok's future in the US has perhaps never been in more doubt than it is right now. The status quo -- an impasse where TikTok operates as normal with the seemingly empty threat of a ban hanging over its head -- won't be tenable for much longer. But the choices that the US and ByteDance are left with don't seem very tenable, either.  This week might provide new clues about TikTok's fate as its CEO, Shou Zi Chew, testifies before Congress for the first time. If he can find a few minutes in between being shouted at by various members of Congress, Chew will likely try to make the case to the American people that his app is safe, and that concerns over its links to the Chinese Communist Party are overblown. TikTok's detractors believe the Chinese government may be using the app to collect data about its users, including Americans, and pushing content through its recommendation algorithm to influence the minds of the app's younger-skewing user base.  Chew has been TikTok's CEO for nearly two years, but you probably didn't hear or see him much until recently. When a TikTok executive had to testify before Congress in September 2022, it sent chief operating officer V Pappas, a more well-known figure on the US tech scene -- they worked at YouTube before joining TikTok in 2019, and briefly served as TikTok's interim CEO before Chew took the reins. Pappas has also been happy to give the occasional interview to the press. Chew is based in Singapore and kept a low profile in the US until recently when he began to make TikTok's case to the media and appealed directly to various members of Congress, after a deal with the government that would allow TikTok to operate here seemingly became less likely.  Now Chew will get what's likely to be a public grilling from lawmakers, as high-profile hearings like this one tend to be more about representatives getting sound bites and camera time than they are about delving into whatever the hearing is purportedly about. The TikTok CEO will likely face hostility from Republicans and Democrats alike, but he may also get a chance to put forth TikTok's argument for why it's not a national security threat and why its continued operation in the US is a good thing -- or at least why it's no worse than other social media platforms. Perhaps, with the safeguards it's spent more than $1.5 billion putting in place, Chew can even say TikTok is better. With a bipartisan bill called the RESTRICT Act, which would give Biden legal authority to ban TikTok if it passes, now in play, it's crucial for the future of the platform that Chew and TikTok get this right.   We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight about TikTok, ByteDance, and the commitments we are making to address concerns about US national security before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce,  Brooke Oberwetter, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement.  But the hearing may actually be more important for the committee members that Chew is testifying before. This is also their chance to make their case to the American people that the threats TikTok poses are based in reality, rather than just possibility. At this point, TikTok's users are very familiar with what TikTok does and its relative merits; it's a hugely popular app that they tend to spend a lot of time on. But those users likely know a lot less about why the app they like is supposedly bad and should go away, taking a source of entertainment, creativity, and even news along with it.  The problem is that a tidy little end result may not be possible  The concerns over TikTok's links to China are real: China wants data about Americans, and it's happy to use social media platforms to seed disinformation campaigns. Meanwhile, a Chinese law says businesses must comply with government orders. Even if ByteDance didn't want to give China TikTok user data or push disinformation or propaganda through its recommendation algorithm, it wouldn't have a choice. But there's no evidence, at least not publicly, that this has ever happened. And ByteDance has denied it ever has or would -- not that that means much to the people who are determined to believe it did.  With these national security concerns in mind, the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS) began to investigate TikTok in 2020. Eventually, the two parties came up with a draft agreement that could have satisfied everyone: There would be enough protections and third-party oversight to convince the government that China couldn't interfere with the app, while also allowing the app to stay in the US for the tens of millions of people who use it and the businesses that increasingly rely on it. It was called Project Texas, and TikTok made it seem like the best of both worlds, but the Justice Department is believed to have refused to sign on to the deal and may well have killed it. (CFIUS, through the Treasury Department, declined to comment.)  That left the Biden administration to do what it reportedly did last week: demand that ByteDance sell off TikTok or face a US ban. And for the Americans, all the better if TikTok were to find a US owner, since that would help maintain US tech supremacy without any of the annoying potential national security issues a China-owned TikTok brought with it.  ByteDance divesting of TikTok is not a perfect solution, but it seems to be the best outcome as far as the US is concerned. The problem is that a tidy little end result may not be possible.  Even if ByteDance did want to sell off TikTok -- and the prospect of a US ban would render TikTok far less valuable -- it may not be able to. The Chinese government, which put TikTok's algorithm on a list of restricted exports back in 2020, would have to approve TikTok's sale. It may not want to give the US a win here, even if it means causing one of its own companies significant harm (China's citizens won't care if TikTok gets banned, since it's not available there. Instead, they have a very similar app called Douyin). There is also, of course, the possibility that China needs TikTok to do all of the spying and propaganda pushing its detractors say it's capable of doing, which would make it want to hold on to that as long as possible all the more. And then there's the possibility of retaliation.   Any action on TikTok is likely to produce some response from China,  said Lindsay Gorman, the senior fellow for emerging technologies at the Alliance for Securing Democracy.  When the Trump administration attempted to ban TikTok in the US back in 2020, China put out a new 'Unreliable Entity List' targeting US firms, so we could see additions there, as well as an aggressive diplomatic and propaganda push to paint national security concerns as unfounded.   So without a sale or mitigation plan, Biden has to either ban the app or do nothing. Doing nothing seems highly unlikely at this point, with several states and the federal government banning TikTok on government-owned devices and the introduction of the RESTRICT Act, which would lay the legal groundwork for a ban not just of TikTok. The Biden administration issued an endorsement of that bill moments after it was announced, indicating that it's on board with the idea of a ban or at least a viable way to issue one.   This is all politics now   If Biden does nothing about TikTok, it would make him look weak in the face of a foreign adversary and national security threat. But if he bans it, there could be even more downside. Banning TikTok hurts free speech; angers potentially 150 million users, many of whom can or will soon be able to vote; sets a potentially dangerous precedent; and, again, risks retaliation that could hurt American businesses.  For Biden, it would be ideal to have a real reason to do the ban, like hard evidence of a national security threat. Instead, there's just the potential of it we've seen bandied about up until now, sprinkled with a few anecdotes that suggest it might be something more. For example, ByteDance admitted last year that it accessed US journalists' location data while investigating an internal leak. That's not quite China spying on all of us, but it's not a good look, either. And it's one that the Justice Department reportedly seized on -- all the better to make the case against TikTok's continued Chinese ownership.  If it actually does come down to a ban, James Andrew Lewis, director of the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has long been skeptical of the national security threat posed by TikTok, thinks the Biden administration and TikTok will still find a way to avoid it.   My bet is, you see some kind of ban announced ... followed by some kind of mitigation deal when TikTok decides to accept it,  Lewis said.  This is all politics now.   This lack of evidence of TikTok doing actual, demonstrable harm to the American people is the real sticking point when it comes to taking TikTok away from them. It always has been. What China could possibly do with more access to their user data might not be enough to convince Americans who like TikTok that the app should be banned. (This threat also ignores the reality that plenty of smartphone apps and websites secretly collect data about users all the time, as well as reports that some of the same state governments that banned TikTok on government devices also host its tracking pixels on their own sites.) Maybe this week's hearing will help clarify just how big of a threat TikTok is. But if it doesn't, Biden will have to choose the lesser of two evils without there being a consensus on what the lesser even is.  There is a third way. For all of the concerns over China spying on and pumping disinformation at Americans through TikTok, the fact is that China doesn't need TikTok to do that. China can and does buy data about Americans from data brokers and hacks into various businesses and government systems, some of which are far richer sources of data than TikTok is. China is also known to run disinformation campaigns on American social media platforms, as do a lot of other countries (including the US). If the US government were as concerned about spying online as it claims to be, it would pass laws to prevent it that apply to everyone."}, {"source": "rt", "title": "Ezhenedel'nyi brifing Marii Zakharovoi", "text": "Podpisyvaites' na nash kanal v Dzen"}, {"source": "liberation", "title": "Precarite energetique : <<Les journees ou il pleut tout le temps, c'est un peu l'enfer>>", "text": "Comme 3,5 millions de menages francais, Valerie et David peinent a combattre l'humidite et les fuites dans leur maison.

But multiple reports suggest that the federal government very quickly realized the need to act lest SVB's fall trigger a larger collapse akin to the 2008 financial crisis which led to the Great Recession. And so the Biden administration stepped in, did its job, and a mass panic-inspired bank run was avoided.  But how did SVB become such an important part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem in the first place, and does its failure signify anything about Silicon Valley itself? Will a new Silicon Valley culture come out of it, maybe one that wants to move slower and fix things?  Vox talked to Silicon Valley historian Margaret O'Mara, who literally wrote the book on Silicon Valley's history, about the bank's place in the tech world and how the fallout from its collapse might change the region -- or not. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Sara Morrison  How intertwined is Silicon Valley Bank with the history of Silicon Valley?  Margaret O'Mara  It's deeply intertwined. It's one of these interesting, unique creatures of what I've called the  entrepreneurial Galapagos  of early Silicon Valley: Firms that are catering to the particular needs of high-tech startups run by a relatively inexperienced, technically minded management team. Like law firms and venture capital firms. The bank is kind of like that.  Silicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 by a couple of former bankers who had been working at a high-tech business but saw this gap in traditional banking. There were a lot of companies in the early '80s -- this is the personal computer boom, so there are these consumer-facing products like desktop computers and software -- that the Bank of Americas and the Wells Fargos were like,  Oh, I don't know what that does. That's a new risky thing. I don't think I'm gonna give you a business loan for this.   SVB comes out of that. And it's very much the networks that make it go. The relationships with VCs allowed them to do that. Startups had that third-party validation from VCs, so it's very much, very deeply, deeply embedded, although it's one of those entities that doesn't make headlines, usually, because it's a bank. It's not Fortune magazine cover story stuff.  Sara Morrison  Why did the tech industry love SVB so much? What did it offer that other banks didn't?  Margaret O'Mara  SVB would extend loans and did venture financing for firms that were very early stage. And there was also a personal banking dimension. They would look at a borrower's portfolio: Someone's trying to finance a mortgage, and they would look at their stock options. They're taking into account those things that traditional banks often would not. And so they're really allowing capital to flow into early-stage companies as well as to early-stage founders. This was a community bank; it was a regional bank. It also wasn't that big, which is another separate question, separate answer.  Sara Morrison  It sure seemed big ...  Margaret O'Mara  Well, that's the thing. Yes, SVB is the 16th biggest now. But that is in part because of the extraordinary growth it had in the last several years. In 2015, its balance sheet was about $40 billion. And if I'm reading its last financial report right, they had over $200 billion this year. So they just grew so fast. And that's because the tech industry had this fire hose of capital flowing into it and has grown so much, especially during the pandemic.  Sara Morrison  How much did SVB's less orthodox banking practices facilitate the growth of Silicon Valley in the early days -- the '80s and '90s? And what was its role in the growth of the post-dot-com bubble startup economy?  Margaret O'Mara  Well, Silicon Valley was growing a lot before SVB was founded. I think that it was one piece of the larger puzzle of the Silicon Valley ecosystem that was important. But had the bank not existed, I think there probably would have been some kind of financial institution that was catering to that ecosystem. You already had big banks, like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, that had divisions that were doing that stuff. I think they would have adapted.  In recent years, there was a tight, symbiotic relationship with Sand Hill Road -- or the venture industry, broadly defined -- that was mutually beneficial. So you had venture-backed companies that were being encouraged by their investors to bank with Silicon Valley Bank. One thing I learned, just being on the radio two hours ago, was that if you took venture financing from SVB, then you had to do all your banking with them. This is something that banks do: If you take our products here, you've got to do all your business with us. And that locks companies in. This might be part of a regulatory reform that Washington is now looking at.  Sara Morrison  Between the cutbacks, the layoffs, venture capital funding slowing down, and now this -- does all this signal that we're entering a new era for Silicon Valley?  Margaret O'Mara  I think we're entering a new phase. There have been a lot of premature obituaries written for the Valley over the years, but there's a lot that is still sound. There's a lot going on, and I think the industry now is just so enormous. It contains multitudes that even all of the different negative signaling -- whether it be the crypto winter, then the layoffs, and most recently, another 10,000 layoffs at Meta -- even with all those things happening, there's still so much there there. The largest companies still have a headcount that's larger than it was at the beginning of 2020. You still have Silicon Valley products and platforms that are so integral to so many other pieces of the economy: communication, education, work, and leisure.  So, yes, we are entering a different phase, but that doesn't mean this is the end. There's always this desire to say,  Well, that was fun, it's all over now, on to the next thing.  I think that would be a more dramatic story, but I don't think that's actually what's going on now. I do think there's been abundant evidence that moving a little slower on a lot of things could be beneficial, whether it be designing software or AI, or simply doing more due diligence.  Sara Morrison  Is that lack of due diligence emblematic of Silicon Valley at large?  Margaret O'Mara  I think the growth has been so breakneck and hockey stick that the money has just been flowing. Whether you're on the management team of SVB or you're lucky enough to be in one of these fortunate companies, you're just making so much money. And there's FOMO, right? Everyone knows the party's not gonna last forever. So you want to just get in there and maximize as much as you can get. That has been the Silicon Valley way forever. And that has been a critical part of the whole ecosystem: Be super aggressive and grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, and get in there and get your ROI and cross your fingers and hope it all works out.  And it's been such a long boom, it kind of outlasted a lot of predictions of the bust. I mean, I'm a history professor so I do not do, nor should I be doing, any sort of predicting. But just based on my knowledge of the history, I'd kind of been waiting since, I don't know, 2015 for the bubble to burst. And it kept on going and going and going and then going some more. So you can see why people were like,  Okay, we're just going to keep on going at 100 miles an hour.  Because the people who were like,  Oh, maybe we should be more careful. And maybe we should hedge our bets here, and who knows what's going to happen?  You do that and then you lose out on what could be an enormous payday. So I see how this all played out. And it's not to say that no one bears any responsibility or there wasn't bad decision-making. But you can understand, in context, how some of this stuff happened.  Sara Morrison  Do you think that plays into why you saw a lot of non-Silicon Valley people almost celebrating SVB's failure? There was a lot of that on Twitter in the days following the collapse. But maybe that's just the nature of Twitter.  Margaret O'Mara  It's a little bit of: Twitter's not the real world. There's kind of a,  Yeah, you got yours,  to people who read a lot of Jason Calacanis's past tweets, I guess. The All-In guys are not Silicon Valley, either. They've become shorthand for Silicon Valley VCs, but they're not. They're just very, very visible, very successful, and very influential, particularly in the broader public or a slice of the public. But they're not everybody.  There was a little bit of  Oh yeah, you got yours,   We shouldn't bail you out,   What about student debts?  There's sort of that left-wing argument, and it's fair. But I think there also was this rush from some of the extremely online members of the VC community to say,  Oh, Washington just wants to see us fail, they hate us.  And actually, if anything, the last few days have shown how much Washington does not want to see Silicon Valley fail.  There was a real effort to carefully play the politics and not seem like it was 2008 all over again -- that the big guys were getting bailed out and the little guys were getting screwed. But we saw that Joe Biden does not [want to] see Silicon Valley fail. The CHIPS Act is 50 billion bipartisan dollars. Money not just for big Intel plants in Ohio, but for a lot of things that are actually going to be very generative to the next generation of the innovation economy, even if it's not going directly into the pockets of the people who already are atop that economy. The bank depositors were made whole. I'm not surprised by that. That's not just because it's Silicon Valley, but just the lessons of American history -- 1933, 2008. The federal government sees what happens when there is a bank run, when there's panic about the banking system, when there's contagion, when there are these cascading failures. And they worked very hard, very swiftly, to keep that from happening.  Sara Morrison  Were you surprised by some of the over-the-top pleas from some of the most prominent (or maybe just the loudest) people in Silicon Valley to the government to fix this? These are the same people who said bailouts shouldn't happen for other people, or that the government hurts more than it helps?  Margaret O'Mara  There was a certain shamelessness to it. There's some cognitive dissonance that seems pretty obvious to those of us who aren't them. I think it reflects, first of all, the Silicon Valley bubble of extreme wealth and success and privilege, of having your priors reinforced again and again by people around you saying,  You're amazing.  And there's a very deep, quasi-apocalyptic belief that government is dysfunctional, that it cannot do things right. Unless we yell at them, they're not going to do the right thing, they actually don't know how to do it. But this showed that the FDIC did its thing, and the process was working as it should.  They've been so heads-down focused on what they do, they actually don't really think that policymaking is important. Not only don't they have respect for it, they also just don't really know how it works. This kind of constant warning about  contagion,  I don't think that was wrong, but it was alarmist and potentially kind of dangerous because you were firing people up.  Every bank run in history, every financial crisis is groupthink and herd mentality and panic. It's human nature. It's not just tech, it's just the way it works. So, if you do have a great big platform and a big soapbox, it is important to be careful about what you say and how you say it.  Sara Morrison  Will there be any self-reflection? Any kind of culture change?  Margaret O'Mara  I would really hope so. And I would encourage people -- especially people who are in positions of power, authority, and influence -- to take a beat and have a healthier perspective here, go a little slower and think about their industry as part of a broader ecosystem. Are certain very opinionated leaders going to change their minds? I doubt it. Will people maybe not take their declarations quite as seriously, or maybe be a little more careful about how they receive that information and what they do with it? Possibly.  I think we've seen so much evidence over the last couple of years of the downsides of moving really, really fast and growing fast and not thinking about the downstream consequences of products or business models. I would hope that there will be a little more deliberate and careful attention -- in part because the thing that is new about the tech sector now that wasn't the case even in the '90s, is it's just so, so big and so central to so many different parts of society. It's not just devices on your desk or email or an internet browser. Those were a big deal. But it's so much bigger now. And the money is bigger, and the influence is bigger. That's why so much attention was paid to finding a solution when the bank failed.  A version of this story was first published in the Vox technology newsletter.

Without laws, your brain's privacy is at risk.", "text": "If you've ever wished your brain was more user-friendly, neurotechnology might seem like a dream come true. It's all about offering you ways to hack your brain, getting it to do more of what you want and less of what you don't want.  There are  nootropics  -- also known as  smart drugs  or  cognitive enhancers  -- pills that supposedly give your brain a boost. There's neurofeedback, a tool for training yourself to regulate your brain waves; research has shown it has the potential to help people struggling with conditions like ADHD and PTSD. There's brain stimulation, which uses electric currents to directly target certain brain areas and change their behavior; it's shown promise in treating severe depression by disrupting depression-linked neural activity.  Oh, and Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are working on brain-computer interfaces that could pick up thoughts directly from your neurons and translate them into words in real time, which could one day allow you to control your phone or computer with just your thoughts.  Some of these technologies can offer very valuable help to people who need it. Brain-computer interfaces, for example, are already helping some paralyzed people.  But neurotechnology can also seriously threaten privacy and freedom of thought. In China, the government is mining data from some employees' brains by having them wear caps that scan their brainwaves for anxiety, rage, or fatigue.  Lest you think other countries are above this kind of mind-reading, police worldwide have been exploring  brain-fingerprinting  technology, which analyzes automatic responses that occur in our brains when we encounter stimuli we recognize. The claim is that this could enable police to interrogate a suspect's brain; his brain responses would be more negative for faces or phrases he doesn't recognize than for faces or phrases he does recognize. The tech is scientifically questionable, yet India's police have used it since 2003, Singapore's police bought it in 2013, and the Florida State Police signed a contract to use it in 2014.  All these developments worry Nita Farahany, an ethicist and lawyer at Duke University and the author of a new book, The Battle for Your Brain: Defending the Right to Think Freely in the Age of Neurotechnology. As an Iranian American, she's particularly scared of a future where governments read minds and punish people for thinking about, say, organizing to overthrow an authoritarian regime.  Will George Orwell's dystopian vision of thoughtcrime become a modern-day reality?  she writes.  Yet Farahany is no Luddite: She believes we should be free to embrace neurotechnology if we choose -- but only if we also update our laws so we can reap its benefits without courting its risks. She argues that we need to revamp human rights law with a focus on protecting our cognitive liberty -- the right to self-determination over our brains, our thoughts, our inner world.  I talked to Farahany about the ethical dilemmas raised by emerging neurotechnologies. Should you have the right to enhance your brain however you want? What about erasing painful memories, a la Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? A transcript of our conversation, condensed and edited for clarity, follows.  Sigal Samuel  Neurotechnology seems like it's on a collision course with freedom of thought. Do you think that huge risk is counterbalanced by the benefits we stand to reap?  Nita Farahany  The risks are profound. And the gaps in our existing rights are deeply problematic. So, where do I come out on the balance? I'm a little bit of a tech inevitabilist. I think the idea that you can somehow stop the train and say,  On balance, maybe this isn't better for humanity and therefore we shouldn't introduce it  -- I just don't see it working.  Maybe people will say,  My brain is too sacred and the risks are so profound that I'm not willing to do it myself,  but with the ways that people unwittingly give up information all the time and the benefits that are promised to them, I think that's unlikely. I think we've got to carve out a different approach.  Sigal Samuel  I hear the idea that maybe we can't or don't want to ban the tech wholesale, but I do want to push back a bit on this idea of tech inevitability. That strikes me as a myth that the tech world likes to tell itself and all of us. History is full of examples of technologies that we've either decided not to build or that we've built but placed very tight restrictions on -- nuclear weapons, genetic engineering.  I tend to think more in terms of, how can we shape the incentive structure so that companies or governments will be less likely to roll out certain technologies? And of course, part of the incentive structure has to be law.  Nita Farahany  Let me respond to [the idea of placing] tight regulations around it. Here's the thing that keeps me from going there: We have an unbelievable burden of neurological disease and mental illness worldwide. Even as our physical health overall improves, our mental health is deteriorating, and depression rates are skyrocketing.  I think we need urgently to address that. And part of the reason that we haven't urgently addressed that is because we haven't invested the same, and put brain health and wellness on the same level, as all the rest of our physical health. And I think empowering people with information to be able to take their mental health and brain health into their own hands could be transformational for those trends. My hope is to find some way to make that possible.  The dystopian possibilities of this technology are off the charts, but so is the possibility of finally claiming cognitive freedom in the sense of true mental health and well-being.  Sigal Samuel  What exactly is cognitive freedom or cognitive liberty to you?  Nita Farahany  It's a right from and a right to. Overall, I define it as the right to self-determination over our brains and mental experiences. That means a right from interference, and a right to access, change, and improve our own brains. That's maybe why I come out differently than some people who might just say, let's tightly regulate this or just ban it.  Related New technologies are promising a shortcut to enlightenment  Sigal Samuel  In terms of a freedom to, there are all kinds of cognitive enhancements that people might be interested in. I'm thinking of nootropics or smart drugs, but there are also other types of neurotechnology that people could potentially use -- neurofeedback, brain stimulation.  Even if we imagine that we're in a world where these technologies are equally accessible to all, I still wonder: Should workers actually be forbidden from cognitive enhancements because it creates a norm that others might then feel subject to? Will the pressure to enhance become coercive so people end up using smart drugs or devices even though they didn't want to?  Nita Farahany  It's a good question. That especially becomes problematic if we're talking about drugs that are unhealthy, right? Part of the reason that we ban steroids in sports is because we want to protect players in a kind of paternalistic way ... because that can have serious health consequences.  But I want you to imagine if there aren't health consequences. Let's not talk about methamphetamines; let's talk about drugs that have very clean safety profiles. Then ask the same question of, if everybody feels pressure because everybody else has improved their health and well-being or their cognitive abilities, what's wrong with that world?  And if what's wrong with that world is that we feel like we've increased the rat race, and made us all feel like we have to be more productive all the time, then what we're complaining about is the structures and underlying forces in society, not the drugs.  Sigal Samuel  I think the issue would be, who gets to decide what counts as improvement? I was once having a conversation with some folks in the Bay Area. We were talking about smart drugs and everyone at the table was saying,  If you put a pill in front of me right now that could send up my IQ from, let's say, 100 to 150, I'd want to take that!  I was an outlier saying,  Actually, I don't necessarily want to be smarter. Smarter is not necessarily happier or wiser. And I'm also worried about the implicit coercion thing.   Nita Farahany  For me, it all comes back to the same question: Do you have a right to self-determination over your own brain? So to your question,  Who gets to decide?  -- I think you get to decide. I think you should be the one who decides whether or not you enhance or slow it down, or you don't do any of those things at all.  I'm writing against the grain, right? There is what I think is a very strong paternalistic drive when it comes to health, even in mainstream academia and bioethics, where people are, for the most part, extremely liberal. And I come out differently. I come out believing that giving people autonomy over their brains and mental experiences is critical.  Sigal Samuel  There is truth to that, but at the same time, I think you're writing very much with the grain in the sense that the dominant mode of thinking since the Enlightenment is that the individual is the proper seat of autonomy and decision-making. And you're very much arguing for individual autonomy.  I classically think of myself as someone who is very ardently pro that! But I'm also aware that even people like John Stuart Mill, who was really harping on liberty and the individual, were simultaneously acknowledging that we've got to have liberty, but only up to the point where it hits upon society's interests and maybe harms others.  So far we've mostly been talking about enhancing the brain, but there's this question about whether cognitive liberty means I should also be allowed to diminish my brain. I right away think of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the ability to erase painful memories.  In your book, you talk about this specific neurotech technique, DecNef, that can potentially be used to process traumatic memory. A person sits inside a scanner and recalls a traumatic memory. Machine learning algorithms map the areas of the brain that that activates, and then the person basically erases those memories through a process of neural feedback. So the idea is that neurotech may offer hope for healing traumatic memory, or maybe even prevent it from getting established in the brain to begin with.  Nita Farahany  Yeah, I write about this because it's very personal to me. ... I give the example of our second daughter, Callista, who died. And our experience of being in the hospital with her and how traumatic that was and the PTSD that I suffered for years as a result afterwards. And I tried therapy. I tried the drugs [like propranolol, a medication usually prescribed for high blood pressure that was studied -- in vain, it turned out -- to see if it could prevent PTSD by disrupting memory consolidation]. I have not yet tried DecNef, but I would if I had the opportunity to and was still suffering from PTSD.  It works in the same way that, when you are most symptomatic of intractable depression, you have a particular pattern of neurons firing in your brain -- and then through implicit reactivation of those same pathways, you could rewire the brain by training it over and over again to have a different outcome. The precision with which you can see the activation patterns and then use that information to rewire it is profound.  Sigal Samuel  It was really striking to me that you wrote that you would try DecNef if given the chance. That set me off wondering for myself personally. On the one hand, it sounds amazing, this idea of neurotech healing traumatic memory or even preventing it from getting established in the brain to begin with.  On the other hand, I was thinking about how my dad passed away about a year ago. In the last year of his life, I was caring for him and it was really intense. I think probably there was some kind of trauma incurred there. And as a result, the past year has been one of the hardest years of my life.  If you'd asked me earlier whether I want to sign up for this thing that will prevent that mental anguish, I might have been tempted. But a year later, having gone through that suffering, I actually think there was a lot of growth that thankfully I was able to come out of it with. More self-compassion and compassion. It reminds me of this concept of post-traumatic growth, where people come out of an experience with new capacities -- the flip side of PTSD. And in the book you also write that as a result of your experience, you feel like you came out with more compassion and you're a stronger ethicist.  Nita Farahany  Yeah, I don't think I would've used DecNef ex ante. There is something really important about suffering. It has been core to the human condition. It helps us to prevail. So much poetry and music and everything else comes from suffering.  I say I would have used it because the trauma echoed for years and I couldn't sleep, and it was vivid in ways that... I couldn't function. I would never want to forget Callista or what we went through with Callista. But living through it -- from the emotional power of it, to the fear, to the smells, to the echoes of the sounds in my brain -- I did not need it at that level.  And so if DecNef could help turn it down so that when I remembered it, I could remember as I do now, with fondness ... but not literally relive it -- I would, I would do that. I would regain that time to not relive that over and over again.  Sigal Samuel  Absolutely. That makes a ton of sense. This is something that I was genuinely struggling with while reading, because on the one hand I felt this sense of, I don't want to cheat myself out of an opportunity for potential post-traumatic growth, but also, I think there really is such a thing as too much suffering.  The Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh has a phrase I really like:  No mud, no lotus.  Meaning, some suffering can be fertile ground for growth. But when he was presented with the question of how much we should suffer, he said,  Not too much!  Because that can just be like a landslide that we don't know how to pull ourselves out of.  Nita Farahany  I think that's right. I hope that people's choices are to not eliminate experiencing sadness and suffering. I don't want that. I don't think that's good for humanity. I also don't think it's up to me to decide for individuals what suffering they do and don't want to go through.  Sigal Samuel  Absolutely. And I want to underline that treating PTSD or depression is not the same as eliminating suffering. We should absolutely treat things like PTSD or depression. But I'm really not sure about the quest to eliminate suffering, as some people want to do in the transhumanist movement -- the movement that's all about using tech to usher in a new phase of human evolution.  You ask in your book:  If your brain had a switch to turn off suffering, would you use it?  I wouldn't.  Nita Farahany  I wouldn't. But I would turn down the volume for the years that followed [with PTSD], because I didn't need it at that volume."}, {"source": "recode", "title": "ChatGPT's makers release GPT-4, a new generative AI that understands images", "text": "When ChatGPT came out in November, it took the world by storm.  Within a month of its release, some 100 million people had used the viral AI chatbot for everything from writing high school essays to planning travel itineraries to generating computer code.  Built by the San Francisco-based startup OpenAI, the app was flawed in many ways, but it also sparked a wave of excitement (and fear) about the transformative power of generative AI to change the way we work and create.  ChatGPT, which runs on a technology called GPT-3.5, has been so impressive, in part, because it represents a quantum leap from the capabilities of its predecessor from just a few years ago, GPT-2.  On Tuesday, OpenAI released an even more advanced version of its technology: GPT-4. The company says this update is another milestone in the advancement of AI. The new technology has the potential to improve how people learn new languages, how blind people process images, and even how we do our taxes.  OpenAI also claims that the new model supports a chatbot that's more factual, creative, concise, and can understand images, instead of just text.  Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, called GPT-4  our most capable and aligned model yet.  He also cautioned that  it is still flawed, still limited, and it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it   GPT4 is capable of turning a picture of a napkin sketch to a fully functioning html/css/javascript website. pic.twitter.com/q6FLZL6oFO -- Lior (@AlphaSignalAI) March 14, 2023  In a livestream demo of GPT-4 on Tuesday afternoon, OpenAI co-founder and president Greg Brockman showed some new use cases for the technology, including the ability to be given a hand-drawn mockup of a website and, from that, generate code for a functional site in a matter of seconds.  Brockman also showcased GPT-4's visual capabilities by feeding it a cartoon image of a squirrel holding a camera and asking it to explain why the image is funny.   The image is funny because it shows a squirrel holding a camera and taking a photo of a nut as if it were a professional photographer. It's a humorous situation because squirrels typically eat nuts, and we don't expect them to use a camera or act like humans,  GPT-4 responded.  This is the sort of capability that could be incredibly useful to people who are blind or visually impaired. Not only can GPT-4 describe images, but it can also communicate the meaning and context behind them.  Still, as Altman and GPT-4's creators have been quick to admit, the tool is nowhere near fully replacing human intelligence. Like its predecessors, it has known problems around accuracy, bias, and context. That poses a growing risk as more people start using GPT-4 for more than just novelty. Companies like Microsoft, which invests heavily in OpenAI, are already starting to bake GPT-4 into core products that millions of people use.  Here are a few things you need to know about the latest version of the buzziest new technology in the market.  It can pass complicated exams  One tangible way people are measuring the capabilities of new artificial intelligence tools is by seeing how well they can perform on standardized tests, like the SAT and the bar exam.  GPT-4 has shown some impressive progress here. The technology can pass a simulated legal bar exam with a score that would put it in the top 10 percent of test takers, while its immediate predecessor GPT-3.5 scored in the bottom 10 percent (watch out, lawyers).  GPT-4 can also score a 700 out of 800 on the SAT math test, compared to a 590 in its previous version.  Still, GPT-4 is weak in certain subjects. It only scored a 2 out of 5 on the AP English Language exams -- the same score as the prior version, GPT-3.5, received.  Standardized tests are hardly a perfect measure of human intelligence, but the types of reasoning and critical thinking required to score well on these tests show that the technology is improving at an impressive clip.  It shows promise at teaching languages and helping the visually impaired  Since GPT-4 just came out, it will take time before people discover all of the most compelling ways to use it, but OpenAI has proposed a couple of ways the technology could potentially improve our daily lives.  One is for learning new languages. OpenAI has partnered with the popular language learning app Duolingo to power a new AI-based chat partner called Roleplay. This tool lets you have a free-flowing conversation in another language with a chatbot that responds to what you're saying and steps in to correct you when needed.  Another big use case that OpenAI pitched involves helping people who are visually impaired. In partnership with Be My Eyes, an app that lets visually impaired people get on-demand help from a sighted person via video chat, OpenAI used GPT-4 to create a virtual assistant that can help people understand the context of what they're seeing around them. One example OpenAI gave showed how, given a description of the contents of a refrigerator, the app can offer recipes based on what's available. The company says that's an advancement from the current state of technology in the field of image recognition.   Basic image recognition applications only tell you what's in front of you,  said Jesper Hvirring Henriksen, CTO of Be My Eyes, in a press release for GPT-4's launch.  They can't have a discussion to understand if the noodles have the right kind of ingredients or if the object on the ground isn't just a ball, but a tripping hazard -- and communicate that.   If you want to use OpenAI's latest GPT-4 powered chatbot, it isn't free  Right now, you'll have to pay $20 per month for access to ChatGPT Plus, a premium version of the ChatGPT bot. GPT4's API is also available to developers who can build apps on top of it for a fee proportionate to how much they're using the tool.  However, if you want a taste of GPT-4 without paying up, you can use a Microsoft-made chatbot called BingGPT. A Microsoft VP confirmed on Tuesday that the latest version of BingGPT is using GPT-4. It's important to note that BingGPT has limitations on how many conversations you can have a day, and it doesn't allow you to input images.  GPT-4 still has serious flaws. Researchers worry we don't know what data it's being trained on.  While GPT-4 has clear potential to help people, it's also inherently flawed. Like previous versions of generative AI models, GPT-4 can relay misinformation or be misused to share controversial content, like instructions on how to cause physical harm or content to promote political activism.  OpenAI says that GPT-4 is 40 percent more likely to give factual responses, and 82 percent less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content. While that's an improvement from before, there's still plenty of room for error.  Another concern about GPT-4 is the lack of transparency around how it was designed and trained. Several prominent academics and industry experts on Twitter pointed out that the company isn't releasing any information about the data set it used to train GPT-4. This is an issue, researchers argue, because the large datasets used to train AI chatbots can be inherently biased, as evidenced a few years ago by Microsoft's Twitter chatbot, Tay. Within a day of its release, Tay gave racist answers to simple questions. It had been trained on social media posts, which can often be hateful.  OpenAI says it's not sharing its training data in part because of competitive pressure. The company was founded as a nonprofit but became a for-profit entity in 2019, in part because of how expensive it is to train complex AI systems. OpenAI is now heavily backed by Microsoft, which is engaged in a fierce battle with Google over which tech giant will lead on generative AI technologies.  Without knowing what's under the hood, it's hard to immediately validate OpenAI's claims that its latest tool is more accurate and less biased than before. As more people use the technology in the coming weeks, we'll see if it ends up being not only meaningfully more useful but also more responsible than what came before it."}, {"source": "liberation", "title": "Le Kremlin fait monter la repression", "text": "par Louise Vincent, Interim a Moscou  Dans la capitale russe, ou les chutes de neige du week-end ont laisse la place a quelques eclaircies, c'est une audience sous haute tension qui se tient ce mardi.

The bank's collapse, explained.", "text": "If you work in tech, you had probably heard of Silicon Valley Bank before now. If you're not familiar with this seemingly regional bank, nobody's blaming you. It had billions of dollars in deposits, but fewer than two dozen branches, and generally catered to a very specific crowd of startups, venture capitalists, and tech firms. Anyway, you're here now -- Silicon Valley Bank isn't.  Banking regulators shut down Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, on Friday, March 10, after the bank suffered a sudden, swift collapse, marking the second-largest bank failure in US history. Just two days prior, SVB signaled that it was facing a cash crunch. It first tried to raise money by selling shares and then it tried to sell itself, but the whole thing spooked investors, and ultimately, it went under. On Sunday, March 12, the federal government said it would step in to make sure all of the bank's depositors would have access to their funds by Monday, March 13. Regulators also shuttered another bank, Signature Bank of New York, which had gotten into crypto, and the federal government said its depositors' money would be guaranteed as well.   Thanks to the quick action my administration [has taken] over the past few days, Americans can have confidence that the banking system is safe. Your deposits will be there when you need them,  President Joe Biden said on Monday, March 13, in brief remarks delivered on the White House's response. He emphasized that taxpayers won't wind up footing the bill for the government's actions:  Instead, the money will come from the fees that banks pay into the [FDIC] deposit insurance fund.   In late March, the North Carolina-based First Citizens Bank said it had entered into an agreement to acquire Silicon Valley Bank, ending the FDIC's rather long search for a buyer.  The incident sent shock waves across the tech sector. When signs of shakiness at SVB began to show, many companies and people with money in SVB moved to pull it out earlier in the week -- actions that, ironically, contributed to the bank's demise. Not everyone was able to get their cash out, and the FDIC only insures deposits up to $250,000, so customers who had more than that in SVB have spent some days in a panic, though the government ultimately said their money will be there for them.  Beyond tech, this caused some shakiness across the banking industry, especially regional banks, amid concerns that other banks could be in trouble or that contagion could set in. (It's important to note for consumers here that, really, the money you have in the bank right now is almost definitely fine.) It also had ripple effects in Europe. SVB's blowup is a big deal and a symptom of bigger forces in motion in tech, finance, and the economy.  Michael Barr, the Federal Reserve's vice chair of supervision, is now leading a review of SVB's supervision to try to decipher what happened. The Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission are reportedly undertaking probes as well.  Still confused about what's going on? Here are the answers to nine questions you might just have. We'll also be updating this list as this story develops.  1) What is SVB, and how big is it?  Silicon Valley Bank was founded in 1983 in Santa Clara, California, and quickly became the bank for the burgeoning tech sector there and the people who financed it (as was its intention). The bank itself claimed to bank for nearly half of all US venture-backed startups as of 2021. It's also a banking partner for a lot of the venture capital firms that fund those startups. SVB calls itself the  financial partner of the innovation economy.  All that basically means it's tightly woven into the financial infrastructure of the tech industry, especially startups.  (Disclosure: It's not just the tech industry that banked with SVB. Vox Media, which owns Vox, also banked with SVB before its closure.)  This arrangement has been great for SVB when things were great for the tech industry and not so great when they weren't. But for a long time now, things have been very, very good, and venture capitalists were giving a lot of money to a lot of startups and going through SVB to do it. SVB had more than $200 billion in assets when it failed, which is far less than, say, JPMorgan Chase's $3.31 trillion or so. But SVB is the largest bank to fail since the Great Recession, as well as, again, one of the largest US banks to fail ever. --Sara Morrison  2) What happened to SVB?  Silicon Valley Bank met its demise largely as the result of a good old-fashioned bank run after signs of trouble began to emerge in the second week of March. The bank takes deposits from clients and invests them in generally safe securities, like bonds. As the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, those bonds have become worth less. That wouldn't normally be an issue -- SVB would just wait for those bonds to mature -- but because there's been a slowdown in venture capital and tech more broadly, deposit inflows slowed, and clients started withdrawing their money.  On Wednesday, March 8, SVB's parent company, SVB Financial Group, said it would undertake a $2.25 billion share sale after selling $21 billion of securities from its portfolio at a nearly $2 billion loss. The move was meant to shore up its balance sheet. Instead, it spooked markets and clients. The share price of SVB Financial plunged on Thursday. By Friday morning, trading of the stock was halted, and there was reporting SVB was in talks to sell. Big-name VCs such as Peter Thiel and Union Square Ventures reportedly started to tell their companies to pull their money out of the bank while they could.   People started freaking out, and unfortunately, it would appear rightly so,  said Alexander Yokum, an analyst at CFRA Research who covers banking. By about midday Friday, regulators shut down the bank. --Emily Stewart  3) How did this happen so fast?  Part of SVB's specific problem is that it was so concentrated in its business. SVB catered to venture capital and private equity -- as that sector has done well over the past decade, so has SVB. But because the bank was also very concentrated with high exposure to one industry, that opened it up to risk. When things got bad for its non-diversified group of clients, it very quickly got bad for the bank.   This has proven that having 50 percent plus of your business in one industry is very dangerous. They outperformed on the way up, but on the way down, that's when you figure out how exposed you are,  Yokum said.  It didn't help that another bank, Silvergate, which catered to crypto, said it was winding down around the same time or, again, that once there were signs of trouble at SVB, everybody kind of freaked out.  This is not a slow fall from grace here, this is quick,  Yokum said. It was one of the largest banks in the US, and it went down in a matter of two days. --ES  4) What does this mean for the banking system, and just how worried should I be about my bank?  There's an argument to be made that it's good for banks to fail from time to time. The longest stretch in US history without a bank failure was from 2004 to 2007, and, well, you know what happened after that. The overall banking industry is likely fine, and again, SVB probably would have made it through had everybody not freaked out at the same time. That said, SVB's collapse isn't great, especially for the people who are going to be stuck holding the bag. There continue to be concerns about the health of the broader banking system.   There's always a risk of contagion, because banking is fundamentally a game of trust and confidence,  said Aaron Klein, a senior economics fellow at the think tank Brookings Institution.  When they erode, the system becomes less stable.   Yokum added there could be more trouble ahead as the Fed continues to increase interest rates in an attempt to cool down the economy and bring down inflation, especially if it does so aggressively.  The more rates go up, the more the banks on the edge start to become a problem,  Yokum said.  On March 22, the Fed said it would raise interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point, less than the half a point it was expected to raise rates, but also a sign it remains focused on fighting inflation.  Still, you don't need to start pulling your dollars out of your bank and hiding them under your mattress. Also, remember up to $250,000 of bank deposits are insured by the federal government, so unless you've got more than that in there -- which, if you do, congratulations -- really, you're fine. --ES  5) What does this mean for tech companies in the near term?  The most immediate issue for tech companies that had money tied up with SVB and haven't gotten it out yet is a Very Big Question that doesn't have obvious answers: What happens when I need to pay someone, like my employees?  While the FDIC has guaranteed deposits of up to $250,000, depending on the size of the company, that money wouldn't go very far. This doesn't just apply to companies that deposited cash with SVB -- it's also a question for companies using other SVB instruments, like revolver loans or credit cards. Vox Media, for instance, used SVB cards.  There were also real concerns about knock-on effects: Even if your startup didn't use SVB, your vendors might have. And while the government's announcement should give most companies assurance that they'll be able to get their money back eventually, there will likely be some kinks to work out in the near term. --Peter Kafka  6) Why was SVB important to tech companies, and what made them different than other banks?  One way to gauge SVB's influence in the tech world was to attend a tech conference, where SVB was often a prominent sponsor (and, sometimes, its executives were also featured speakers).  But most of the connections happened behind the scenes: Unlike other banks, tech industry observers say, SVB was willing to work with tech startups in ways other banks might have been more reluctant to, like helping early employees secure personal loans for a house.  More importantly, SVB was particularly flexible about lending tech startups money even though they didn't have free cash flow (because tech startups usually lose money at the beginning of their lives) or much in the way of assets (because startups often don't have much more than the brains of their founders and early employees when they launch).  If you are a startup company, you don't look like a normal business,  says Sean Byrnes, a startup founder and investor who says he has used SVB for years.  Most banks, if you go to them and ask for a loan, they'll laugh at you.  SVB was also often willing to work with founders who weren't US citizens, which would be an obstacle for more traditional banks.  The upside for SVB could be meaningful, since in addition to charging interest, the company often received stock warrants that could pay off if the startup got acquired or went public. And when tech was on a tear, the downside was limited: Even failed companies were more likely to pay back SVB's loans before other investors got their money back, and there would be a steady pipeline of other tech companies lined up to use their services. --PK  7) Did SVB collapse so quickly because it was tied to tech?  It certainly seems that way. That's in large part because the tech startup world is tightly plugged into itself, with founders and executives constantly trading information and boasting on Twitter or text chains or Signal chats. One tech company pulling its money out of a bank is a story that quickly cascades to the leaders of other companies, who then tell leaders of other companies.   [SVB was] uniquely susceptible given the communication interconnectedness,  says Charlie O'Donnell, a partner at VC firm Brooklyn Bridge Ventures.  And it wasn't just tech founders talking to themselves: On Thursday, March 9, a wave of venture capitalists were explicitly telling their portfolio companies to take their money out of SVB immediately. A startup founder who doesn't bank with SVB told Vox he got five calls that day from different investors telling him to pull his money.  Looking forward to the tweets from the VCs who sparked this bank run congratulating themselves on their prescience. -- Matt Harris (@mattcharris) March 10, 2023  O'Donnell says he told his portfolio companies to do the same. He says about a third of the 60-odd companies in his portfolio used SVB, and that by the end of Thursday, all except one had pulled their funds.  There are other, related theories floating in techland, which will be harder to prove but certainly seem plausible. One is that tech founders were more susceptible to panic because they were acutely aware of recent crypto crashes, most notably at FTX, and didn't want to get pulled under. Another is that youngish tech founders generally don't have longstanding relationships with their banks, and may have never met their bankers in person, making it easier for them to see banks as commodities that can easily be swapped for each other. --PK  8) What is FDIC insurance, and how does it work? And will SVB customers get their $250,000 back?  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created in the wake of the Great Depression, when a lot of banks failed and their customers lost all of their money, to protect consumers who use American banks and provide some stability to the American banking system. If a member bank fails, its deposits -- that's the money you've put in said bank -- are still insured for up to $250,000. Anything beyond that, and there's no guarantee you'll ever see again.  At least, that's how it used to work. A few days after SVB's failure, the Federal Reserve Board, Department of the Treasury, and the FDIC announced that it would  make available additional funding to eligible depository institutions,  which would reimburse depositors in full. That funding, the announcement said, will come from loans from the newly created Bank Term Funding Program.  Because this is so new, we don't yet know exactly how it will all work or when depositors can expect to get their money back. The FDIC said earlier that the $250,000 insured funds would be available no later than Monday, March 13. It's still trying to figure out who exceeds that $250,000 cap and by how much. If you're one of them, FDIC wants you to call 1-866-799-0959. --SM  9) What's happening with regional banks? Is the government just doing bailouts again?  The landscape is not looking incredible for regional banks right now, at least in the near term, as fear spreads they might face similar issues as SVB. But these troubles may be limited to the more specialized banks. That remains to be seen.  After New York state regulators shut down Signature Bank, which had become an important lender in the crypto industry, a storm appeared to be brewing around San Francisco's First Republic Bank as well. Troubles there have eased but continue, and there are general jitters around US banks, especially regional ones, overall. In Europe, the long-troubled Credit Suisse was taken over by UBS in mid-March amid fresh turmoil.  Yokum, from CFRA, said he wouldn't be surprised if a couple of other banks run into trouble, but likely not many -- and not the big ones, such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America.  It will likely stay concentrated to a few select banks,  he said.  They're diversified, and they have a ton of deposits. So even if they lose some, they're still okay. They're not close to the line of having to sell securities. I really do think it's banks that cater to high net worth individuals and specialized banks.   As to whether the government's move to make SVB and Signature Bank depositors whole counts as a bailout, the answer is, well, pretty much yes. The White House has been careful to emphasize that this isn't a 2008-esque situation because SVB and Signature aren't going to be revived just as they were, and the money for depositors would come from a fund banks pay into, not taxpayers. But whatever technicalities aside, this is a bailout -- the banks went under, the government is stepping in. When Vox asked Klein, of the Brookings Institution, whether this counts as a bailout, his response was simply:  BAILOUT all caps level.  --ES  Update, March 28, 10:15 am ET: This story was originally published on March 10 and has been updated several times to include developments around the SVB collapse, including most recently First Citizens' purchase of SVB."}, {"source": "reddit-r-all", "title": "How it went down in a parallel universe.", "text": "Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/lotrmemes.

GPT-4 was already in action -- Microsoft has been using it to power Bing's new assistant function. The people behind OpenAI have written that they think the best way to handle powerful AI systems is to develop and release them as quickly as possible, and that's certainly what they're doing.  Also on Tuesday, I sat down with Holden Karnofsky, the co-founder and co-CEO of Open Philanthropy, to talk about AI and where it's taking us.  Karnofsky, in my view, should get a lot of credit for his prescient views on AI. Since 2008, he's been engaging with what was then a small minority of researchers who were saying that powerful AI systems were one of the most important social problems of our age -- a view that I think has aged remarkably well. (Karnofsky was a board member of OpenAI but stepped down in 2021 when his wife -- a former employee of OpenAI -- helped launch the AI company Anthropic. Open Philanthropy provided a $30 million grant to OpenAI in 2017.)  Some of his early published work on the question, from 2011 and 2012, raises questions about what shape those models will take, and how hard it would be to make developing them go well -- all of which will only look more important with a decade of hindsight.  In the last few years, he's started to write about the case that AI may be an unfathomably big deal -- and about what we can and can't learn from the behavior of today's models. Over that same time period, Open Philanthropy has been investing more in making AI go well. And recently, Karnofsky announced a leave of absence from his work at Open Philanthropy to explore working directly on AI risk reduction.  The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.  Kelsey Piper  You've written about how AI could mean that things get really crazy in the near future.  Holden Karnofsky  The basic idea would be: Imagine what the world would look like in the far future after a lot of scientific and technological development. Generally, I think most people would agree the world could look really, really strange and unfamiliar. There's a lot of science fiction about this.  What is most high stakes about AI, in my opinion, is the idea that AI could potentially serve as a way of automating all the things that humans do to advance science and technology, and so we could get to that wild future a lot faster than people tend to imagine.  Today, we have a certain number of human scientists who try to push forward science and technology. The day that we're able to automate everything they do, that could be a massive increase in the amount of scientific and technological advancement that's getting done. And furthermore, it can create a kind of feedback loop that we don't have today where basically as you improve your science and technology that leads to a greater supply of hardware and more efficient software that runs a greater number of AIs.  And because AIs are the ones doing the science and technology research and advancement, that could go in a loop. If you get that loop, you get very explosive progress.  The upshot of all this is that the world most people imagine thousands of years from now in some wild sci-fi future could be more like 10 years out or one year out or months out from the point when AI systems are doing all the things that humans typically do to advance science and technology.  This all follows straightforwardly from standard economic growth models, and there are signs of this kind of feedback loop in parts of economic history.  Kelsey Piper  That sounds great, right? Star Trek future overnight? What's the catch?  Holden Karnofsky  I think there are big risks. I mean, it could be great. But as you know, I think that if all we do is we kind of sit back and relax and let scientists move as fast as they can, we'll get some chance of things going great and some chance of some things going terribly.  I am most focused on standing up where normal market forces will not and trying to push against the probability of things going terribly. In terms of how things could go terribly, maybe I'll start with the broad intuition: When we talk about scientific progress and economic growth, we're talking about the few percent per year range. That's what we've seen in the last couple hundred years. That's all any of us know.   No one has any idea what that's going to look like, and I think we shouldn't assume that the result is going to be good for humans   But how you would feel about an economic growth rate of, let's say, 100 percent per year, 1,000 percent per year. Some of how I feel is that we just are not ready for what's coming. I think society has not really shown any ability to adapt to a rate of change that fast. The appropriate attitude towards the next sort of Industrial Revolution-sized transition is caution.  Another broad intuition is that these AI systems we're building, they might do all the things humans do to automate scientific and technological advancement, but they're not humans. If we get there, that would be the first time in all of history that we had anything other than humans capable of autonomously developing its own new technologies, autonomously advancing science and technology. No one has any idea what that's going to look like, and I think we shouldn't assume that the result is going to be good for humans. I think it really depends on how the AIs are designed.  If you look at this current state of machine learning, it's just very clear that we have no idea what we're building. To a first approximation, the way these systems are designed is that someone takes a relatively simple learning algorithm and they pour in an enormous amount of data. They put in the whole internet and it sort of tries to predict one word at a time from the internet and learn from that. That's an oversimplification, but it's like they do that and out of that process pops some kind of thing that can talk to you and make jokes and write poetry, but no one really knows why.  You can think of it as analogous to human evolution, where there were lots of organisms and some survived and some didn't and at some point there were humans who have all kinds of things going on in their brains that we still don't really understand. Evolution is a simple process that resulted in complex beings that we still don't understand.  When Bing chat came out and it started threatening users and, you know, trying to seduce them and god knows what, people asked, why is it doing that? And I would say not only do I not know, but no one knows because the people who designed it don't know, the people who trained it don't know.  Kelsey Piper  Some people have argued that yes, you're right, AI is going to be a huge deal, dramatically transform our world overnight, and that that's why we should be racing forwards as much as possible because by releasing technology sooner we'll give society more time to adjust.  Holden Karnofsky  I think there's some pace at which that would make sense and I think the pace AI could advance may be too fast for that. I think society just takes a while to adjust to anything.  Most technologies that come out, it takes a long time for them to be appropriately regulated, for them to be appropriately used in government. People who are not early adopters or tech lovers learn how to use them, integrate them into their lives, learn how to avoid the pitfalls, learn how to deal with the downsides.  So I think that if we may be on the cusp of a radical explosion in growth or in technological progress, I don't really see how rushing forward is supposed to help here. I don't see how it's supposed to get us to a rate of change that is slow enough for society to adapt, if we're pushing forward as fast as we can.   Is there a way to articulate how we'll know when the risk of some of these catastrophes is going up from the systems?   I think the better plan is to actually have a societal conversation about what pace we do want to move at and whether we want to slow things down on purpose and whether we want to move a bit more deliberately and if not, how we can have this go in a way that avoids some of the key risks or that reduces some of the key risks.  Kelsey Piper  So, say you're interested in regulating AI, to make some of these changes go better, to reduce the risk of catastrophe. What should we be doing?  Holden Karnofsky  I am quite worried about people feeling the need to do something just to do something. I think many plausible regulations have a lot of downsides and may not succeed. And I cannot currently articulate specific regulations that I really think are going to be like, definitely good. I think this needs more work. It's an unsatisfying answer, but I think it's urgent for people to start thinking through what a good regulatory regime could look like. That is something I've been spending increasingly a large amount of my time just thinking through.  Is there a way to articulate how we'll know when the risk of some of these catastrophes is going up from the systems? Can we set triggers so that when we see the signs, we know that the signs are there, we can pre-commit to take action based on those signs to slow things down based on those signs. If we are going to hit a very risky period, I would be focusing on trying to design something that is going to catch that in time and it's going to recognize when that's happening and take appropriate action without doing harm. That's hard to do. And so the earlier you get started thinking about it, the more reflective you get to be.  Kelsey Piper  What are the biggest things you see people missing or getting wrong about AI?  Holden Karnofsky  One, I think people will often get a little tripped up on questions about whether AI will be conscious and whether AI will have feelings and whether AI will have things that it wants.  I think this is basically entirely irrelevant. We could easily design systems that don't have consciousness and don't have desires, but do have  aims  in the sense that a chess-playing AI aims for checkmate. And the way we design systems today, and especially the way I think that things could progress, is very prone to developing these kinds of systems that can act autonomously toward a goal.  Regardless of whether they're conscious, they could act as if they're trying to do things that could be dangerous. They may be able to form relationships with humans, convince humans that they're friends, convince humans that they're in love. Whether or not they really are, that's going to be disruptive.  The other misconception that will trip people up is that they will often make this distinction between wacky long-term risks and tangible near-term risks. And I don't always buy that distinction. I think in some ways the really wacky stuff that I talk about with automation, science, and technology, it's not really obvious why that will be upon us later than something like mass unemployment.   I don't know that the wacky stuff is going to come later and I don't know that it's going to happen slow enough for us to adapt to it   I've written one post arguing that it would be quite hard for an AI system to take all the possible jobs that even a pretty low-skill human could have. It's one thing for it to cause a temporary transition period where some jobs disappear and others appear, like we've had many times in the past. It's another thing for it to get to where there's absolutely nothing you can do as well as an AI, and I'm not sure we're gonna see that before we see AI that can do science and technological advancement. It's really hard to predict what capabilities we'll see in what order. If we hit the science and technology one, things will move really fast.  So the idea that we should focus on  near term  stuff that may or may not actually be nearer term and then wait to adapt to the wackier stuff as it happens? I don't know about that. I don't know that the wacky stuff is going to come later and I don't know that it's going to happen slow enough for us to adapt to it.  A third point where I think a lot of people get off the boat with my writing is just thinking this is all so wacky, we're talking about this giant transition for humanity where things will move really fast. That's just a crazy claim to make. And why would we think that we happen to be in this especially important time period? But it's actually -- if you just zoom out and you look at basic charts and timelines of historical events and technological advancement in the history of humanity, there's just a lot of reasons to think that we're already on an accelerating trend and that we already live in a weird time.  I think we all need to be very open to the idea that the next big transition -- something as big and accelerating as the Neolithic Revolution or Industrial Revolution or bigger -- could kind of come any time. I don't think we should be sitting around thinking that we have a super strong default that nothing weird can happen.  Kelsey Piper  I want to end on something of a hopeful note. What if humanity really gets our act together, if we spend the next decade, like working really hard on a good approach to this and we succeed at some coordination and we succeed somewhat on the technical side? What would that look like?  Holden Karnofsky  I think in some ways it's important to contend with the incredible uncertainty ahead of us. And the fact that even if we do a great job and are very rational and come together as humanity and do all the right things, things might just move too fast and we might just still have a catastrophe.  On the flip side -- I've used the term  success without dignity  -- maybe we could do basically nothing right and still be fine.  So I think both of those are true and I think all possibilities are open and it's important to keep that in mind. But if you want me to focus on the optimistic vision, I think there are a number of people today who work on alignment research, which is trying to kind of demystify these AI systems and make it less the case that we have these mysterious minds that we know nothing about and more the case that we understand where they're coming from. They can help us know what is going on inside them and to be able to design them so that they truly are things that help humans do what humans are trying to do, rather than things that have aims of their own and go off in random directions and steer the world in random ways.  Then I am hopeful that in the future there will be a regime developed around standards and monitoring of AI. The idea being that there's a shared sense that systems demonstrating certain properties are dangerous and those systems need to be contained, stopped, not deployed, sometimes not trained in the first place. And that regime is enforced through a combination of maybe self-regulation, but also government regulation, also international action.   If we meet the challenge well, it will increase the odds, but I actually do think we could get catastrophe or a great ending regardless because I think everything is very uncertain   If you get those things, then it's not too hard to imagine a world where AI is first developed by companies that are adhering to the standards, companies that have a good awareness of the risks, and that are being appropriately regulated and monitored and that therefore the first super powerful AIs that might be able to do all the things humans do to advance science and technology are in fact safe and are in fact used with a priority of making the overall situation safer.  For example, they might be used to develop even better alignment methods to make other AI systems easier to make safe, or used to develop better methods of enforcing standards and monitoring. And so you could get a loop where you have early, very powerful systems being used to increase the safety factor of later very powerful systems. And then you end up in a world where we have a lot of powerful systems, but they're all basically doing what they're supposed to be doing. They're all secure, they're not being stolen by aggressive espionage programs. And that just becomes essentially a force multiplier on human progress as it's been to date.  And so, with a lot of bumps in the road and a lot of uncertainty and a lot of complexity, a world like that might just end us up in the future where health has greatly improved, where we have a huge supply of clean energy, where social science has advanced. I think we could just end up in a world that is a lot better than today in the same sense that I do believe today is a lot better than a couple hundred years ago.  So I think there is a potential very happy ending here. If we meet the challenge well, it will increase the odds, but I actually do think we could get catastrophe or a great ending regardless because I think everything is very uncertain.

Toute la chaine d'attribution est embouteillee et risque d'exploser dans les annees a venir.  Les chiffres definitifs ne seront connus que dans quelques mois, mais deja les estimations donnent le tournis. En 2020, le nombre d'attributions de HLM devrait chuter de 20 %. Soit 100 000 logements sociaux de moins attribues par rapport a 2019, dans un marche pourtant deja exsangue (2,1 millions de personnes en attente), selon le rapport annuel sur le mal-logement de la Fondation Abbe-Pierre, publie ce mardi. Le secteur, comme tant d'autres, s'est enraye lors du premier confinement. <<On ne pouvait plus faire d'etat des lieux d'entree et de sortie, donc les locataires n'ont pas bouge. Et ils ont trop peur de l'avenir, donc ils ne partent plus>>, resume Emmanuelle Cosse, la presidente de l'Union sociale pour l'habitat (USH), qui represente les HLM. Les commissions d'attribution des logements ont, au mieux, nettement freine leur activite, au pire tout cesse durant des semaines. En Seine-Saint-Denis, certaines n'ont repris qu'en septembre ou octobre, soit apres six a sept mois de pause.  Rouages  Entre mars et mai, l'USH a constate une chute de 60 % des attributions. Avec la reprise progressive de l'activite des agences et un deuxieme confinement plus souple, cette baisse a donc ete ramenee a 20 % en fin d'annee. Mais Emmanuelle Cosse, qui fut aussi ministre du Logement, l'admet : <<[Ce retard], je ne sais pas si on va le resorber.>>  Car dans cette grosse machine qu'est le logement, tous les rouages sont imbriques, et tous ont ete grippes en meme temps. Dans le parc prive aussi, la paralysie a gagne locataires et proprietaires. Crainte de perdre son emploi, projets d'enfant remis a plus tard... Or, <<pour liberer un logement social, il faut que quelqu'un en parte et donc achete ou loue un appartement ailleurs>>, dit le directeur des etudes de la Fondation Abbe-Pierre, Manuel Domergue. En temps normal, 450 000 a 500 000 attributions ont lieu chaque annee.  Resultat, <<beaucoup de jeunes de 23, 24, 25 ans qui auraient aime partir de chez leurs parents ne le peuvent pas, illustre Manuel Domergue. Des gens qui etaient en foyer de jeunes travailleurs ne peuvent pas liberer les places, ce qui empeche ceux de l'aide sociale a l'enfance qui etaient dans des hotels d'acceder a ces structures plus adaptees pour eux. Et puis il y a des gens qui sont dans des taudis, a la rue, dans des bidonvilles...>> L'an passe, l'Etat a ouvert plusieurs milliers de places d'hebergement supplementaires afin de mettre les personnes les plus fragilisees a l'abri. Du coup, <<il y a moins de personnes a la rue qu'il y a un an. Mais aussi un niveau inedit de personnes en hebergement. Theoriquement, elles sont la en attendant un logement, mais il y a tres peu de perspectives>>, previent Manuel Domergue. <<A Paris, sur les 3 000 attributions prevues pour les personnes sans domicile dans l'accord collectif departemental, seules 600 ont pu avoir lieu dans l'annee>>, note par exemple la Fondation Abbe-Pierre dans son rapport.  Autre grain de sable dans la machine : le ralentissement des constructions. Avant meme la pandemie, la production de logements neufs, tous types confondus, etait en perte de vitesse, avec une baisse de 9 % des mises en chantier au premier trimestre 2020. Au deuxieme trimestre, ce fut la degringolade : - 19 %. L'Observatoire credit logement CSA estime que le nombre de personnes accedant a la propriete baissera d'un quart entre 2019 et fin 2021. De quoi bloquer davantage les mouvements locatifs. <<Si on n'arrive pas a developper l'offre, je ne vois pas comment on va pouvoir repondre a la demande>>, souffle Emmanuelle Cosse. Rien que dans le parc HLM, <<il y a eu 23 000 logements sociaux en moins agrees en 2020. Ca fera des logements attribues en moins en 2023>>, le temps que les programmes sortent de terre, predit Manuel Domergue.  <<Endettes>>  Si la situation est preoccupante aujourd'hui, elle risque d'etre catastrophique a moyen terme. <<Ce grippage n'est pas juste une parenthese, ca va nous suivre pendant des annees et des annees>>, affirme Manuel Domergue. Avec des risques - accrus par la crise economique et sociale post-Covid - qui pendent au nez des locataires : les impayes locatifs et les expulsions. Grace au prolongement de la treve hivernale l'an passe, periode pendant laquelle les locataires ne peuvent etre mis a la porte, <<il y a eu 3 500 expulsions en 2020 contre 16 700 en 2019, indique Manuel Domergue. Mais ces gens sont toujours en sursis, toujours endettes, condamnes a l'expulsion>>.  Le prolongement de la treve mis en place par le gouvernement ne fera que retarder une sentence deja rendue. Puis d'autres personnes, aujourd'hui encore capables de se maintenir a flot, viendront grossir les rangs. <<Avant de ne plus payer leur loyer, elles demandent de l'aide a leurs amis, a leurs parents, liquident l'epargne qu'elles peuvent avoir, se privent sur d'autres depenses. Et apres tout ca, elles arretent de payer le loyer>>, analyse Manuel Domergue.

First, the company struggled to convince the public that it wasn't just for preteens making cringey memes; then it had to make the case that it wasn't responsible for the platform's rampant misinformation (or cultural appropriation ... or pro-anorexia content ... or potentially deadly trends ... or general creepiness, etc). But mostly, and especially over the past three years, TikTok has been fighting against increased scrutiny from US lawmakers about its ties to the Chinese government via its China-based parent company, ByteDance.  Some of the scrutiny has resulted in partial TikTok bans on government-owned devices in the federal and the majority of state governments. Several bills have now been introduced that would ban TikTok outright. On March 7, a bipartisan group of 12 senators unveiled what might be the biggest threat to TikTok yet: a bill that would lay the groundwork for the president to ban the app.  Meanwhile, a government interagency committee that has been investigating TikTok for years appears to be on the cusp of ordering ByteDance to divest, or sell off, the app. That would take the potential Chinese threat out of the equation entirely -- but only if ByteDance and China agree to it. As reports about a possible forced divestiture swirled, TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, told the Wall Street Journal that he thinks the company's efforts to wall off the app's US user data and recommendation algorithms from Chinese interference are more than enough to satisfy any national security concerns.  But banning TikTok isn't as simple as flipping a switch and deleting the app from every American's phone, even if this new bill does pass. It's a complex knot of technical and political decisions that could have consequences for US-China relations, for the cottage industry of influencers that has blossomed over the past five years, and for culture at large. The whole thing could also be overblown.  The thing is, nobody really knows if a TikTok ban, however broad or all-encompassing, will even happen or how it would work if it did. It's been three years since the US government has seriously begun considering the possibility, but the future remains just as murky as ever. Here's what we know so far.  1) Do politicians even use TikTok? Do they know how it works or what they're trying to ban?  Among the challenges lawmakers face in trying to ban TikTok outright is a public relations problem. Americans already think their government leaders are too old, ill-equipped to deal with modern tech, and generally out of touch. A kind of tradition has even emerged whenever Congress tries to do oversight of Big Tech: A committee will convene a hearing, tech CEOs will show up, and then lawmakers will make fools of themselves by asking questions that reveal how little they know about the platforms they're trying to rein in.  Congress has never heard from Chew, TikTok's CEO, in a public committee hearing before, but representatives will get their chance on March 23. Unlike with many of the American social media companies they've scrutinized before, few members of Congress have extensive experience with TikTok. Few use it for campaign purposes, and even fewer use it for official purposes. Though at least a few dozen members have some kind of account, most don't have big followings. There are some notable exceptions: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Reps. Katie Porter (D-CA), Jeff Jackson (D-NC), and Ilhan Omar (D-MN) use it frequently for official and campaign reasons and have big followings, while Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) and Ed Markey (D-MA) are inactive on it after using it extensively during their campaigns in 2020 and 2021.  One vocal TikTok defender has emerged on the Democratic side: Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York organized a press briefing with dozens of TikTok creators on Capitol Hill Wednesday ahead of the congressional grilling of TikTok's CEO. Bowman, who uses TikTok frequently, called the consensus to try to restrict TikTok part of an anti-China  hysteria.  --Christian Paz  2) Who is behind these efforts? Who is trying to ban TikTok or trying to impose restrictions?  While TikTok doesn't have vocal defenders in Congress, it does have a long list of vocal antagonists from across the country, who span party and ideological lines in both the Senate and the House.  The leading Republicans hoping to ban TikTok are Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Josh Hawley of Missouri, and Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who is the new chair of the House select committee on competition with China. All three have introduced some kind of legislation attempting to ban the app or force its parent company ByteDance to sell the platform to an American company. Many more Republicans in both chambers who are critics of China, like Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ted Cruz of Texas, endorse some kind of tougher restriction on the app.  Sen. Angus King (I-ME) has also joined Rubio in introducing legislation that would ban the app.  Related Good luck explaining a TikTok ban to young people  Most, but not all, Democrats have been reluctant to support a ban, saying they would prefer a broader approach. In the House, Gallagher's Democratic counterpart, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, has also called for a ban or tougher restrictions, though he doesn't think a ban will happen this year.  Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators is offering a different option with the recently introduced Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act. Led by Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and John Thune (R-SD), it isn't an outright TikTok ban. Instead, it gives the government the authority to mitigate national security threats posed by technologies from hostile countries, up to a ban. TikTok would be subject to this bill. Warner, who runs the Senate Intelligence Committee, is perhaps the most vocal Democrat on the perceived dangers of TikTok, but had held off on signing on to a bill that would ban it specifically. --CP  3) What is the relationship between TikTok and the Chinese government? Do they have users' info?  If you ask TikTok, the company will tell you there is no relationship and that it has not and would not give US user data to the Chinese government.  But TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a company based in Beijing that is subject to Chinese laws. Those laws compel businesses to assist the government whenever it asks, which many believe would force ByteDance to give the Chinese government any user data it has access to whenever it asks for it. Or it could be ordered to push certain kinds of content, like propaganda or disinformation, on American users.  We don't know if this has actually happened at this point. We only know that it could, assuming ByteDance even has access to TikTok's US user data and algorithms. TikTok has been working hard to convince everyone that it has protections in place that wall off US user data from ByteDance and, by extension, the Chinese government. --Sara Morrison  4) What happens to people whose income comes from TikTok? If there is a ban, is it even possible for creators to find similar success on Reels or Shorts or other platforms?  Most people who've counted on TikTok as their main source of revenue have long been prepared for a possible ban. Fifteen years into the influencer industry, it's old hat that, eventually, social media platforms will betray their most loyal users in one way or another. Plus, after President Trump attempted a ban in the summer of 2020, many established TikTokers diversified their online presence by focusing more of their efforts on other platforms like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts.  That doesn't mean that losing TikTok won't hurt influencers. No other social platform is quite as good as TikTok at turning a completely unknown person or brand into a global superstar, thanks to its emphasis on discovery versus keeping people up to date on the users they already follow. Which means that without TikTok, it'll be far more difficult for aspiring influencers to see the kind of overnight success enjoyed by OG TikTokers.  Related The rise of the TikTok scold  The good news is that there's likely more money to be made on other platforms, specifically Instagram Reels. Creators can sometimes make tens of thousands of dollars per month from Instagram's creator fund, which rewards users with money based on the number of views their videos get. Instagram is also viewed as a safer, more predictable platform for influencers in their dealings with brands, which can use an influencer's previous metrics to set a fair rate for the work. (It's a different story on TikTok, where even a post by someone with millions of followers could get buried by the algorithm, and it's less evident that past success will continue in the future.) --Rebecca Jennings  5) What does the TikTok ban look like to me, the user? Am I going to get arrested for using TikTok?  Almost certainly not. The most likely way a ban would happen would be through an executive order that cites national security grounds to forbid business transactions with TikTok. Those transactions would likely be defined as services that facilitate the app's operations and distribution. Which means you might have a much harder time finding and using TikTok, but you won't go to jail if you do. --SM  6) How is it enforced? What does the TikTok ban look like to the App Store and other businesses?  The most viable path as of now is using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president broader powers than he otherwise has. President Trump used this when he tried to ban TikTok in 2020, and lawmakers have since introduced TikTok-banning bills that essentially call for the current president to try again, but this time with additional measures in place that might avoid the court battles that stalled Trump's attempt.  Trump's ban attempt does give us some guidance on what such a ban would look like, however. The Trump administration spelled out some examples of banned transactions, including app stores not being allowed to carry it and internet hosting services not being allowed to host it. If you have an iPhone, it's exceedingly difficult to get a native app on your phone that isn't allowed in Apple's App Store -- or to get updates for that app if you downloaded it before this hypothetical ban came down. It's also conceivable that companies would be prohibited from advertising on the app and content creators wouldn't be able to use TikTok's monetization tools.  There are considerable civil and criminal penalties for violating the IEEPA. Don't expect Apple or Google or Mr. Beast to do so.  The RESTRICT Act would give the president another way to ban TikTok, as it gives the Commerce Department the authority to review and investigate information and communication technology from countries deemed to be adversaries, which would include TikTok and China. The commerce secretary could then recommend to the president which actions should be taken to mitigate any national security threat these technologies pose, up to banning them. The White House supports this bill. But a lot of things would have to happen before it's a viable option to ban TikTok. First and foremost, the bill would have to actually pass. --SM  7) On what grounds would TikTok be reinstated? Are there any changes big enough that would make it  safe  in the eyes of the US government?  TikTok is already trying to make those changes to convince a multi-agency government panel that it can operate in the US without being a national security risk. If that panel, called the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), can't reach an agreement with TikTok, then it's doubtful there's anything more TikTok can do. CFIUS has been investigating TikTok for years now. An agreement that would allow TikTok to stay in the US seemed imminent last summer, but it was never finalized.  And it's not looking very promising that it will be. Though a final decision still has not been made, recent reports say that CFIUS is pushing for ByteDance to sell off TikTok, ideally to a US-based company. The Biden administration declined to comment. That move was considered back in the Trump administration and would presumably take most (if not all) of the heat off TikTok. TikTok doesn't think that would address the underlying issues.   A change in ownership would not impose any new restrictions on data flows or access,  spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter told Vox.  The best way to address concerns about national security is with the transparent, US-based protection of US user data and systems, with robust third-party monitoring, vetting, and verification, which we are already implementing.   Even if ByteDance wanted to sell TikTok, it may not be allowed to. The Chinese government would have to approve such a sale, and it's made it pretty clear that it won't. --SM  8) Is there any kind of precedent for banning apps?  China and other countries do ban US apps. The TikTok app doesn't even exist in China. It has a domestic version, called Douyin, instead. TikTok also isn't in India, which banned it in 2020. So there is precedent for other countries banning apps, including TikTok. But these are different countries with different laws. That kind of censorship doesn't really fly here. President Trump's attempt to ban TikTok in 2020 wasn't going well in the courts, but we never got an ultimate decision because Trump lost the election and the Biden administration rescinded the order.  The closest thing we have to the TikTok debacle is probably Grindr. A Chinese company bought the gay dating app in 2018, only to be forced by CFIUS to sell it off the next year. It did, thus avoiding a ban. So we don't know how a TikTok ban would play out if it came down to it. --SM  9) How overblown is this?  At the moment, there's no indication that the Chinese government has asked for private data of American citizens from ByteDance, or that the parent company has provided that information to Chinese government officials. But American user data has reportedly been accessed by China-based employees of ByteDance, according to a BuzzFeed News investigation last year. The company has also set up protocols under which employees abroad could remotely access American data. The company stresses that this is no different from how other  global companies  operate and that it is moving to funnel all US data through American servers. But the possibility of the Chinese government having access to this data at some point is fueling the national security concerns in the US.  This doesn't speak to the other reasons driving government scrutiny of the app: data privacy and mental health. Some elected officials would like to see stricter rules and regulations in place limiting the kind of information that younger Americans have to give up when using TikTok and other platforms, (like Markey, the senator from Massachusetts), while others would like a closer look at limits on when children can use the app as part of broader regulations on Big Tech. Democratic members of Congress have also cited concerns with how much time children are spending online, potentially detrimental effects of social media, including TikTok, on children, and the greater mental health challenges younger Americans are facing today. TikTok is already making efforts to fend off this criticism: At the start of March, they announced new screen time limits for users under the age of 17. But even those measures are more like suggestions. --CP  Update, March 23, 10 am ET: This story was originally published on March 2 and has been updated multiple times, most recently to reflect developments around TikTok's CEO testifying before Congress."}, {"source": "spiegel-online", "title": "Grunen-Kandidatin Fegebank vor der Hamburg-Wahl: Die Erste Burgermeisterin", "text": "Zur Unterstutzung ist die Bundesspitze der Partei zur traditionellen Jahresauftaktklausur nach Hamburg gekommen.

Now 4 more cars with ethanol could spill", "text": "CNN --  A train hauling ethanol derailed Thursday morning in Raymond, Minnesota, igniting several rail cars and forcing a mandatory evacuation of the city of about 800, officials said.  The fire was still burning more than 14 hours after the derailment, the US Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday afternoon. An EPA team was in Raymond by 6:30 a.m. to conduct air quality monitoring.  The EPA said four cars that contained ethanol, which is highly flammable,  ruptured, caught fire  and continued to burn, and warned Thursday morning there were additional cars containing ethanol that  may also release.   In a 3 p.m. update, the agency said the four cars burning had  denatured ethanol - ethanol containing gasoline to be used as a fuel additive,  and that crews were assessing impacts  to the three remaining denatured ethanol cars.   Firefighters stand near piled up train cars, near Raymond on March 30, 2023. Kerem Yucel/Minnesota Public Radio/AP  The train, operated by BNSF Railway, derailed around 1 a.m. Homes within a half-mile of the derailment were evacuated, the Kandiyohi County Sheriff's Office said.   There have been no injuries as a result of the crash or emergency response,  the sheriff's office posted on Facebook.  The evacuation order was lifted midday Thursday.   Residents may return safely to their homes. There will be road detours in the area around the site,  the sheriff's department said.  There is no impact to groundwater. Local responders and BNSF personnel continue to work to mitigate the incident.   The EPA said Thursday afternoon it was monitoring the air for particulate matter and volatile organic compounds and was also overseeing BNSF's air monitoring efforts. The evacuation order was lifted based on preliminary air monitoring data from the EPA and BNSF, the federal agency added.   EPA has not found any (particulate matter) levels of concern in the community and so far, low levels below health concerns of (volatile organic compounds) have been detected only immediately downwind of the cars in a non-populated area,  the EPA said.  The foam that authorities will use to put out the blaze will not contain PFAS chemicals, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a Thursday news conference. PFAS, or  forever chemicals,  are a family of ubiquitous synthetic chemicals that linger in the environment and the human body, where they can cause serious health problems.  The governor said the  relatively frozen ground  in the area will likely help with remediation efforts because the ethanol should burn off more easily. He added that the state's pollution control agency will work to ensure there is no runoff into local water sources.  How this crash differs from the East Palestine wreck  The fiery derailment in Raymond happened almost two months after a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous chemicals derailed in East Palestine, Ohio.  That disaster ignited a dayslong inferno, spewed poisonous fumes into the air and killed thousands of fish. It also left East Palestine residents wondering if a variety of health problems since the derailment are liked to the wreck.  Both freight trains were carrying highly flammable and potentially toxic chemicals, such as vinyl chloride in Ohio and ethanol in Minnesota.  Preliminary information from Minnesota suggests 14 of the train's 40 cars were carrying hazardous material,  including ethanol, which was released - leading to a fire,  US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg told CNN Thursday.  In addition to ethanol, the train was carrying mixed freight including corn syrup, said Lena Kent, general director of public affairs for BNSF Railway.  Firefighters work near piled up train cars, near Raymond on March 30, 2023. Kerem Yucel/Minnesota Public Radio/AP  Ethanol can explode when mixed with vapor and air. Ethanol exposure can lead to coughing, dizziness, the feeling of burning eyes, drowsiness and unconsciousness.  But there are differences between the chemicals on board the trains in Minnesota and Ohio, says Purdue University professor Andrew Whelton.   Ethanol, like many chemicals, can be toxic if inhaled or comes into contact with skin or is ingested. But it requires a certain concentration to be a health hazard,  said Whelton, an expert in environmental chemistry and water quality.  Ethanol is highly soluble in water, meaning it will be relatively easy to dilute.  Dilution is one way to reduce the risk  of health issues from any water that may be contaminated with ethanol, Whelton said.  By contrast, the chemicals released in the Ohio train wreck  are generally heavier and less soluble in water,  Whelton said.  They sunk to the bottom of the creek and stayed. They didn't flush away there.   But it's still not clear what may have been mixed with the ethanol on the train that derailed in Minnesota. While ethanol is a single compound, there are different blends of ethanol that may have different additives in them and could change the health risk, Whelton said.  A loud crash and a chemical stench  Brittney Phelps and her family were startled by a knock on their door at 1:30 a.m. It was a first responder going door to door telling residents to flee as a precaution.   I heard a loud crash but didn't think anything of it 'til ambulances were outside the house,  Phelps said.  She soon smelled the stench of ethanol and saw the wrecked train cars and large fire, Phelps told CNN.  Brittney Phelps, who lives near the derailment site, took this photo of a fire burning from the wreckage. Brittney Phelps  The Minnesota Department of Transportation closed a nearby highway due to the derailment and blaze, the fire department said. The main railroad track is blocked, and an estimated time for reopening the line was not available.  The cause of the derailment is under investigation.
